0,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Lockdown logbook for kids - Telegraph India,"Stuck at home all day under the constant supervision of parents can leave children edgy. The Telegraph draws up a list of activities that will keep them occupied and make the lockdown more bearable. Go online: Online courses can keep the young occupied and their parents content that the children are not whiling away their time aimlessly on the internet.Though several city schools are taking online classes, the students are still left with a lot of free time that can be used to brush up their skills in a particular subject or learn a new language or even a new discipline. “There are many websites where one can listen to lectures or work on assignments. All this is free, one has to pay a fee only if s/he wants a certificate,” education counsellor Nirmal Agarwal said.“Such courses offer deeper understanding of a particular subject or an opportunity to explore a subject outside the school curriculum,” Agarwal said.Online courses allow one to learn at his or her own pace and at a convenient time. All online courses need not be “utilitarian” but can help “engage the mind”.Teachers, however, warn that students must be guided by parents and teachers. Research for overseas applications: Many students will be applying to foreign universities in September-October and this time can be utilised to shortlist universities and prepare a statement of purpose. Many students are also getting in touch with career counsellors/teachers over email and WhatsApp for guidance in which college to choose for which discipline and the scholarships available. Modern High School for Girls pushes students to write a 2,000-word research essay that is not confined to the syllabus. “The statement of purpose is not only about academic excellence or the marks they have scored but can also be about community service. Research essays can be included in the statement and it shows how students are pushing boundaries,” Modern High School principal Damayanti Mukherjee said.Read and read out to the elderly: Every home has books and the teachers’ advice is to pick up one from the shelf and start reading.“Students are so busy with studies that they often don’t get time to read anything beyond the syllabus. Now, they can choose books that are not meant for exams. Maybe in history, they can pick up books on the freedom movement, renaissance or biographies of philosophers or thinkers or people who have overcome odds. If they read about people who have conquered odds, it will lift their spirits,” said Devi Kar, the director of Modern High.Some teachers suggest introducing reading schemes to encourage the habit. “They can be asked to read a book and respond to it by writing a review, making a scrap book, or an art installation,” said Sujata Sen, CEO of Future Hope. Some schools are also sending reading materials to students.“For middle school students, we have prepared PDF files of short stories that parents can download from the website and read aloud with the children,” said Anjana Saha, the principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy. “We have also sent messages to parents to use audio books,” Saha said.Another teacher suggested reading aloud to elderly members of the family. “Young children should read out to grandparents who have weak eyesight and cannot read. They should read out slowly to them, patiently and repeat when they cannot follow or ask them to do,” said Anuradha Das, the director of Garden High International School. Learn patience: This is the time to learn to be at peace with oneself and the surroundings instead of just looking for “instant gratification”, said Das. Parents should talk to their children and spend time with them. “Confinement is something they don’t like and they get restless. Their mental state becomes more important than the coronavirus, so this is the time when they can learn to be at peace with themselves and their immediate surroundings. We didn’t anticipate this and it is important to learn to cope with it,” Das said. Write journals: Students can maintain a daily or weekly record of their activities. Writing it all down will also improve writing skills and create memories. One could also take photos of some special moments with family members and attach them with notes.Counsellor’s tips: Psychiatrists say the present situation is a completely “unchartered territory” and is bound to create a “degree of uncertainty and stress”.Psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram said there are ways to spend time with family and do things that people do not get time to do. “Parents can learn computer games from their children, take out a family album and try and locate people in those albums,” said Ram. Video calls to relatives could also be a way to socialise.",2020-01-04 21:14:00
1,Chandreyee Ghose,Help at doorstep for senior citizens in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Octogenarian Dipti Bhattacharya and her husband ran out of their regular medicines last week and all the neighbourhood pharmacies refused to deliver. A group of young volunteers came to their rescue, bringing them the medicines in an hour.Several senior citizens across the city have been showering blessings on Let’s Help, a non-profit help group formed by professionals from the city that has been in operation since March 17.The group’s mission is to provide senior citizens with essential services, home-cooked food and medicines during the lockdown.It all started with a Facebook post by Debayan Datta, 33, who works in the hospitality industry.“Many of my friends work in other cities and countries while their elderly parents live on their own in Calcutta. To help the aged and vulnerable, I wanted to start a network of services that would provide them essentials at their doorstep at no charge in these trying times. So I posted on Facebook, calling for volunteers,” Datta said. Entrepreneur Debjani Mookherjee, professional Turni Dhar and brand strategist Luna Chatterjee were among the first to respond.Together, they started helping senior citizens, getting them everything from hand sanitisers and masks to groceries. “We began by helping senior citizens get hand sanitisers at the market rate when it was not available in any store,” Dhar said.Soon, they moved on to supplying groceries, homemade food, medicines as well as pet needs to nearly 100 senior citizens in the city. “We passed the word around through social media and WhatsApp. The response was phenomenal. Not only did we reach out to senior citizens from across the city, our number of volunteers grew as well,” Chatterjee said.The group now has around 190 volunteers, including medical professionals.“When we needed medicines, I tried contacting several pharmacies but none of them would deliver. We are too old to go out and buy things. My niece came to know about this volunteer group and contacted them. We got our medicines in an hour. I was so relieved,” said Bhattacharya, a resident of Survey Park. Volunteer Zeeshan Majeed, who runs NGO Anti Hunger Squad, delivered medicines to a blind senior citizen at Park Circus. “He had no one to help out during this time and reached out to us,” he said.An elderly couple living at Central Park in Jadavpur ran out of provisions and Dhar offered to buy the essentials for them. “I bought the stuff and then approached police for help with transport. They arranged an auto for me and I was able to deliver the goods,” Dhar said.That’s been the motto of Let’s Help so far. Members from different professions have joined the platform to reach out to their para people or the helpless.Mookerjee, who runs the Nanighar app that delivers home-cooked food, has been supplying meals to 12 senior citizens. “With household help not turning up, I am getting many calls from elderly couples for home-cooked food,” she said. “A couple of days ago, an-80-year-old contacted me asking for masks. After depositing her essentials, I also promised her home-made food.”The volunteers can be contacted at 8961907625 or md_nehal@ymail.com.",2020-01-04 21:15:00
2,Anasuya Basu,"Alzheimer’s, dementia patients hit hard - Telegraph India","The day-care centre of Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI) in Survey Park has been closed from March 17 because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.The inmates of the day-care centre, people with diminishing memory and resultant cognitive impairment, miss their daily visits to the centre from 10am to 4pm where they used to sing, participate in group activities, lunch and have tea with other inmates and caregivers, and play cognitive games.Their primary caregivers at home, in the meantime, used to get a seven-hour break from the rigours of caring for Alzheimer’s patients.“We had to stop our in-person services at the day-care centre because of the lockdown. But we are connecting with families over WhatsApp, on our helpline and social media page,” Nilanjana Maulik, secretary of ARDSI, Calcutta chapter, said.“The biggest problem we are facing is the psychological and emotional impact of the change in their daily routine and environment — both for the people with dementia and their caregiver/s. We are noticing some issues with anxiety and stress during this period.”Perhaps, it was this anxiety and stress that led the 91-year-old Alzheimer’s patient to wander out of his home in Entally a few days ago. He was found dead on the road, barely a kilometre from his home.The incident underlines the challenges of providing such patients with care in these times. “Most likely dementia does not increase risk for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, just like dementia does not increase the risk of flu. However, dementia-related behaviour and common health conditions that often accompany dementia may increase the risk,” according to the Alzheimer’s Association, US.During such prolonged lockdown there is definitely an increase in psychological stress on every human being, P.K. Pooviah, a geriatric specialist, said. “People with pre-existing memory problems and dementia will naturally be more vulnerable and disoriented in the current environment. Caregivers of patients with dementia, too, will be under extreme stress because of the stress of day-to-day living compounded by the fact they have to be on 24X7 call to care for the person with memory problems.”Under such challenging circumstances, it is important that caregivers have access to support to help them cope with the situation. The Bengal chapter of the Indian Association of Psychiatrists has set up a helpline, which works from 7am to 9pm, helping and counselling people. “Access to regular meals and having their basic physical needs met is critical to keep patients with dementia calm. Keeping a non-confrontational and calm environment at home is also critical,” Pooviah said.China, which was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak a few months ago, experienced the challenge of taking care of patients with dementia during the lockdown there. In a presentation by Huali Wang, executive vice-president of Alzheimer’s Disease China (ADC), the importance of the “continuum of dementia care” was stressed. “In order to continue giving care to Alzheimer’s patients, the family of the patient should be supported, the function of the community should be maximised and at the macro-level, different stakeholders should be involved.“Prolonged spells of lockdown and change in their routines will spark deep anxiety within them. In a therapy where interpersonal relationship, touch and feel of a loved and trusted person is a crucial factor in care, an impersonal ICU with nurses in Personal Protective Equipment will cause intense agitation in such patients.”",2020-01-04 21:15:00
5,Our Special Correspondent,Bursts of rain in parts of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Some parts of Calcutta and South 24-Parganas saw a brief windy spell with light rain on Wednesday evening.The pent-up heat on land and a high-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal led to the formation of rain-bearing clouds, a Met official said.The temperature had been more than 35 degrees Celsius, and the RealFeel a few notches more for the past few days. The brief spell of wind and rain would have been a welcome break for Calcuttans during any other year. But in times of lockdown because of the coronavirus, many Caluttans did not complain about the heat because of popular perception that the rising temperature might “kill” the virus.How the novel coronavirus reacts to a change in temperature is still unknown, though, and is being researched. The Celsius soared to 36.4 degrees on March 28 and has been hovering above 35 degrees for the past few days. On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was 37 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal.“The heat had been accumulating for a few days. A high-pressure zone over the Bay, aided by the heat, sent a lot of moisture into the land and led to formation of cumulonimbus clouds. The clouds floated towards south Bengal via East and West Midnapore and Jhargram,” G.K. Das, director, India Meteorological Department, Calcutta, said.The winds started blowing around 5.30pm, followed by light rain. The intensity was more in South 24-Parganas and on the city’s southern outksirts. The rain came in intermittent bursts.Joka and Behala received around 5mm of rain and Dhapa around 4mm till 8pm, according to the civic body’s weather tracking website.The weather will remain warm for the next few days, the Met office has said. “The maximum temperature is likely to be around 36 degrees Celsius,” a Met official said.",2020-01-04 21:16:00
6,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus caution: cops crack puja whip - Telegraph India,"Several Calcuttans on Wednesday organised Annapurna Puja attracting public gathering in pockets of the city, following which chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged people to restrict their pujas inside their homes. “Annapurna Pujo ache, hobe. Kintu bari-tei korun (Today is Annapurna Puja and it will be celebrated. But please do it at your home),” she said after reports of people celebrating in public emerged.Police said several pujas were organised inside homes on Wednesday but some were opened to public and prasad was distributed in violation of the lockdown norms. There were allegations that some of the traditional pujas across the city attracted crowds before the police intervened to disperse the gatherings. In at least one of the places, cops had to close the entrance to a building where the puja had been organised to stop people from entering.Some of the organisers said they had followed the social distancing rule. The police, though, said it was best to avoid any gathering that could be a potential trigger for the spread of the coronavirus.An official at Nabanna said the government would not allow any form of gathering — religious or otherwise — that could become a potential hotspot for the spread of the virus. “We are not in a position to take any more chances,” the official said.Senior officers at Lalbazar said the police acted on every complaint of public gathering and sent teams to check the veracity of each.“We understand the sentiments around puja or any other religious occasion. But this is not the time for emotions,” an officer said. “We are in a war-like situation where only saving lives will matter, nothing else.”More than a week into the lockdown, people are still stepping out of their homes for no apparent reason. The police on Wednesday arrested 48 people for violating the lockdown norms. The maximum number of violators was from the central division, while no cases were reported from the north division.",2020-01-04 21:19:00
8,Our Special Correspondent,"Promote students of classes IX, XI: CBSE - Telegraph India","The CBSE has advised schools to promote students of Classes IX and XI to the next year on the basis of school assessments or by giving them an opportunity to appear in online or offline tests.Those in Classes I to VIII may also be promoted to the next class, the board has said. The secretary of the Central Board of Secondary Education, Anurag Tripathi, issued a statement on Wednesday, which has also been posted on the board’s website and sent to the heads of schools.“...though several schools affiliated to CBSE have completed their examination, evaluation and promotion process for students who were studying in grades IX and XI in the 2019-20 academic session, there are several schools that have not been able to do so. This includes among others, Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas, State/ UT government schools, private schools, schools located in India and abroad, etc. All such schools are advised to promote students of grades IX and XI to the next grades on the basis of all the school based assessments including project work, periodic tests, term exams,etc, conducted so far,” the release says.“For any child who is unable to clear this internal process (in any number of subjects), the school may utilise this period for providing remedial interventions, and school may give the opportunity of appearing in school-based test/s online or offline. The promotion of such children may be decided on the basis of such tests.The board has said it is assessing the situation and is keen to “mitigate the anxiety of the students, parents, and schools”. Several CBSE schools in the city have already distributed e-report cards but a few are yet to conduct some exams.",2020-01-04 21:20:00
10,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus Outbreak: Isolation over, what now? - Telegraph India","At least some of the people who have completed their 14-day quarantine at home after returning from abroad are unsure about how to conduct themselves over the next few days, conversations with them revealed.Can they step out? Can they mingle with others or visit the market? Do they still have to be in touch with health officials? Many don’t seem to have answers to these questions.A 41-year-old woman from Salt Lake said she had not received any call from any government official since her home quarantine ended on Tuesday.She was not sure what to do and called up a Covid-19 helpline, mentioned on the website of the state health department, on Wednesday.“Health officials had earlier told me that the home quarantine was for 14 days. I wanted to be doubly sure whether I could enter the room where my son and husband have been staying over the past two weeks,” said the woman, who had returned from London in the middle of March.On calling the helpline, she was told that there was no bar on her meeting her son and husband since her quarantine period was over and she had not developed any Covid-19 symptom such as fever, cough or breathing trouble.Doctors have said these three are symptoms that should alert a person that he or she might have contracted SARS-CoV2, or the new coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The person who answered her call, however, did not tell her that she needed to call the helpline and alert the government if she developed any of the symptoms in the next 14 days.Asymptomatic persons who returned from abroad were required to undergo a 28-day home surveillance, split into two parts of 14-day each, an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said.In Calcutta, the civic body is entrusted with the responsibility of keeping tabs on people who have been asked to quarantine themselves at home after their return from abroad.The CMC official said a person was free to mingle with others in the family in the second phase — from the 15th day to the 28th day — but must not stop self-surveillance.“The first 14 days form the active surveillance period, during which we, from the government, call up the person every day and find out whether he or she has any of the Covid-19 symptoms — fever, cough or breathing trouble,” the official said.During the second phase, which is called passive surveillance, the person has to be under self-surveillance. “The second phase is as important as the first. It must be clearly explained to the person what he or she needs to do during the passive surveillance period. During the second phase, the person has to alert the health department via the helplines mentioned on the department’s website if he or she develops any Covid-19 symptom,” the official said.The Salt Lake woman, however, told Metro that the person who answered her call to the helpline did not tell her anything about passive surveillance. “The person who spoke to me said I could enter the room where my son and husband are staying wearing a mask,” she said. The guidelines for home quarantine issued by the Union health ministry does not say anything about how one should live after the first 14 days. A man in his 20s who had returned from Amsterdam, via Dubai, on March 16 had a better experience. “I received a call on the 15th day. They told me not to step out for another 14 days unless it is absolutely necessary. Even at home, they asked me to maintain social distancing with my family members,” said the resident of Topsia, who had spent the quarantine period alone, away from his family. He met his family members only on Wednesday.",2020-01-04 21:20:00

The colleges where online lessons have started have to submit a report mentioning details.Jaydeep Sarangi, the principal of New Alipore College, said the institution had been conducting online classes in English, math, anthropology, commerce, political science and philosophy since March 22.Siuli Sarkar, the principal of Lady Brabourne College, too, said online classes had started in many subjects.",2020-01-04 21:21:00

14,Subhajoy Roy,What to do when a patient tests positive for Covid-19 - Telegraph India,"Panic sets in at healthcare facilities every time a patient admitted for some other disease tests positive for Covid-19.The Union health ministry’s guidelines on what to do are clear, though.The guidelines state that once “a suspect/confirmed case is detected in a healthcare facility, standard procedure of rapid isolation, contact listing and tracking disinfection will follow with no need to shut down the whole facility”.Only in rare cases, it has suggested, a part of the facility can be shut down temporarily. Here is what the guidelines say:If a patient admitted for any other illness tests positive for Covid-19The guidelines also state that all hospitals should have a contingency plan so that the facilities do not shut down if a healthcare worker tests positive.It has been suggested that the employees split into groups and each takes turn in working for 14 days. That will help minimise the number of employees getting exposed to a healthcare worker or a patient testing positive.But there could be some situations where a hospital or portions of it may need to be shut down, the guidelines say. If despite taking all measures, reports of hospital-acquired Covid-19 cases continue to pour in, “it would be advisable to temporarily close the defined section of the health facility where the maximum number of hospital acquired infection (HAI) is being reported. After thorough cleaning and disinfection it can be put to use again”.The guidelines list preventive steps",2020-01-05 01:07:00
15,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Social-distancing economics worries bus owners - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has asked the district magistrates of seven districts that have been identified as Covid-19 green zones to make a realistic assessment of the bus routes where services can resume following all norms of social distancing.However, bus operators, reeling under mounting losses since the lockdown started, are not keen to resume services because lack of enough passengers would only burn a bigger hole in their pockets.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that each bus in the green zones would ferry no more than 20 passengers.Senior officials of the transport department on Thursday asked the seven district magistrates to meet bus operators in their districts, along with the superintendents of police, and draw up a list of feasible routes where a few buses may start plying.A number of bus operators flagged their concerns to transport department officials, saying running a bus now would mean paying from their pockets because not many people would step out amid the Covid-19 outbreak.They told the officials that they would rather want the government to run their buses after paying them enough for the upkeep of the vehicles.“Bus operators have said it is not feasible to run buses on all routes in a green-zone district because of lack of enough passengers. We have requested the district magistrates to identify the routes that can fetch the owners enough to recover the basic cost. The final order will be prepared based on the reports,” an official said.Around 600 buses ply in each of the seven green-zone districts — Alipurduar, North and South Dinajpur, Birbhum, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram.Bus fares in Bengal were last revised in 2018 and owners say they struggle to sustain the service.The lockdown has hit bus owners across the state hard. Most of them are finding it difficult to pay their EMIs and other expenses such as insurance.“The chief minister’s intention behind allowing buses to ply in green zones is no doubt great but it will not help us earn a living,” an owner said.“In most districts, we get the bulk of the passengers from railway stations, which are now closed. Schools, colleges and most offices are shut, too. There is no movement of buyers to the district headquarters from the interiors. What’s the point in running buses?” asked Tapan Bandopadhyay, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.“On an average, a bus owner has to earn at least Rs 1,700 a day to pay the EMI. If we are to run buses in this situation, we will end up paying from our pocket to run the service.”",2020-01-05 01:07:00
16,Sanjay Mandal,Surgery costs shoot up in Covid-19 battle - Telegraph India,"Officials and doctors of private hospitals have said the cost of treatment of patients undergoing surgeries has shot up by several thousands of rupees because of anti-Covid-19 precautionary measures.A private hospital has given its surgeons an estimate of the additional expense a patient has to bear. The estimate, one of the surgeons told Metro, includes Rs 5,000 for the Covid-19 test, another Rs 5,000 for personal protective equipment to be used at the operating theatre and the cost of additional two days’ stay at the hospital for the test.“The cost of treatment is going up by anything between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000,” the surgeon said.The state health department on Thursday issued a circular which stated that a patient without any symptom of Covid-19 “may be” tested for the disease before surgery if he or she was from any of the red zones.In Bengal, Calcutta, North-24 Parganas, Howrah and East Midnapore are the Covid-19 red zones.“Cases of planned surgery, if having symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 or is a close contact of a confirmed Covid-19 case, will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 before the surgery. Pre-surgery test may also be done if a case of planned surgery comes from a red zone for Covid-19,” the circular says.The World Health Organisation has said the official name for the virus responsible for Covid-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2“In case of emergency surgery, the surgical intervention may be undertaken with standard precaution for the surgery team. Sample for test of SARS-CoV-2 may be sent in accordance with the said criteria as above,” circular says.Although the tests have not been made mandatory, most private hospitals said they were doing pre-surgery tests even for people without symptoms because of safety reasons.Officials of some private hospitals raised concerns that it could lead to unfair practices.“There is an apprehension of overcharging or overuse of personal protective equipment. The government should issue a guideline on charges and use of PPE,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive officer of Peerless Hospital.Metro reported on Thursday that some private hospitals had been accused of overcharging patients for PPE. Few hospitals are apparently charging a patient the cost of 10 PPE daily on the ground that the housekeeping staff, too, need to wear the gear.“Initially, PPE was costly. But now many local manufacturing units are preparing the shields. There is no fixed maximum retail price for PPE as those are bought in bulk. So, there is no way for a patient to know the exact price of PPE,” the chief executive officer of a private hospital said.Some doctors, however, said patients were willing to pay the extra amount for PPE because they knew the shields were a must to protect them from the coronavirus.“My patients and their relatives are asking me whether my team members and I will be wearing PPE during a procedure. They don't mind paying the extra money, which should not be very high,” said interventional cardiologist Rabin Chakraborty.",2020-01-05 01:07:00

He reported the matter to the bank and lodged a police complaint on April 21.Officers of the anti-bank fraud section of Lalbazar intervened and Srikanta received a text message on April 28 that said the amount had been credited back to his account.“We never imagined it would be possible to get the money back.  It was such a relief to get it back. We cannot thank the police enough,” a member of the Das family said.Srikanta’s nephew, Pankaj, said the first call had come to the mobile phone number registered with the bank for the elderly aunt’s pension account at the Sashtitala branch of a nationalised bank.“The man who called had introduced himself as a ‘central officer’ and claimed to have specific information about the pension account. He knew that no money had been withdrawn from the account for three months,” Pankaj said. “My uncle spoke to the man and was duped into sharing the details of the ATM card for his salary account.”On sharing the card details, Srikanta received four OTPs on his phone, which he shared with the caller. Almost immediately, Rs 34,000 was withdrawn from his account on the pretext of transferring the amount to his aunt’s pension account.The call was disconnected and when Srikanta tried to call back on the number, a recorded message said the phone was switched off.",2020-01-05 01:08:00

Each kit also included two 100ml bottles of sanitiser and four washable cotton masks.The aid was organised by Alumnorum Societas (Alsoc), the St Xavier’s School Old Boys’ Association.The recipients were parents of children who study in the evening and night school run from the campus.“Our institution has a legacy of standing by the suffering.

We need to help those in need,” said Bishnu Jaiswal, coordinator of the old boys’ association.The beneficiaries included cobblers, plumbers and rickshaw-pullers.Volunteers had earmarked spots for each family representative.

The president of the order chairs the programme and a senior monk reads out historical proceedings of the General Body meeting of the Ramakrishna Mission Association, held on May 1 and 5, 1897,” said a senior monk.On May 1, 1897, Swami Vivekananda had convened a meeting of the devotees of Sri Ramakrishna at the house of Balaram Bose (a disciple of Sri Ramakrishna) in Bagbazar.Vivekananda had started the meeting saying a conviction “has grown in my mind after all my travels in various lands that no great cause can succeed without an organisation…. Let this association be named after him, in whose name, indeed, we have embraced the monastic life….”At the second meeting on May 5, 1897, the society was named “The Ramakrishna Mission”.Swami Vivekananda himself became the “general president” of Ramakrishna Mission. Some other office bearers were also chosen.",2020-01-05 01:08:00

Several residents gave her cakes and savouries to cheer her up,” Anirban Chowdhury, the association secretary, said.  The association called up the inspector-in-charge of Eco Park police station, Sushim Ganguly, after the student asked the association to help her reach home.She told Ganguly she was worried for her ailing grandmother and mother and that she felt depressed. “She kept crying… she is barely out of her teens… . she was surviving on instant noodles and meals provided by neighbours…. I then called up an officer of a police station in East Burdwan,” Ganguly said.The police station and the Bidhannagar commissionerate issued her a travel pass.The girl’s mother reached New Town in a car with a driver to pick her up, the police said.“I have received calls from students stuck in various states.

Our professors and deans are aware of the ground reality,” Basu told Metro on Thursday. “So, classes are being held offline and evaluation, too, will be held offline.”After going through the students’ feedback, the authorities realised that 45-50 per cent of its BTech and postgraduate students either don’t have a computer or live in places with poor Net connectivity.Final-year students will be graded on multiple assignments of design analysis sent through email as part of the final evaluation, director Basu said.A certain number of days will be assigned by which students will have to email their responses. If a student faces any difficulty in emailing, he/she can courier a hard copy to the institute.The class performance of students in the eighth semester will constitute a component of the assessment for the end-semester exams.The performance of students so far (till the seventh semester) will constitute another component of the assessment, an institute official said.The decision on exams is subject to the institute senate's approval, the official said. “The institute will decide later on the mode of assessment for second and third-year students.”The NIT is a central institute where half the students are from Bengal and the rest from across the country.Basu, a professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Kharagpur who is on lien to helm the Durgapur institute, had flagged his concern over last-mile connectivity and the resultant digital divide coming in the way of online classes in an article he had written for Metro on April 10.",2020-01-05 01:09:00

24,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus lockdown: 400km, with insect in kid’s airway - Telegraph India","A 18-month-old boy with an insect stuck in his respiratory tract had to travel nearly 400km from South Dinajpur to Calcutta amidst the lockdown to get it extracted after being referred by two government hospitals and allegedly refused admission in as many nursing homes.Doctors at SSKM Hospital, where the insect was taken out, said Sampreet Ghosh had developed pneumonia because of an infection caused by the presence of a foreign object in the respiratory tract for nearly three days. He is now admitted in the paediatric critical care unit of the hospital.The referral and alleged refusal happened days after Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had said on April 24 that private and government hospitals should not deny treatment to patients.One of the two hospitals that could not treat the child was the Malda Medical College and Hospital.Sampreet’s father Suman said the insect had entered the child’s mouth when he was playing on the terrace of their house on April 26 afternoon.“We are not sure whether he had swallowed the insect or it somehow entered his respiratory tract. He came down and was shaking, unable to breathe. His face was turning black,” recounted Suman, a schoolteacher.Suman drove Sampreet to the nearby Gangarampur Sub-divisional Hospital in South Dinajpur. The hospital authorities said they could not treat the boy and referred him to the Malda Medical College and Hospital, about 60km away (see chart). The boy was admitted to the medical college the same night.“Doctors examined him but found nothing. He was vomiting and a small portion of the insect came out. ENT specialists at the hospital then examined him and said a big portion of the insect might still be stuck in the respiratory tract and that was causing the distress,” Suman said.“The doctors referred my son to SSKM Hospital because they said he needed to undergo a procedure that could not be performed at the medical college. Sampreet was at the Malda medical college for two days. During that period, I called up two nursing homes, requesting them to admit my son. Both refused, saying they were not admitting patients because of the Covid-19 outbreak,” Suman alleged.The family left Malda for Calcutta on the night of April 28.“We had first thought of hiring an ambulance. But later I decided to drive to Calcutta in my car because of the Covid-19 fear. We reached Calcutta the next day after a 10-hour journey,” Suman said.“We didn't face any problem on the road and fuel stations were open, too.”At SSKM, Sampreet underwent bronchoscopy, a procedure that allows doctors to access the lungs and air passages for examination and therapeutic purposes. A thin tube or bronchoscope is passed through the nose or mouth, down to the throat and into the lungs.“Whatever was left of the insect was taken out but because it had stayed in the respiratory tract for long, an infection developed and that led to pneumonia,” said Ankit Choudhary, an ENT surgeon at SSKM Hospital, who along with a team of doctors and anaesthetists performed the procedure.In the Covid-19 season, many doctors are refusing to examine respiratory tracts of patients.“In case of children, it’s more risky because of their tendency to cough in such situations. We were wearing personal protective equipment to perform the procedure. It is risky for anaesthetists, too,” said Choudhary.Suman said they failed to find any place to stay in Calcutta because of the lockdown. He and brother-in-law Bhanu are spending the nights in the car. The ENT department has allowed his wife and mother to stay in the paediatric ward.“Most beds are now vacant. So, we are allowing parents to stay here because the shelter for patients’ relatives is full,” said Choudhary.Metro had on April 10 reported how a 16-month-old boy with a bone stuck in his respiratory tract had to travel almost 300km from Pakur in Jharkhand to SSKM Hospital to get it extracted.“We have opened medical colleges and superspeciality hospitals in the districts but some crucial departments are not functional. Trained manpower is not available,” said a health department official.Officials at the Malda Medical College and Hospital said they did not have the expertise to perform paediatric bronchoscopy.“It is a specialised skill which we lack. So, we referred the patient to SSKM,” said Amit Dan, the medical superintendent-cum-vice-principal of the hospital.The hospital at Gangarampur could not be contacted for comment.Officials at Dishari Health Point, one of the two nursing homes that allegedly refused to admit Sampreet, said ENT doctors were not examining patients because of Covid-19.“We are not turning away patients. But ENT doctors have not been available since the lockdown started. So, we can’t admit these patients,” said S.N. Sharma, the director of the nursing home.",2020-01-05 01:09:00
25,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus in West Bengal: More shops open under police vigil - Telegraph India,"Following last Friday’s orders from the government allowing standalone shops to open despite the lockdown, some shops across the township have started lifting shutters. However a few of these drew such thick crowds that police had to rush to shut them down.Needs, a Baisakhi shop that sells beauty products as well as stationeries, had opened on Sunday morning and was swarmed by delighted shoppers. “There were queues of at least 10 people outside the shop. Many were asking for hair dye,” said a lady who joined the queue to buy cream. “I left soon afterwards but passers-by said that cops came and shut them down as they was drawing too much crowd. I’ve heard the shop will open once in a few days from now on.”An officer of the Bidhannagar Commissionerate confirmed that they were not allowing crowds to gather in front of shops. “Police personnel have been posted at markets to ensure people follow social distancing protocol. And if we see that crowds are gathering regularly in front of a shop without any regard to norms we are asking the owners to shut them down,” said the officer.  In EE Block, an outlet of a coffee retail chain has re-opened. “But people cannot come here and have coffee. We are serving customers in disposable cups and trays and are requesting them to go home and have them. We are following all precautions in our service zone as well as kitchen,” said an employee.A snack shop, Anjali Zenith, has opened in IA Block opposite the stadium. “The lockdown has hit my business hard,” said owner Aparna Ghosh. “We were not prepared and had a large quantity of ice cream in the shop. Part of it has melted and the ice-cream companies won’t take it back. I’m also having to pay an extra per cent of the order value to suppliers so they deliver goods during the lockdown. But I’m happy that we’re getting a steady stream of customers since we opened on Sunday.”A stationery shop that has opened in Purbachal market is doing brisk business selling notebooks, colouring books, crayons, pens and refills. “Customers are buying five or 10 notebooks at a time and I don’t blame them,” says proprietor Goutam Ghosh. “I’ve opened my store but can only sell till stocks last.”Before the lockdown Ghosh would have inventory replenished by suppliers every day and since suppliers have not been allowed to operate post lockdown, he says supplies are running out fast. “At the rate at which parents are buying in bulk, I’ll be sold out in a week!” he says.Additional reporting by Debasmita Bhattacharjee ",2020-01-05 07:20:00

In the hours in between, he has been delivering medicines to senior citizens, doing their shopping and running their errands, without charging a penny.Das runs a newspaper delivery agency from 4am to 8am in the morning. After that, he used to work at a clothes shop in Shyambazar till the lockdown shut it down. “Now I sit on the footpath opposite IA Market and sell milk, bread, butter and paneer,” says Das, who is better known as Nitai in the neighbourhood.Due to his newspaper delivery business, residents know him personally. “I’ve been in this field for 19 years and I’m glad that at this time of need, customers, especially senior citizens living alone, are treating me as their own and asking me to help out,” he says.Residents are handing over shopping lists and medicine lists for him to fetch after his work. “A retired doctor is even handing me food and supplies to deliver to her daughter’s flat near NRS hospital (Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital), where she too is a doctor,” says the man who is gladly zipping across on his bike to run the errands.Das lives in Lake Town and is worried about paying his rent and buying necessities for his own family. “My biggest worry is my cancer-stricken mother-in-law who lives near Nabadwip.

The Korean Association of Kolkata, with its head quarters in CJ Block, has raised Rs 3 lakh that they used to buy food and distribute in seven areas in and around the city.Set up in the early 2000s, the association has nearly 100 member families that helped raise the funds. “But due to social distancing protocols, very few of us went over to distribute the rice, pulses, biscuits etc,” said president of the body, Daehun Moon. They held the relief camps at Ultadanga, Sealdah, Dhapa, Bashirhat, Jodthbhim in Rajarhat, Paschim Chowbaga near Science City and a centre for the homeless in Beliaghata.The final leg was on Monday, at Dhapa, where they handed over 2,500kg of grains to 500 migrant workers. “We identified the seven spots based on reports from the news, friends and our own members who have business there,” said Moon. “In each place, we contacted local leaders who helped us with the distribution.”  For group secretary Seong Kuk Jeong, this was the first time he visited these areas but he received positive vibes from the residents. “We spoke to them a little, in a mixture of Bangla, Hindi and English. I asked them “Bhalo achho?” and they replied “Bhalo achhi,” smiles Jeong, who runs a taekwondo training centre in CJ Block.When Covid-19 broke out, some member families returned to their motherland. “Korea is handling the crisis well but still, as residents of Calcutta, we wanted to help out here.

29,Souvik Das,Satyajit Ray birth centenary quiz - Telegraph India,"Ahead of Satyajit Ray’s birth centenary on Saturday, Souvik Das, locked down at home away from his Sector V office, turns quiz master to test your Ray quotient1. This movie of Satyajit Ray about the garden of Indra displayed the garden’s evident wealth disparity. In a sequence, the film cuts synchronously between shots of the royal guests indulging themselves and poor locals enjoying a meagre feast of rice and pork on the streets. This landed the film in a controversy that continued for decades.2. Satyajit Ray is renowned for the design of the covers of various books and magazines. One of his earliest ventures into this passion was for a book on history which was written from the viewpoint of a freedom-fighter, and is concerned more with the philosophical and spiritual underpinnings of Indian culture than with recounting a historical narrative. Which book are we talking about?3. A proper noun connects Satyajit Ray, a mythological character who invented bucolic poetry and a tiny inner Saturnian moon. Name it.4. Who connects Satyajit Ray, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Dev Anand, Geeta Bali?5. This cinema directed by one of the legendary directors of our times received some not-so-kind comments from Ray, who wrote about the movie “a delectable heroine, an ear-filling background score, and a simple, wholesome wish-fulfiling screen story (summary in seven words: Big Bad Bureaucrat Reformed by Rustic Belle) … essentially old-fashioned and Indian beneath its trendy habit.”6. Conversation circa 1960 depicts two figures seated on stools, their bodies facing in opposite directions. The figure on the left has its torso and head turned to face the other person, suggesting the movement of twisting around while engaged in conversation. Who created this paper collage?7. What connects Umrao Jaan by Muzaffar Ali, 36 Chowringhee Lane by Aparna Sen, Jangal Mein Mangal by Rajendra Bhatia and Balika Badhu by Tarun Majumdar?Focus on supporting actsStarting from Chunibala Devi in Pather Panchali, movies of Satyajit Ray saw some stellar performance in supporting roles. In fact, Victor Banerjee was the first ever recipient of the Rajat Kamal Award for the Best Supporting Actor for his role in Ray’s Ghare Baire. Take a look at the movie stills below and identify the lesser-known faces who played pivotal characters in these movies.SpotlIght on propsProps in cinemas enhance the narrative, conveys a circumstance and makes characters instantly recognisable. Satyajit Ray used props in the most amazing ways in his movies. He was always flexible about letting actors add their touch to a scene. One story goes like this — while researching his part as General Outram, Richard Attenborough found that the man smoked cheroots and wore a pince-nez. He thus not only began practising a Scottish accent but also brought the props with him. In the following visual clues, some of the most important props used in Satyajit Ray films are shown.Who wrote this letter which turned the world of the reader upside down in this movie?The plank of wood called pniri is a symbol of matrimony in Bengal. For whom is this wooden plank (pniri) getting decorated?This single shot pistol was slowly getting obsolete during the years this film tries to portray. The more sophisticated ones were becoming more popular. In this shot who is aiming this pistol at whom?In this book, Alan Isaacs sees religious faith as a private necessity for many: for society as a whole, even in the nuclear age, he acknowledges that the concept of God may serve a useful function in the enforcement of moral codes. To whom does this book belong in this film?When the cigarette was perhaps more harmful than the smoke... Who did the cigarette belong to before being burnt to ashes in this scene?This movie comprises a series of prophetic nightmares, ominous daydreams and memories less about people and more about birds. In this iconic scene, what are these skeletons waiting for? Whoever said that we are the sum total of our experiences and not of our possessions, has undermined how our possessions sometimes let the cat out of the bag. Ray’s use of this screwdriver to put this movie en route the climax has been nothing short of a masterstroke. Who was the owner of this screwdriver before this scene?Mail your answers to saltlake@abpmail.com by May 5, 2020.

30,Monalisa Chaudhuri,‘Drunken spin’ in Audi Q7 during coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"Three businessmen on a joyride in an Audi Q7 in violation of the lockdown were arrested in an inebriated state at the crossing of Russell Street and Middleton Row around Thursday midnight, police said. “One of the drunk businessmen was at the wheel. After the car was intercepted, they falsely claimed that they could not be arrested because they were travelling in a vehicle that belonged to a foreign consulate,” an officer said.Officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station on Friday checked with the consulate and found that the vehicle was indeed hired by it with a specific number-plate. The contract expired last year.“The car, however, continued to ply illegally with the registration plate that was issued when it was in the service of the consulate. The car has been seized,” the officer said.The three men — their identities are being withheld because The Telegraph could not obtain their families’ reaction to the allegations —  have been arrested on charges of drink driving, cheating, forgery and violation of the lockdown. “All three are residents of the Theatre Road area and were on a joyride. They were intoxicated and abusing officers on naka duty,” the officer said.The businessmen have been remanded in police custody for four days.Sources said the police searched their homes and found documents related to the car and the original registration number plate. “Our officers are literally spending sleepless nights to ensure that people remain indoors. Such incidents are demoralising and uncalled for. Some people are not taking the lockdown seriously, at their peril as well as that of others,” the officer said.",2020-01-05 19:25:00

Almost 10 per cent of the marks have not been submitted by examiners till now, Kalyanmoy Ganguly, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said on Monday.The board had sent the instruction to examiners on Sunday.The board has set mid-July as the target to announce the Madhyamik results, Ganguly said. “We need to complete the process of collecting the marks at the earliest. We will take four to six weeks to prepare the results after getting all the marks. Students are anxiously waiting for their results.”The Madhyamik exams were held in February and the results were supposed to be declared between the second and third week of May.When the Centre announced the lockdown on March 23, close to 13 per cent of the total marks had reached the board.Arranging transport to submit the marks to head examiners is the responsibility of examiners.Since movement of vehicles was restricted during the lockdown, the marks submission process had to be stopped.Examiners were asked to start submitting marks again from May 1.On May 31, the board found that more than 700,000 marks were still to reach the board.Transport queriesThe first working day at regional transport offices across Calcutta since the lockdown started saw officials answer countless queries from worried citizens.The questions included whether one had to pay a fine for not renewing driving licence and whether one could apply for change of ownership of car online.Offices in Beltala, Salt Lake, Kasba and Behala, Alipore, Howrah and Barasat opened their doors on Monday, for the first time since the lockdown had started.

33,Debraj Mitra,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 12 days on, a messy maze at Jodhpur Park - Telegraph India","Among thousands of trees felled by Cyclone Amphan was a peepal tree that stood in a bylane in Jodhpur Park. Almost a fortnight after the storm, the tree and a tilted electric pole with wires dangling from it are still blocking the stretch.Residents of the neighbourhood said they had been caught in a tug-of-war between CESC and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Several complaints to both organisations have failed to elicit a response, alleged the residents.The stretch in question is a bylane off Gariahat Road South, right next to a children’s park and a five minutes’ walk from the Jodhpur Park sub-post office. When Metro visited the spot on Monday afternoon, police guardrails and a cycle-van cordoned off the stretch. Remains of the tree were still there, as was the tilted post. The post rested on the roof of a shop, a mesh of wires dangling from it.A CESC official, to whom this newspaper had sent pictures of the blocked stretch, said “a team would reach the area as soon as possible”.But residents said their pleas were unanswered. “I have sent at least 10 WhatsApp messages to the mayor. But there has been no response from the CMC,” said a resident, a teacher. His house stands on the same stretch. “Forget cars, it is risky for human beings to pass through the stretch,” he said.An octogenarian resident said he had lodged multiple complaints with CESC. “But they have been saying one thing — CMC has to remove the tree before they can fix the pole,” he said.The residents pointed out that the stretch was home to many senior citizens. “If there is a medical emergency, it will be impossible to get an ambulance here,” said one of them.Power was restored to the area within 36 hours of the storm, the residents said.In the aftermath of the cyclone, thousands of trees and electric poles were uprooted. Many Calcuttans complained of being caught in a tug-of-war between CESC and the CMC in removing trees, poles and other obstacles from the road.Some of the residents said the stretch deserved better attention because Ratan Dey, the mayoral council member in charge of roads and the local councillor, lives there.“The tree has been deliberately kept there to block the road, to save people from the dangling wires. I have cleared fallen trees and branches in entire Jodhpur Park within May 25. Why would I not do the same right next to my house? It is CESC’s responsibility to remove the pole,” Dey told this newspaper.He also said the wires dangling from the pole could pose “a serious threat to civic workers”. “The cables (hanging from the pole) are insulated,” the CESC official said.",2020-01-06 20:36:00

Some also deliver ration to the families of these children who have had no income during the lockdown.Each of these students has been assigned certain days of the week to hold classes over the phone and some days to take oral tests on the portions taught. The children (more than 50) are mostly from Classes V to VIII and some in Class IX.“We have selected academically bright students and the more responsible ones to hold the classes so that the children can benefit and continue with their studies,” founder Tanmoy Patra said. “If not for such an effort on their part, many of the children would have given up. It would have undone all that has been done in the past few years.”Most of the parents of the children are daily labourers; some pick flowers, while some work in hotels in the city and some work on farms.Most are first-generation learners who went to government schools. “I conduct the classes and take tests, otherwise they will not study. If we leave them to study on their own, some will not even touch books. We, as seniors, have to ensure they continue with their studies,” Keya Pal, 17, said.She has her own share of worries — two Higher Secondary papers remaining pending and her father’s income fast drying up. “Only after the exams will we get the results and then take admission to a college. The lockdown has dried up our family income… it will not be easy.”Another student, Sagar Pal, has been conducting science classes. Cyclone Amphan damaged his father’s crop but he still has been teaching and distributing ration for the past two months.“These children are in the same space as us… while we have been able to get some direction they have to be guided. If I can do something as a senior why not. It’s not that I am teaching them every day…. I have time for myself and my studies as well,” Sagar said.",2020-01-06 20:44:00
36,Kinsuk Basu, Coronavirus Lockdown: Agonising wait for buses in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Commuters across the city on Monday had to put up with an agonising wait at bus stops as most private buses stayed off the roads and the ones run by the government had all seats occupied.Autorickshaws — only two passengers are allowed in each — often proved a costly alternative for many. At some places, taxi drivers switched to “shuttle mode”, often carrying three passengers for a price.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on May 29 that buses, private and government-owned, would ply from June 1 and be allowed to ferry as many passengers as the number of seats. No one will be allowed to stand.Commuters from across the city said they had to wait at bus stops for long periods, wondering whether they would at all reach their destinations, as the government buses that came had no vacant seat left.At several key pockets such as Esplanade, Shyambazar, Ruby and Maniktala, anxious commuters were seen waiting for buses till late in the evening.Every time a bus arrived, passengers ran desperately to board it. On most occasions, the conductor would prevent them from boarding as all seats were occupied.“I have been waiting for almost 20 minutes and not a single government bus stopped,” Gopal Chandra Ghosh said while waiting at a bus stop on SP Mukherjee Road around 11am. “My employer has opened his shop at New Market. I don’t know how to reach there.”Unable to board buses, many wondered whether it was the right decision to step out.“I have to buy some fittings for my bathroom from a shop on Rashbehari Avenue and it’s urgent. The government buses are full and autorickshaws are charging Rs 20 till Gariahat,” said Gaurav Sen, a resident of Narkelbagan in Kasba. A little past noon, Sen said he would have possibly done better if he had stepped out earlier.Along most thoroughfares, including Beleghata Main Road, Narkeldanga Main Road, APC Road and RG Kar Road in the north, and AJC Bose Road, Diamond Harbour Road and Rashbehari Avenue in the south, waiting commuters had to hear “hoye gyachhey hoye gyachhey” from the drivers, as they drove through.The transport department ran more than 400 buses on 40 routes in Calcutta and its adjoining areas, including parts of Shakuntala Park in Behala, Kamalgazi in Garia, Dunlop, Ariadaha and New Town, between 7am and 7pm.“We tried to reduce the gap between two buses on a route to 20 minutes,” a transport department official said. “But since passengers are not allowed to stand, demand far outstrips supply.”Around 9,000 private buses operate in and around Calcutta, comprising nearly 65 per cent of the buses in the city. On Monday, a handful of private buses came out but that hardly made any difference.“We wanted to check the number of passengers willing to take a bus ride seating side by side,” said Rahul Chatterjee of Bus Minibus Samanoy Samity. “The response was not very encouraging.”",2020-01-06 20:51:00
37,Kinsuk Basu," Coronavirus Lockdown: Most stalls shut across Kolkata, cops ready code - Telegraph India","Hawkers in Gariahat were a divided lot — only around 45 of them reopened their stalls on Monday as police failed to issue clear orders on whether they could carry on with their businesses.Scenes were no different across parts of New Market, Burrabazar, Posta, Brabourne Road and Bidhan Sarani. Only a few hawkers reopened their stores.On May 18, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said hawkers would be able to reopen their stalls on May 27 but suggested that they adopt the odd-even formula. The stalls with odd numbers and the ones with even numbers will open on alternate days to ensure social distancing.The Telegraph had on May 27 reported that more than half the stalls in Gariahat had not yet been numbered.On Monday, police said a list of hawkers in and around Gariahat had been drawn up. A team has been set up to verify every day whether the odd-even formula is being followed.“But this exercise will begin only after we have received a formal clearance from the police headquarters that hawkers could reopen their stalls,” said a senior police officer at Gariahat police station.The city has about 2.75 lakh roadside stalls. Union leaders said there were about 5,000 hawkers in and around Gariahat — between Ballygunge and Deshapriya Park and Golpark and Pantaloons. In the Hatibagan area, the count stands at 2,500 — between Star theatre and Shyambazar, along Bidhan Sarani.“We met police officers and asked them why our brothers can’t open their stalls from Monday?” asked Debraj Ghosh, a hawker union leader in Gariahat. “They asked us to wait for a few more days.”Outside New Market, only a few hawkers opened their stalls. The majority of the hawkers in the central Calcutta pocket turned up early  but finally decided against opening their stalls.Some of the hawkers said officers from New Market police station had asked them to wait for a few more days before resuming their business.“Footfall has come down drastically and hawkers have been the worst hit. If the government can’t decide when to allow hawkers to operate, let it transfer a small amount to their bank accounts,” said Shaktiman Ghosh, a leader of Hawker Sangram Committee. Senior officers at the city police headquarters in Lalbazar said final touches were being given to a uniform code on how to ensure social distancing once hawkers are allowed to operate across Calcutta. This will be passed on to all police stations so that officers know how to enforce it.“We hope that by June 8, a clear set of instructions will be ready and hawkers will be allowed to run their businesses,” said a senior police officer at Lalbazar.",2020-01-06 21:01:00
38,Debraj Mitra, Coronavirus Lockdown: Shops reopen with low footfall - Telegraph India,"Stores have started reopening their doors after remaining shut for over two months. Their back pushed to the wall, the owners and staff have chosen to live with the virus over living with zero income. For some, that means cycling over 20km to work. For others, waiting for an hour to board an auto. But business must start, said the shop owners and their staff when The Telegraph visited them on Monday afternoon.Stone in riceSai Guin Emporium, a store on Rashbehari Avenue selling kitchen appliances, opened full day for the first time since March 22. Last week, the store had opened a couple of times, but mainly for cleaning and sorting stuff that had not been touched for two months.“A water filter and some filter accessories have been the only things I managed to sell so far,” owner Tarun Kanti Guin said around 2pm.The store opened around 10.30am. Guin has two employees. One of them, Ranjan Dey, was having lunch when this newspaper visited the shop. A stone hidden inside a morsel of rice got stuck inside his mouth for a while. “I have been forced to eat rice procured from the ration store. I was never rich but this is a first for my family — biting a stone in rice every now and then,” said Dey.Less than 200m away, Suparna, a standalone sari store, was empty. “The slump had started with demonetisation. Then came GST. Covid-19 came like the knockout punch,” said Debatosh Saha, the co-owner of the store.“People are only keen on saving for a more uncertain future. Education and medical expenses are unavoidable but apart from that, people are not willing to spend. This was before the impact of the novel coronavirus. You do the math on what happened because of the lockdown,” Saha said with a wry smile.On guardGariahat had several shops that were open. But many more were shut.Traders Assembly, the apparel shop right at the crossing, re-opened its doors on Monday. It had remained shut since March 19, an employee said. A handful of employees were seated but there were no customers.“Bouni hoeni ekhono (We are yet to sell anything today),” said Joydeb Nag, who supervises operations. A machine dispensing a liquid handwash stood at the entrance. Handwash done, a thermal gun test for body temperature awaits visitors.Prabir Mondal, 19, another worker at the store, had come cycling from Subhasgram in South 24-Parganas, over 20km from Gariahat. “I started around 9am. I reached here by 10.15am,” said Mondal.ShoppersCamac Street looked busier than Gariahat on Monday. The shops were open and some had shoppers, too. Like the outlet of a Bangalore-based footwear brand. Tasmiya Naaz and Rehan Ansari, cousins from Garden Reach, had just bought a wallet from the store. “It is an anniversary gift for my father,” said Tasmiya, a final-year BCom student. “Life has become so stifling. We wanted some fresh air and uncle and aunty’s anniversary gave me an opportunity to go out,” said Ansari, who is pursuing an interior designing course. The store, open for a week now, has four employees. The youngest of them Subhadip Saha, 25, came from Liluah. He got a drop till Howrah on a bike. From Howrah to Camac Street, it is usually a walk. “I get a bus if I am lucky,” said Saha.",2020-01-06 21:16:00
39,Subhankar Chowdhury," Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 250 IIEST trees fall, 50 can be saved - Telegraph India","Cyclone Amphan uprooted more than 250 trees on the IIEST Shibpur campus but about a fifth can be saved, a group of horticulturists said after inspecting the damage on Monday.An official of the institute said some of the uprooted trees were more than 150 years old. The land where the institute stands was allotted in 1820.The Botanic Garden authorities had allocated almost 21 acres on its southeast corner to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel. This had led to the birth of Bishop’s College. The institute was established in 1856.Calcutta Civil Engineering College, which was set up at the Writers’ Buildings in 1856 after some years at the erstwhile Presidency College, came to the present campus as The Government College, Howrah, in 1880. Subsequently more land was acquired, enabling the campus to grow across 121 acres.Bishop’s College had shifted to Calcutta.“So some of the trees are as old as 200 years. The East India Company had planted sal and teak trees apart from banyan, mahogany, walnut, peepal, gulmohar, and copper pot for ships that were then made of wood. Since it was expensive to get wood from Rangoon, the trees were planted,” the institute official said.While trees have fallen across the campus, those close to the Hooghly riverbank have been battered the most, another official said. “The two giant mahogany trees that adjoin the Oval stadium have fallen.”IIEST director Parthsarathi Chakrabarty had called the team of the horticulturists to explore the possibilities of saving trees on the campus that has more than 4,000 trees.Trees that were uprooted with a considerable chunk of soil attached to the roots and have remained so for the past 12 days are easier to restore, according to the team.D.T. Bhutia, a member of the team said they had advised the institute some immediate measures to revive the fallen trees. “The institute must cover exposed roots by hessian cloth and keep watering them. There should be heavy pruning of branches but care must be taken to leave some branches with leaves to sustain the basic needs of trees.”The remaining part of the roots will have to be protected and watered as the branches draw water from the roots to prepare food. “Hessian cloth, along with watering, will help in moisturising the exposed roots and help in transpiration loss,” Bhutia, who is also the assistant director of the CPWD horticulture wing, said.Tapas Roy, the officiating superintendent engineer of the institute who accompanied the team, said they would start covering and watering the roots from Tuesday.“All operations like straightening the trees and preparing pits have to be done with the help of hydraulic cranes and excavators under supervision,” Roy said.Director Chakrabarty said the team had said some of the trees were still drawing nutrition from the soil attached to the roots. “If we take care of them, many of the trees will survive”.",2020-01-06 21:33:00
40,Snehal Sengupta, Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: NDRF drains water from Mahestala pocket - Telegraph India,"A team from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) on Monday drained out water from a Mahestala area, which was waterlogged after Cyclone Amphan had struck the city on May 21.After draining out the water using portable pumps, the team surveyed the area. “There were several uprooted trees and a mesh of cables and wires on the roads,” an NDRF officer said.The men in orange overalls used chainsaws to slice the branches and trunks of the trees.Prabir Kumar De, 66, said no official from Mahestala Municipality had visited the area since it got waterlogged.He and his wife had kept all their windows shut because of the stench from the stagnant water and to keep mosquitoes at bay, and were also praying for sunny days for faster evaporation of water.“We had tried hiring plumbers who could bring in pumps to drain out the water but they refused because of the stench. Finally, the NDRF team came to our rescue,” said De.The affected area, where around 200 families live, is in ward 9 of Maheshtala Municipality. A civic official said they did not have the specialised equipment that the NDRF team brought in.“They lopped off the branches and sliced through the trunks in minutes using their saws,” the official said.The residents, happy that water had finally receded, offered the NDRF men tea and biscuits. Shyamal Biswas, another resident, said they had even offered to cook them a lunch of fish curry and rice but they politely refused. ",2020-01-06 21:34:00
41,Monalisa Chaudhuri And Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus lockdown: Domestic help in unfamiliar space - Telegraph India,"Domestic workers, who keep many a home running in the country, have entered uncharted territory with the phased easing of the lockdown.At least one complex in Calcutta has told residents not to share domestic help, which has prompted some to put in place 12-hour shifts that entail higher pay.The directive not to share help is prompted by the need to minimise the chance of wider transmission of the coronavirus by one possible asymptomatic carrier to multiple households in the complex.However, probably unwittingly, the order also shakes up the Indian household economics that is not always viewed as a model of equity in spite of offering some advantages to both sides.On one hand, the sharing of hands allows domestic workers to earn more; on the other, it makes the services affordable for the employer. But a view also exists that the remuneration has been kept low for the unorganised sector with little bargaining power.When the lockdown was announced, several housing complexes had banned domestic help from turning up for work.However, with Unlock 1 debuting on Monday and several older residents complaining of hardship, some of the complexes have started allowing domestic workers to return.“Our society has allowed 12-hour shifts for domestic help from today after a lot of protests from residents (against the bar on their entry) on WhatsApp groups. Several elderly residents were suffering a lot,” said a resident of Urbana, off EM Bypass. An advisory circulated among the residents says: “Only one domestic help per house. Such help will not be shared between residents.”A few residents said they would pay more for the longer shifts but it is not clear whether that would make up for the domestic worker’s lost income from other homes.The decision to reinstate domestic hands was taken after a poll in which 60 per cent voted in favour, sources said. Basic safety measures like wearing masks, washing hands and feet at the time of entry and the use of sanitisers are in place.In addition, forms have been circulated among residents for the declaration of details of the domestic help, which will be sent to the local police station.The residents’ welfare association (RWA) in Gariahat’s Fort Terrazzo has handed to all residents a form to declare that the help is not coming from a “red containment zone”. Residents have the responsibility to inform the health department and the local police station if the domestic worker or any other domestic service provider falls ill.A washbasin has been installed at the entrance to ensure all service providers wash their hands with soap before entering the complex.At Uniworld City, domestic help have been allowed four days a week, and only one at a flat, till June 7. Thereafter, they can turn up for work seven days a week.Avishikta-I and II, Greenwood Nook and Ruchira Residency on EM Bypass have also been allowing domestic workers in from Monday.Residents were asked to give a written undertaking citing the details of the help who would enter the housing. Avishikta I insisted on only one help per household.NewspapersAfter a gap of more than two months, several complexes allowed doorstep delivery of newspapers from Monday. With lockdown norms being eased across India, some associations have revised their “entry rules”, with one society advising that the newspapers be “ironed”.Urbana has yet to allow doorstep delivery of newspapers. From Tuesday, newspapers will have to be collected from the ground-floor lobby. Until Monday, they had to be collected from a place near the clubhouse.At Upohar: The Condoville and South City complex, both the entry of maids and doorstep delivery of newspapers started from Monday. “It’s a welcome respite. I got the newspaper at my doorstep today. To go down every morning just to collect the newspaper, come back and undergo the complete sanitisation process that I follow every time I go out has been exhausting,” said an Upohar resident.At South City, an elderly resident said: “All these days, it was practically not possible for me to go down every day and collect my newspaper. My children did not want me to step out.”He added that some of his neighbours would get the newspaper and then leave it like that for several hours and read it in the evening. “I know some who are even microwaving it,” he said.As early as on March 23, the International News Media Association (INMA) had said, citing health agencies and medical experts, that there is no record or any evidence for the coronavirus being transmitted through print newspaper, magazine, letter or package.All scientific evidence suggests that porous paper surfaces that include newsprint are safe from the coronavirus, Earl Wilkinson, INMA’s executive director and chief executive officer had said in a blog that refers to research studies and health agency guidance.Doorstep delivery started at South City from Monday with an advisory “to either use hot iron on the newspaper or leave it under the sun for 30minutes to kill any contaminants”.The residents’ welfare associations at most New Town housing complexes — Rosedale Garden, Bengal DCL and Anahita, for instance — began allowing the entry of domestic workers and doorstep delivery of milk and newspapers from Monday. At Rosedale Garden near Karigari Bhavan in Action Area III, separate lifts have been earmarked for visitors and residents. RWAs have framed diverse standard operating procedures during the lockdown, often raising the question whether they were entitled to take such decisions and impose restrictions on residents.Lawyer Anirban Guha Thakurta said: “Any action by anybody cannot hinder the fundamental right to life as guaranteed by the Constitution. Sometimes, the restrictions being forced on residents could be a greater threat to life, especially for the elderly, than the lack of them.”Another lawyer, Saumyajit Raha, said most of the RWAs were not registered under the Apartment Ownership Act and acted within the framework of “by-laws” that they themselves had often framed at meetings held without quorum.“But as they are elected representatives in most of the cases, they have the majority mandate to implement their decisions,” Raha said.",2020-01-06 23:52:00
42,Mita Mukherjee,College exams from October 1 to 18 - Telegraph India,"The state-aided universities will have to conduct the final-year undergraduate and postgraduate exams between October 1 and 18 and the results will have to be declared by October 31, the Bengal government has said.Each university has to decide whether the exams will be held in the pen-and-paper or online mode or a mix of the two.The decisions were taken at a virtual meeting education minister Partha Chatterjee held with the vice-chancellors of all state-aided universities on Monday.“The minister said that if a test is held online, the university concerned has to ensure that not a single student fails to write a paper because of lack of infrastructure or a smart device,” a vice-chancellor who attended the meeting said.Almost all universities were of the opinion that the students should not be asked to write the papers on the campuses in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the VC said.The colleges will have to identify the students who do not have the facilities at home for taking an online test and make alternative arrangements for them. One possible option is to send the question papers to those students so they can write the answers following the open-book examination system, which the UGC guidelines allow.The Supreme Court had on Friday upheld the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) directive to the universities to hold final-year undergraduate and postgraduate exams by September 30. But the apex court also left it to the state governments to decide whether they would postpone the exams because of the Covid-related situation.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said after the Supreme Court gave its directive that she would ask the education minister to discuss the matter with the VCs and take a decision on when to conduct the exams.Bengal was among the states that had opposed holding final-year undergraduate and postgraduate exams out of fear that the students, and through them their families, would be exposed to the Covid-19 infection.The state higher education department had on June 27 advised the universities that final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students should be assessed by giving 80 per cent weightage to the best performance in the previous semester/year and 20 per cent to the marks in the internal exams of the current semester/year.The advisory was issued in line with the UGC’s April 29 guideline that had given the universities the flexibility to decide on the mode of examination.On July 6, the UGC issued fresh guidelines saying the terminal semester/annual exams of the graduating students would have to be held by September 30, through pen-and-paper or online or a combination of the two.The education minister told the VCs on Monday that the state government would not issue any fresh advisory regarding exams for the final-year students.Several universities had already assessed the final-year students on the basis of their performance in the previous university exams and declared the results.These universities too will have to conduct the exams, as directed by the Supreme Court.The third-year BA and BSc exams under the 1+1+1 system and the final (sixth) semester exams in BCom were scheduled for April but got deferred because of Covid-19. The final-year (fourth) semester postgraduate exams also got deferred because of the pandemic.",2020-01-09 01:52:00
43,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Covid scare shadow on turnout for JEE (Main) - Telegraph India,"A number of examinees will stay away from JEE (Main), which start on Tuesday and will continue till the end of the week, because of the fear of contracting Covid-19.A student who lives in Deshapriya Park has been assigned an examination centre in Belghoria, 20km away, and his parents have decided that he will skip the exam on Wednesday and appear next year instead.But most students, and their parents, are not ready to sit the test out and try their luck next year. Most engineering colleges across the country admit students through JEE (Main).The government has said public transport will be available but many parents are scrambling to arrange for private transport because they fear their children would be exposed to the coronavirus if they travel in public vehicles.Anurag Chatterjee, 18, of Serampore in Hooghly district, will have to travel more than 30km on Thursday to write the test. He and a friend will hire a vehicle. “If the exam is held, one has to go. Or else, a year will be lost,” said Anurag’s father Rabindranath Chatterjee.Parents fear distancing norms, key to keep the virus at bay, would not be followed when students enter or leave an exam venue. “The entry and exit are bound to be crowded because each examinee is usually accompanied by at least one parent,” said Chandrima Ghosh, from Deshapriya Park. She and her husband have decided that their son will not appear in the test this year.Son Prithvish Shankar Ghosh has to appear in the exam in the second shift and report one hour and 10 minutes before it starts. “I have to wait for him for three hours till the exam is done. We will expose ourselves and also my mother, who is 75, to the risk of catching the virus,” his mother said.Students are also bothered about whether distancing norms would be followed outside the centre, too. “My exam is in the first shift and I anticipate there will be a crowd outside for the second shift. But if I wait till next year, there will be more candidates and more competition,” said New Town resident Tejesh Jain, whose test centre is in Belghoria.The government has asked the transport department to ensure usual services of buses, taxis and autos. More government buses will be on the roads.All transport options will be available from 7am to 7.30pm in the city. In parts of North and South 24-Parganas and Howrah, gover-nment buses will be available from 6am. Students stranded on the roads can get in touch with a control room set up by the transport department through 18003455192 (toll-free number) and 8902017191 (WhatsApp).Students will carry face shields, masks and sanitisers. They have been provided with a self-declaration form, which they have to submit at the test centre.They will have to declare whether they have flu-like symptoms like fever, cough, breathlessness, sore throat/runny nose and/or body ache in the last 14 days. They also have to state whether they came in close contact (less than one metre for more than 15 minutes) with a Covid patient in the last 14 days and whether they are under “mandatory quarantine”.Candidates are advised to carry a 50ml hand sanitiser bottle and a transparent water bottle, and maintain a distance of 6ft from each other. Each candidate will be given a three-ply mask, which he or she is expected to wear at the centre.",2020-01-09 01:53:00
44,Kinsuk Basu,Covid: Belur Math will not allow visitors during Durga Puja  - Telegraph India,"The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted Belur Math to decide against allowing visitors during Durga Puja this year, breaking with a tradition for the first time since Swami Vivekananda started the festival at the headquarters of Ramakrishna Math and Mission 119 years ago.   Senior monks steering the Belur Math administration decided at a recent meeting that this year the Puja would be held inside the Ramakrishna temple, and not in a pandal on the ground to the east of the temple like in previous years.This is the first time since 2000 that Durga Puja will be held inside the temple, monks said. “All rituals of Durga Puja, including the Kumari Puja, will be held as usual. But considering the pandemic, we will not allow visitors inside the Math,” Swami Suvirananda, the general secretary of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, said.Every year, lakhs of devotees and visitors would turn up during Durga Puja at Belur Math and gather in the huge pandal that would be erected for the occasion.Belur Math had shut its gates to visitors on March 15 as a precaution against the coronavirus. The gates were reopened on June 15 and visitors were required to undergo a series of checks before they were let in.But soon thereafter, several monks and employees at the Math tested positive for Covid-19. The administrators again decided to shut the gates to visitors on August 2.“After remaining open for 45 days, we realised that the arrival of visitors was a principal reason for the spread of the virus” on the Math premises, Swami Suvirananda said. “We have carried out a series of tests since and have taken several precautionary measures. The transmission of the virus at the Math appears to have been contained for now.”Close to 300 monks and 250 employees live on the campus of Belur Math, which is spread over 40 acres on the Hooghly’s western bank.

45,Pinak Ghosh,Bars can open from today with conditions in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has allowed serving of liquor at bars and restaurants starting Tuesday.The Union home ministry’s guidelines had allowed resumption of hospitality services from June 8 but prohibited consumption of liquor at public places. So, restaurants and bars were unable to serve liquor, which constitutes around 60 per cent of their daily business.The ministry’s Unlock 4 guidelines, issued on Saturday, did not include “bar” on the list of prohibited services.An order issued by the Bengal excise department on Monday allows serving of liquor for consumption in the licensed area of an “on” premises (where one can sit and drink).Besides restaurants and bars, establishments such as theatres, clubs, canteens, dak-bunglows, railway refreshment rooms, dining cars, steamers, airport, or public resorts with attached bars shall also be allowed to serve liquor from Tuesday.But there are certain caveats:The excise department’s order also states that considering the pandemic situation, serving liquor will not be mandatory, leaving the choice to the restaurants and bars.“It surely is a positive step forward. The reality is that the past few months have been unique in every way. Going to a restaurant is an overall experience. There is the ambience, food and beverage are all part of that experience. If even one element is missing, then the experience loses its value. But the fact is we need to be responsible about how we go ahead,” said Gaurav Singh, general manager, JW Mariott, Calcutta.“This was much awaited and will be a great help for the revival of the hospitality industry, especially bars and restaurants. Most importantly lakhs of people will be employed again…. Typically, liquor constitutes 60 per cent of the entire sales on a daily basis at restaurants. A person who was not coming for drinks is affecting food sales as well,” said Sudesh Poddar, honorary secretary, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India.“Based on the order, we will issue the requisite advisory from tomorrow.

48,Sanjay Mandal,Covid patient occupancy runs thin at Kolkata satellite units  - Telegraph India,"Many private hospitals in Calcutta said on Monday the number of Covid-19 patients in their satellite units was going down because of several reasons, including reluctance of some insurance companies to foot the entire bill.Among other reasons are patients’ concern about medical facilities at satellite units and guidance offered by physicians on what to do when a Covid-19 patient is in home isolation.Belle Vue Clinic has set up a 25-room satellite fac-ility at a hotel in Beckbagan. On Monday, the unit had only one occupant.Medica Superspecialty Hospital has a satellite unit that can accommodate 52 Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. On Monday, there was only one patient. The RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences has tied up with two hotels to accommodate 52 patients. There were only five on Monday.“The number of occupants started dropping sharply over the last couple of weeks. We were having about 35 patients on an average daily earlier,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, which runs the RN Tagore hospital.Belle Vue officials said their satellite unit would have 20 occupants till a couple of weeks back. Medica would have 40 patients staying at its facilities.“We are spending about Rs 25 lakh a month to run the facilities, which include paying rent to the hotels and our overhead costs. We are keeping a watch on the situation and if the numbers don't increase, then we have to take a decision,” Medica chairman Alok Roy said.The state government had on June 15 said private hospitals could set up “satellite facilities” for Covid-19 patients with no or mild symptoms to free up beds reserved for such cases. The health department had said in a guideline that private hospitals could set up “satellite facilities” or observation wards at hotels or guest houses in the vicinity of their campuses.Initially, the number of occupants was less because the insurance companies were not paying for the stay. Later, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority allowed insurance coverage for patients staying in the units and the occupancy started rising, said hospital officials.Sources said doctors individually or in groups had tied up with hotels and started satellite units hoping there would be a good number of patients.But after a few weeks of good occupancy, the numbers started falling again. “The insurance companies are paying but only 60 to 70 per cent on an average of each bill. Sometimes, they are rejecting cashless claims saying these patients could have stayed in home isolation,” the CEO of a private hospital that runs a satellite unit said.A 10-day stay for a Covid patient at a satellite unit costs between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh, depending on the type of hotel.“Now, after several months into the pandemic, awareness has grown and people are feeling safer in home isolation. They don’t want to be at such units.Besides, often doctors are not willing to leave hospital duty and go to these facilities,” said the CEO. Homecare providers are advising asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms, boosting their confidence to stay in home isolation. Apollo Homecare used to have 100-odd patients to look after every day about a month back.“The number is now 200. We are providing clinical as well as psychological counselling for people in home isolation. People feel assured,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, regional head of Apollo Healthcare, eastern India.Doctors said technology was enabling people to prefer home isolation over the satellite facilities.“Our team of doctors is doing video calls with the patients and they feel assured. They know that if their condition turns serious, we would advise them hospitalisation,” said physician Rahul Jain. “Besides, at many residential complexes, people are no longer objecting to their neighbours who are Covid-19 positive to stay home.”",2020-01-09 01:59:00
49,Our Special Correspondent,Aged couple in Parnasree abused for drink protest  - Telegraph India,"An elderly couple in Parnasree have alleged that a few drunks hurled abuses at them when they protested against the men drinking outside their home and creating a ruckus on Sunday night.They have also accused police of inaction when they had dialed the police helpline, 100. Getting no help, the woman accompanied her son to Parnasree police station after midnight to report the matter.Later on Monday, when senior officers got to know of it, they apologised to the family and sent a team to meet the elderly couple at their home assuring them of help and support, the couple’s son said on Monday evening.“It was quarter to midnight on Sunday when we heard two men talking in an objectionable way. They were sitting outside our home, drinking. I was in my room on the first floor while my parents were downstairs when they started talking loudly,” Prabalkanti Sarkar said.His father Pralay Kanti Sarkar, 86, who has various physical ailments, had requested the men from his window to move away from their house as the loud noise was disturbing them.“Instead of going away, the men started hurling abuses at my father and banging our grille gate. I rushed downstairs. But by the time I could open the lock and step out they had fled on a motorcycle,” Sarkar said.The family tried calling up the police station on its landline. But there was no response. They then dialled 100 and got connected to the police. The family was told the landline at the police station went dead in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan.After 15 minutes two cops came, one in uniform, Sarkar said. “When we tried to tell them what had happened, the one in uniform said I was drunk and not the men against whom we were complaining. He said ours was a ‘low-class family’ and that we were in for trouble.”Sarkar said his parents felt so humiliated that his mother Ela, 80, accompanied him to the police station.At the station, an assistant sub-inspector asked his mother why she was there so late in the night, he said. “The ASI kept asking why my mother was at the police station. He kept us waiting for the duty officer for the next 40minutes. When the duty officer, a sub-inspector, came, he was surprised that we had been made to wait. Things started moving after that.”On Monday morning, the officer-in-charge of the police station, Manoj Jha, contacted the family on the phone. “The OC was extremely cooperative. He sent a team of officers  to speak to us,” he said.Jha said the police had not received any written complaint against the cops. “We have registered a general diary based on the family’s complaint of social nuisance. We are looking into the allegations against the police.”Deputy commissioner, south west, Nilanjan Biswas and joint commissioner, headquarters, Subhankar Sinha Sarkar did not respond to Metro’s text messages regarding the allegations against the police.",2020-01-09 02:01:00

51,Our Special Correspondent,Traffic rule reminder for Kolkata cyclists - Telegraph India,"Cyclists will have to follow traffic rules, especially the one-way rule, police said on Monday while extending the permission for free movement of cycles on all roads barring main arterial roads till September 30.The city police had on June 9 given cyclists this permission based on a decision taken by the state cabinet. The order was in force till August 31.Anuj Sharma, the city police commissioner, on Monday issued a fresh notification extending the relaxation till September 30 with a reminder to cyclists to follow the one-way and other traffic rules.Cyclists, according to traffic cops, tend to break the one-way rule. They are often spotted moving in the opposite direction of the traffic flow.The purpose of allowing cycles on roads barring the arterial ones was for the convenience of hundreds of people who either do not have access to public transport or want to travel alone as a precautionary measure during the pandemic, an officer said.“We are not prosecuting cyclists for violating traffic rules for the time being. But we always encourage them to use the lanes,” the officer said.Several Calcuttans have chosen cycles as their mode of transport during the lockdown. There are some who have stopped using cars and opted for cycles as part of the “new normal”.“Cycling has been my passion. I took this opportunity to shift to a cycle instead of taking out my four-wheeler during the lockdown. I avoid the main roads and take the parallel lanes to reach my office,” Sudipto Roy, an official at Exide Industries Ltd, said.He covers around 4km from his south Calcutta home to reach his office.The city police had on February 13, 2014, issued a notification listing 62 roads where cycles are restricted at stipulated times.The list hasn’t been changed; which means the restrictions are still there, a traffic police officer said.The list can be accessed on www.kolkatatrafficpolice.net under Traffic Restrictions.",2020-01-09 02:06:00
52,Our Special Correspondent,Kite string slashes biker on Parama flyover - Telegraph India,"A motorcyclist was left bleeding from a slashed chin by a kite string on the Parama flyover on Sunday evening, police said.Rohit Sau, 30, who runs a business of supplying building material, said he was moving at medium speed when the string struck his face. He got the time to catch the string with one hand and protect his throat, Sau said.“I was purely lucky that I could react on time and remove the string and change its angle; otherwise it would have slashed my throat straightaway and not my chin,” Sau said.The string cut through the face mask he was wearing and slashed his chin.The Picnic Gardens resident is the eldest of four siblings.He had taken the flyover to reach a construction site behind Spring Club where he has been supplying building materials, he said.An injured Sau reached the Beleghata traffic guard on his motorcycle where he received first aid. He then went to Topsia police station to report the matter.“If the police cannot people from flying kites in the area, it is better to completely restrict the movement of two-wheelers on flyovers. This could have been fatal,” Sau said.Sau is among the many two-wheeler riders injured on the Parama and AJC Bose Road flyovers by kite strings.The police have been keeping a watch with binoculars from highrises. Cops have distributed leaflets to make people aware of the dangers of flying kites near flyovers.Many people have been arrested for manufacturing and selling kite strings and spools to discourage the flying of kites in the Beniapukur, Topsia, Tiljala and Park Circus area.“We have been trying to tackle this problem but it has remained unsolved… practically it is not possible to detect the place from where a kite is being flown… it could be kilometres away,” a traffic police officer said.",2020-01-09 02:08:00
53,Subhajoy Roy,New Town looks to fill Metro gap - Telegraph India,"The New Town authorities are exploring the most environment-friendly mode of public transport for a 7.5km stretch that will not be connected by the New Garia-Airport Metro, a Hidco official said on Monday.The Metro network will not cover the 7.5km stretch between the Biswa Bangla gate and the last point of Action Area III to the east of Sukhobrishti.The residential area on this stretch has been growing by the day. In a few more years, the area will be teeming with people. Plots of IT companies such as Wipro and Infosys, multiple educational institutions and mini townships like Sukhobrishti, which has 10,000 homes, are part of this area.Depending on buses, autos and e-rickshaws to transport the large number of people living in the area or going there for work will make snarls an everyday affair, according to the township authorities.It will be a repeat of what Calcutta goes through and the authorities do not want that to happen in a new and upcoming township, the Hidco official said. Neither do they want people to use their cars as a more comfortable transport option while avoiding overcrowded buses.“If we allow autos and totos to mushroom to cover this 7.5km distance, it will lead to traffic congestion when more people start living and working here. More buses, too, will eat up the available road space,” Debashis Sen, the chairman and managing director of Hidco, said.“So, we are looking for a mode of transport that will carry a large number of people without reducing the available road space and will be environment-friendly, too. It can be monorail, or other kinds of light rail, ropeways or even pods.”In India, Gurgaon has such a light rail network to connect places that are not connected by the Delhi Metro network. “The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation runs the Metro till the border of Delhi and Gurgaon. There is something called Rapid Metro, rakes with two coaches that take people from the border to the interiors of Gurgaon,” Alekhya Datta, a fellow with The Energy and Resources Institute, said.Hidco had considered introducing monorail in this part of the township about three years ago. But KPMG, which was the consultant then, had told the authorities that the returns from monorail would be inadequate for an investor to run the services. Also, the initial investment will be huge, the agency had said.Hidco has invited bids to select a consultant. The consultant will be asked to keep in mind the economic viability of the mode of transport they suggest, Sen said. “It must yield returns for the investor. Only then an investor will be interested.”",2020-01-09 02:08:00
54,Debraj Mitra And Elora Sen,Fish-retail app bites more than it can deliver during lockdown - Telegraph India,"Many Calcuttans who ordered frozen fish online from a government app have not got the items delivered even well beyond the expected date.Some of them, who have already paid online, are yet to hear a word on refund.Officials of the State Fisheries Development Corporation (SFDC), which maintains the app, attributed the problem to a nearly 12-time increase in the number of daily orders in the last week of March and the reduction in manpower because of the lockdown.“We are equipped to handle 50 to 60 orders a day. But in the last week of March, we got over 600 orders a day,” said Subrata Mukherjee, the managing director of SFDC.The number of orders kept surging but the manpower headed south. “We are dependant on unorganised sector workers — not directly on the government payroll — for netting, dressing, storing, packing and delivering fish. Many workers come from North and South 24-Parganas. Many of them have not been coming because of the lockdown,” said Mukherjee.As of Thursday afternoon, there were close to 4,000 pending orders, said sources in the corporation.“For now, we are focussing on delivering pending orders for which payments have been made. The cash-on-delivery orders cannot be delivered now,” said an official.Mukherjee said anyone who cancelled the order would get a refund and those who did not would get their orders soon.A message on the SFDC website on Thursday read: “Due to overwhelming number of orders for home delivery of fish during the period of lockdown, no further orders are being accepted for the time being. New orders will be allowed as soon as old pending orders are delivered.” A similar message will be uploaded on the app, too, the official said.A 53-year-old woman from Heysham Road in Bhowanipore, who works with a global consultancy firm, had ordered two kilos of dressed katla through the app on March 28. Her bill came to Rs 761, which she paid via credit card at the time of placing the order.“I normally buy fish from a private online platform that had shut before the lockdown. I was relieved after placing the order from a government platform,” she said.The expected date of delivery was March 29. The woman is yet to get the items. In between, she has made multiple calls to a customer care number printed on the invoice and also sent a mail to an address mentioned on the SFDC website. But to avail. “No one picks up the phone,” she said.A woman who lives on Ritchie Road underwent a similar experience. The chartered accountant with a power utility had ordered one kilo of katla and 500gm of parshe and bekti each on March 28.She had paid Rs 1,694 through credit card while ordering but did not get the fish till Thursday.“I understand there is a crisis. I don’t need a refund and won’t mind if the fish is delivered after the crisis is over. But all I need is proper communication from their end,” said the woman, who had sent a message on the SFDC enquiry portal but is yet to get a reply.With too few private players in operation and physical markets inaccessible for many, the SFDC app has been getting a lot of online traction since the lockdown started on March 24.Till a couple of days ago, there were around 1,000 pending orders. “The number came down to 300 on Thursday. We will deliver these orders as soon as possible,” said an official.Mukherjee said the SFDC had tied up with an online food aggregator to deliver fish. “The delivery through the app should start from Friday. That will reduce the burden on us,” he told Metro.The SFDC owns 900 hectares of water body for fish farming across the East Calcutta Wetlands, Salt Lake, Rajarhat, Henry’s Island, Frasergunj, Digha and other parts of the state. It produces over 15,000 metric tonnes of fish a year.",2020-02-04 22:16:00
55,Sanjay Mandal,Take people along in fight against coronavirus: Doctor - Telegraph India,"A bottom-up strategy, not a top-down approach by governments using force, is needed to carry people along and ensure the success of a long lockdown like the 21-day exercise now underway, said a doctor who is part of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s task force on Covid-19.“The fight against Covid-19 is going to be a long battle and not a short-term one. So, it’s very important to take people along when governments all across are trying to enforce a lockdown. Otherwise, a time might come when desperation will prevail over medical science,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, Calcutta-based gastro-enterologist and a member of the task force.In several parts of India, people have been coming out of their homes, and there have been allegations of police excesses. Mamata had advised the police to be humane.“It has to be combat and care. Care being a very important element, which is missing in the current national approach. Now, it seems more like policing,” Chowdhury said.A participatory and collective effort is needed, and governments have to be the point of convergence of a widely carpeted programme that imbibes involvement of everybody possible into the network.He said forcing people to stay indoors could make many feel that the lockdown was meant for the safety of the privileged class.“There were similar problems during the polio eradication drive. The underprivileged section of society had thought their infants were forced to have anti-polio vaccines in order to keep people of the privileged class safe,” Chowdhury said.“In order to ensure people’s participation and make the lockdown effective, each locality could form a coronavirus control team with self-help groups, school teachers, panchayat members and others,” Chowdhury said. This can be done through groups of two or by using telephone connections.The community groups should make people aware of how lockdown can prevent the spread of the disease and ensure that those whose incomes have become uncertain are assured of food and other basic necessities.One has to be scientifically aligned, lay stress on the importance of personal hygiene such as washing hands with soaps, social distancing, not spitting in the open and the need to cover the face with the elbow while coughing.“People locked indoors and being fed a lot of unscientific as well as fear-generating information may get anxious. They can react to such false information and get depressed. If we make them aware through community participation, they will listen to the authorities,” Chowdhury said.He said the quarantine centres, where hundreds of thousands of people are being kept, should have decent arrangements.“People should not be forced into quarantine. It, too, should be a participatory endeavour. People who have been quarantined need to understand that they are doing so on their own volition and not through imposition. If this is a police-driven exercise, then people with fever may hide in fear and not report,” said Chowdhury.“Quarantine facilities are not cages and it is best to create an ambience there with interpersonal connections,” he said.On migrant workers who have returned from other states and countries, Chowdhury said they should be not be looked at with suspicion by the neighbours and the administration, which would result in forced quarantine. “Rather, this should be done through persuasion,” he said.He feels dedicated Covid hospitals should be identified in each sub-division because people need to be assured that sufficient arrangements have been made.Organisations like the Indian Medical Association could be involved by the governments, which could have a rotational group for providing support to the government-led action in medical care in a particular region. That should be centrally coordinated by the administration. “It is time for convergence, and let us do that, keeping all our different hats,” Chowdhury said.“It’s very important to fight the stigma, ostracisation and fear mongering,” he added.",2020-02-04 22:22:00
57,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Musical message from Gariahat cops during lockdown - Telegraph India,"Gariahat police on Thursday found a musical way to reach out to residents and tell them why they should remain indoors and follow the government rules on lockdown.The officers picked up microphones and sang a Bengali song based on a popular Anjan Dutt track.“Eta ki 23412600, daktarder parcho ki shunte? Hanchi, kashi, shordi ba swash koshto holey, choley jao shoja haspatale. (Is this 23412600, can you hear what doctors are saying? Go and visit hospital if you are suffering from cough, cold, sneezing or respiratory problem),” they sang.The lyrics promoted the coronavirus helpline number (23412600) and advised people to stay indoors during the lockdown, reminding them that the number of confirmed cases was rising and so the need of the hour was to follow the government orders.“Hello! 23412600 Thako na ektu ghor bondi hoye/ Meter jachchhe bere oi Covid akromone/Sabdhan hote bolchhe sarkar (Hello! 23412600 . Please stay indoors. The Covid count is increasing and the government is asking you to be careful),” went the song.Gariahat police officers said all police stations were trying to find unique ways to create awareness and they decided to do it through music.The officer in-charge of the police station, inspector Soumya Banerjee, sergeant Debjit Mukherjee and sergeant Sourav Chakraborty took the lead and penned the lyrics to the tune of Dutt’s Bela Bose on Wednesday. The trio practised at the police station till late on Wednesday. Inspector Banerjee got some last-minute “training” from daughter Sourita, a trained classical singer, at home on Thursday. “We are so happy that people liked what we did. The most beautiful part was when we were walking back to the police station, everyone standing on the balconies and by windows were clapping. All our efforts will be successful if people follow what we tried to say,” Banerjee told Metro on Thursday night.A recording of the performance has been shared several thousand times on Facebook and through WhatsApp.The officer-in-charge of Entally police station, Debasis Datta, had sung “We shall overcome” at a market in his area on Wednesday to spread a message of hope and encourage people to follow coronavirus guidelines.",2020-02-04 22:25:00
58,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Beware of traffickers: Child rights panel - Telegraph India,"A pandemic and widespread displacement from homes could be the perfect opportunity for human traffickers, the state child rights panel has warned the district authorities and asked them to take necessary precautions and strict measures to protect children. “Once the Covid-19 crisis is over and daily wage labourers are in a desperate situation because of homelessness and loss of work, they will become more vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers,” said Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti, the chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights. A statements issued by the commission on Thursday said: “Pandemic crisis or natural disaster is historically proven to be a critical push factor. Children are the most vulnerable ones during such situations. Since the risk of missing and trafficking of minors and girls always shoots up during these times, WBCPCR has expressed its concern about the safety and security of the children, specially who are living in street situations & poor socio-economic conditions in the society.”The note has been sent to district magistrates and superintendents of police in the state.Those working for child protection said often the marginalised ended up in a “debt trap” after a crisis, which in turn made them more vulnerable.“In the absence of livelihood, they might borrow from money lenders and end up in debt. Once a crisis is over, they might find it difficult to get a job and borrow more and end up in a debt trap. Children may be sent to work as domestic help to come out of the situation and end up getting trafficked,” said Indrani Chakraborty, child protection and anti-trafficking expert, Global Fund for Children, India chapter, an organisation that works for the rights of vulnerable children. Traffickers often use marriage and jobs as bait.“When the pandemic situation is over, one of the things to promote is safe migration so that they are less vulnerable,” said Saji Philip, the director of operations of NGO International Justice Mission. Philip said the government could instil confidence in people and send across messages through child protection committees to encourage parents not to let children discontinue studies.

The arrests were made after a channel’s representative lodged a complaint with the cyber crime police station in Salt Lake.The men had used two smartphones to download the news channel’s logo and template, an officer of the police station said. “They then used the phones to circulate the messages. The contents ranged from fake death toll to fake new cases in the state. It sparked panic among people. This was done to spread panic and malign the channel.”The inspector-in-charge of the police station, Bidit Mondal, said the two were tracked down through the original IP address — the electronic device’s fingerprint that is used to access the Internet. “The fake messages and posts had been circulated thousands of times”.The two have been booked under various IPC sections , including 500 (defamation), 505 (public mischief) and 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation).The charges carry a maximum punishment of six years in jail and/or fine.A Salt Lake court sent both to police custody for four days.",2020-02-04 22:30:00
60,Mita Mukherjee,Class V & VIII students to be promoted: Partha Chatterjee - Telegraph India,"All students of Classes V and VIII in state-aided schools will be promoted to the next class, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Thursday.The state government had reintroduced the pass-fail system for these classes from the session that started in January this year. Students who fail to clear the annual exams in December will be detained, the government had earlier announced.The no-detention system for Class I-VIII, mandated by the Centre’s right to education act, was introduced in 2009 to prevent underprivileged students aged below 14 from quitting studies for fear of failure.Minister Chatterjee on Thursday said every student would be promoted to the next class irrespective of their performance in the annual exams to be held in December. “The pass-fail system for Classes V and VIII will not be implemented this year because of the present situation. Every student will go to the next class.”The government had planned to introduce from this year supplementary exams for the students of Classes I to IV, VI and VII who will perform poorly in the annual exams. That, too, will be kept on hold, the minister told Metro.  The government had earlier said that schools could arrange special exams for low scorers of these classes after providing them with additional coaching after the annual exams.“There will be no such tests this time. Every student will move to the next class after the annual exams,” Chatterjee said. The Central Board of Second Education (CBSE) under the HRD ministry has announced that students of Classes I-VIII in its schools, including in Kendriya Viyalayas, will be promoted to the next class this year.Minister Chatterjee on Thursday announced that the government was working on a scheme to start online classes for students of Classes IX to XII in state-aided Madhymik and Higher Secondary schools. “The government is examining if classes can be held with the help of Net through emails and even with the help of Doordarshan,” Chatterjee said. “Preliminary discussions have been held. A final plan will be prepared once we get chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s approval,” he said.",2020-02-04 22:31:00
61,Subhankar Chowdhury,Digital-divide caution from Jadavpur VC - Telegraph India,"The Jadavpur University vice-chancellor has asked teachers to be “cautious” about conducting online classes or sharing digital content as “many students may not be able to afford a desktop computer or laptop at home, or may be staying in a remote village, with limited or no Internet connectivity”.The note signed by VC Suranjan Das has been circulated among the heads of all departments under the arts faculty by pro-VC Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya.Metro had reported last week that some teachers of the humanities stream at Jadavpur University were using the gaming platform, Discord, or digital facilities such as Skype to hold classes from home during the 21-day lockdown that began on April 24 midnight.   “I personally support taking online classes under this unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic on digital platform, like ZOOM or others…. However the socio-economic background of many JU students should be kept in mind. Many students may not be able to afford a desktop computer or laptop at their home…. Under these circumstances, option for online classes or digital content sharing should be exercised cautiously,” the note from the VC said.Asked why he had issued the note of caution, Das told Metro: “I am opposed to creating any digital divide among my students in the name of teaching through digital platforms. Teachers must keep in mind that our university has a heterogeneous composition in terms of students with many coming from villages, having limited or no Internet access. We should not be doing anything to make those students feel they have been left out.”A professor of the university said a substantial percentage of students across disciplines come from villages in South 24-Parganas, Birbhum, Bankura and other districts. Many of these students do not have computers and live in places with poor or no Internet connectivity. “Digital divide is an issue for these students,” he said.“Soft copy of the class notes can be shared through email (or group email) to students of a particular class. However, it may kindly be noted that we have not taken any decision on online classes, and sharing digital content across email, and no central policy has yet been framed under the present circumstances. But I encourage online classes,” the note said.Das said he was aware that many undergraduate students of a college affiliated to Delhi University were also facing the problem of digital divide.“Some of those students have gone back to places like Jammu and Kashmir because of the closure. When the teachers of a department tried to hold online classes for them along with others settled in cities like Delhi and Calcutta, the students complained of not being able to access the classes because of poor connectivity. Digital divide cannot be brushed aside,” Das said.Considering this divide, the VC has advised teachers against going evaluation/ grading for internal assessment online. “Moreover, any sort of evaluation/grading for the internals must not be done through the online mode, as the facilities may not be available to all the students,” Das has written in the note. The higher education department has of late sought to find out from vice-chancellors whether they are taking recourse to digital platforms during the lockdown to complete the syllabus and sought to be updated about adherence to the steps.Asked whether the digital divide would pose any problem, an official of the department said: “We have advised them to opt for digital platforms as much as and wherever possible. The universities have to work out a strategy accordingly.”",2020-02-04 22:31:00
62,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Lockdown in Calcutta: How to pay help? How to get plumbers? - Telegraph India,"Police across the city have been flooded with calls from residents seeking to know how to pay their help or get electricians or plumbers during the lockdown.Families granted their help leave with pay before the lockdown had started. Many of them are facing problems paying their help, especially the ones who do not have a bank account.“My help does not have a bank account, so I cannot transfer money online. I sent her home to Bishnupur (in South 24-Parganas). Now is the time to pay her the wage for March and we are clueless about how to do that. Can special passes be issued to help so they can visit their employers and collect their wages?” asked a Gariahat resident.Police officers across the city said they were getting calls from residents who wanted to know how they could pay their help. An officer clarified that there was no provision for issuing passes for help to collect their salaries.An officer on the southern fringes of the city said his police station had received multiple calls from housing societies about how to get electricians or plumbers to tackle an emergency.“Some of the estates have more than 300 flats. Those who have failed to keep plumbers and electricians on their premises are facing problems. They want to know how those personnel could reach housing estates to fix an emergency in the absence of public transport options,” an officer said.Another officer said one or two requests could be taken care of by sending a police vehicle but that could not be a permanent solution.“Maybe we can ask all police stations to collate data from housing complexes in their respective areas and appoint a nodal officer for handling such problems,” said an officer posted in central Calcutta.Senior officers at Lalbazar said they were aware of calls from anxious residents seeking interventions of cops in matters that are beyond traditional policing.An officer said the best way was to retain the emergency staff in housing societies by paying them extra for their service during the lockdown.“What will you do if the lift goes out of order in a 30-storey building? Nothing is more precious than human life. All housing societies should understand this and retain their emergency staff, if needed by paying extra,” the officer said.Complaints",2020-02-04 22:40:00
63,Our Special Correspondent,Vigil against lockdown violators stepped up - Telegraph India,"Police stepped up vigil on Thursday following reports that a growing number of people are violating the lockdown and stepping out even when there is no pressing need to do so.Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma instructed his officers to ask people through loudspeakers to stay indoors and be strict against those who are hitting the roads without any justifiable reason.The city police on Thursday arrested 980 people who allegedly failed to cite any acceptable reason for being out of their homes. On Wednesday, only 48 people were arrested.The wide gap in the two days’ arrest figures has triggered charges that the police had of late been slack in enforcing the lockdown, which has been imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus.On Thursday, the police increased their presence across the city and did not allow anyone who could not produce documents to support their claims of urgency. The maximum number of violations were reported from the central division.Instances of lockdown violation had also been reported in large numbers from pockets in North and South 24-Parganas and Howrah over the past few days. There were reports from North 24-Parganas that tea stalls, grocery shops, sugarcane juice stalls and sweet shops were drawing a large number of people.The scene was much the same in most of Howrah. “Most shops are open and there are crowds in front of them. Police are there but they seem reluctant to enforce social distancing,” said a resident of Howrah.Sources said the police force across the state had got cold feet and were no longer keen on enforcing the lockdown following the government’s decision to punish 12 cops for their alleged excesses.An officer of Bengal police said: “It is difficult to be polite and soft when we are trying to enforce the lockdown. Some officers probably crossed the line and were punished. But that has made a section of the force jittery.”Some officers said the “problem” had increased with the issuing of e-passes that allows one to move around the city during the lockdown.“Calcutta police and Bengal police both are giving the passes. This has resulted in an increase in the number of cars on the roads. These days sweet shops are open, too. So, we have to grant permission to someone who says he is going to buy sweets,” said an officer.",2020-02-04 22:40:00
64,Kinsuk Basu,Medicine supply chain moves during lockdown - Telegraph India,"Medicines started reaching stores on Thursday following the state government’s effort to bring wholesalers, dealers, distributors, clearing agents and retailers on the same page through a WhatsApp group.“Medicine shops in Calcutta and adjoining areas started  getting their supplies on Thursday morning after some pharma companies nudged their clearing agents to ensure  that the stock lying in godowns reach retailers,” a government official said.Retailers said the supply fell far short of the demand but they could at least keep their shops open.“I am somehow being able to manage as supplies have started,” said Subir Sen of Garia Medical Agency. “But the situation is yet to be normal. Demand for medicines continues to be high.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on March 28 met a few representatives of Bagree Market, a wholesale hub for medicines in the city, to understand what was preventing drugs from reaching retailers.The next day, officials of the health department called representatives of the industry — including wholesalers, distributors, clearing agents and those running medicine shop chains — to a meeting.Sources said health secretary Vivek Kumar had chaired the meeting.At the end of the meeting, a WhatsApp group was created with representatives of various sections of the industry. An official was designated as chief coordinator of the group.The meeting decided that if a truck ferrying medicines got stuck, the health department would coordinate with police and try to find a way to get the vehicle moving.Since then, suppliers and distributors have been in regular touch with one another to find a way to keep the supply chain moving.Clearing agents are a vital cog in the chain. Medicines from manufacturers reach clearing agents designated by them.The agents send medicines to wholesalers — located mostly at Bagree Market and Mehta Building in central Calcutta — from where supplies reach retail outlets.“Clearing agents have had to hire labourers and  arrange accommodation for them in godowns to ensure supply of medicines. This is remarkable and would not have been possible without the state government’s support,” said Sankha Roychowdhury, the president of the Bengal Chemist and Druggist Association. “It’s a collective effort and all of us are trying to join hands.”",2020-02-04 22:44:00
66,Sanjay Mandal And Subhajoy Roy,Plan for more quarantine facilities across Bengal - Telegraph India,"More quarantine facilities are being planned across Bengal as part of an attempt to identify as many people exposed to the coronavirus as possible and minimise chances of community transmission of the pathogen, health department officials said on Thursday.“Getting Covid-19 (the disease caused by the coronavirus) treatment centres equipped with high-end critical care facilities will become difficult if the number of patients start growing rapidly. Across the world, there are shortages of ventilators and beds. So, we need to get more people who have come in close contact with coronavirus patients or their contacts to observation facilities,” an official said.“At quarantine centres it would be easier to monitor mild symptoms and a person can be immediately shifted to hospital if needed. We have come across multiple instances of Covid-19 patients being taken to hospital in a critical condition.”Besides, asymptomatic carriers of the virus are as much a source of infection as the ones showing symptoms. “Hence, there is an urgent need to get asymptomatic carriers quarantined,” another official of the health department said.“School buildings in the city as well as districts will be converted into quarantine facilities,” the official said.The Covid-19 task force set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee has recommended setting up of more quarantine or observation facilities, officials said.The state health department also started procuring a large number of items required for both hospitals and quarantine centres.The items include candles, garbage bags and bins, brooms, mops, fire extinguishers, e-toilets, generators, mattresses, bed sheets, pillows, pillow covers, towels, rubber sheets, blankets, mosquito repellents and spoons.The government is also buying ventilators for Covid-19 patients in a critical condition and personal protective equipment and masks for those involved in their treatment.According to the state health department, around 60,000 people have been “enlisted for observation/surveillance” at quarantine centres. Many of them have come out after spending the required number of days in quarantine.Almost an equal number of people have been asked to be quarantined at home. Close to 3,000 of them have completed their stay in isolation.“The problem with home surveillance is the difficulty we face in keeping track of the individuals daily. Also, in many households it’s difficult for a person in home quarantine to stay completely isolated from others in the family,” a member of the task force said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in a recent video conference, asked officials of all districts to set up quarantine facilities. She asked the authorities to use both private and government facilities for the purpose.",2020-02-04 22:44:00

It was around 2pm and in another two hours, his 15-year-old daughter’s dialysis would start at a nursing home in Bagbazar.Private buses were missing and the drivers of government-run ones chose to speed down the other side of the flank to avoid passengers at the stop. All buses were full to their seating capacity.“If I get late, dialysis will be cancelled,” the Bonhooghly resident said. “I had to come to south Calcutta to collect blood from a private blood bank. It was a struggle reaching here and now there aren’t any buses.”A cook with a catering agency, Biplab had stepped out with his daughter early on Tuesday. After an hour’s wait at the Bonhooghly bus stop, the father-daughter duo could board a bus to reach the nursing home for a pre-dialysis test.“There has been no work for two months.

68,Debraj Mitra,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Cable TV & Net still off in parts of Kolkata, shortage of hands cited - Telegraph India","A fortnight has passed after Cyclone Amphan had struck the city and power is back at most homes. Yet, cable TV and broadband services are a long way from normal.The storm had uprooted around 5,000 electric poles in the city, according to an estimate by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Multi-system operators cited shortage of manpower and crippled logistics, both because of the lockdown, as well as lack of coordination with the civic body and other agencies for the delay in resumption of uninterrupted services.The direct-to-home (DTH) and mobile internet service providers, too, are struggling to restore normality.A Gariahat resident tried calling the helpline of a DTH service provider for five days but in vain. “Finally, I got hold of the technician who usually visits my place. I paid some extra money and he did the job,” the resident told Metro.A Phoolbagan resident said his cable TV and broadband connections, provided by the same MSO, had snapped during the May 20 storm and were yet to be restored. A Behala resident who works with an online share trading platform had been virtually out of work for four days after the storm because of his snapped broadband connection. He earns a commission on each trade and being offline means zero income.“My phone’s internet was back on the fifth day. I am having to do with that. But the connection is slow,” he said.The city has at least seven MSOs that transmit TV signals through cables and more than 12 broadband service providers, which provide Net links using the same method. Operators tie their cables around lamp posts because the underground route is expensive.“Most of our men have returned to their villages because of the lockdown. We are having to do with a much-curtailed workforce,” said Suresh Sethia, director of Siti Cable. “Almost all cable TV connections have been restored but over 20 per cent of broadband links are yet to be restored”.An official of another MSO and broadband service provider said: “The CMC, CESC, army and other disaster management agencies have, at many places, snapped our cables while clearing trees and fixing tilted poles.”Vijay Agarwal, the managing director of GTPL-KCBPL, said fibre and accessories are usually brought in from other states. “Since transport was hit by the lockdown, getting the equipment to Bengal was a challenge,” said Agarwal. MSOs and broadband service providers met Firhad Hakim, chairman of the CMC board of administrators, on Tuesday evening. Sources said Hakim had asked the MSOs to start removing the defunct cables from the poles.",2020-02-06 20:28:00
69,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Damaged lamp posts around Kolkata pose safety hazard - Telegraph India,"Damaged or half-broken street lamps dot the roads of Calcutta almost two weeks after Cyclone Amphan had raged across the city.People out on roads fear these street lamps could crash any moment and cause an accident. The chances of someone getting injured are high as more vehicles and people have been out on the roads from Monday after the government eased lockdown restrictions, many have said.A street lamp on BB Chatterjee Road near Rathtala has been hanging at an angle of almost 45 degrees over the road since the cyclone struck on May 20, a resident of Kasba said.Innumerable cables are tied to the lamp post. If it collapses, all of them are likely to snap and fall on the road and no one knows which ones are live conduits, the resident said.She said she took BB Chatterjee Road every day to go to office and that she had seen the metal at the pole’s base had rusted and corroded.“Almost half of the metal has cracked… it can collapse any moment. It is better if the authorities remove the pole at the earliest.”A street lamp on SP Mukherjee Road near Mudiali is hanging the same way. At least a dozen cables are tied to it on either side.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is the custodian of all street lamps in the city. More than 5,000 lamp posts had fallen in the cyclone, a civic official said.The civic body is trying to remove all damaged lamp posts, the official said. “Our teams are working across the city. We are trying to remove them at the earliest.”Chopped trees lying by the roadside pose a challenge to vehicles and pedestrians, according to many. At a few places, tree branches have blocked half the width of the road.At the crossing of Gariahat Road and Mandeville Gardens, a chopped tree has been lying on the northern flank of Mandeville Gardens, towards the boundary of the Industrial Training Institute. The road is a two-way one but vehicles at present cannot move in opposite directions.Vehicles have to wait on one side till the queue on the other gets cleared. “The queue of vehicles headed towards Ballygunge goes past the crossing of Gariahat Road and Mandeville Gardens,” the Kasba resident said.Civic workers are clearing chopped-off branches lying by the roadside, a CMC official said. Many are still lying though, because of the “enormity of the devastation caused by the cyclone”, the official said.Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators, had said more than 5,000 trees in the city had been felled by the cyclone. He later revised the count to 15,000.",2020-02-06 20:29:00
70,Subhajoy Roy,CMC to auction logs and branches of trees felled by Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal - Telegraph India,"The civic body will auction logs and branches of trees felled by Cyclone Amphan and has started segregating timber from firewood, officials said.The chopped-off trees and their branches are now being stacked in three places — Tallah Park in north Calcutta, the road between the Milan Mela ground and ITC Sonar in east Calcutta and a ground opposite Nature Park near Taratala, in south Calcutta.A CMC official said the three spots had been identified for logs and branches as the Dhapa landfill site, where Calcutta’s solid waste is dumped, is brimming.“Once the timber is segregated and auctioned, the remaining portion — the firewood — can be auctioned separately and sent to Dhapa if there are no takers,” the official said. “We have started an inspection to draw up a list of the trees that fell. Our horticulturists and botanists are doing the job. We will start the auction after the list is ready.”A naturalist said 5,000 trees could yield around 100 tonnes of wood.A mahogany tree that fell near a club in Ballygunge will be auctioned soon, the official added.Tree specialists said both timber and firewood could have takers. Onkar Nath Maurya, a scientist with the Botanical Survey of India (BSI), said firewood was still in demand in rural areas. Firewood is also used to make furniture, though the quality may not be good.“Mahogany and neem are used to make quality furniture. Those trees can fetch good prices,” Maurya said.Naturalist Arjan Basu Roy said almost all kinds of trees were felled by Amphan in Calcutta. Among the trees that fell are banyan, radhachura, krishnachura, teak and sissoo. “The roots of the trees could not spread because of the concrete near the base. That could be a reason why they fell in large numbers,” he said.Chopped-off branches and trunks have not been cleared from roads in many places. A CMC official said one reason why it was taking so much time was unavailability of open trucks.Also, the trees fell with cables tied to them. In some places they fell with walls. The cables and concrete-bricks have to be removed before then trees can be transported.",2020-02-06 20:30:00

The tests were earlier scheduled for June 29, July 2 and 6.The schedule had to be revised because the lockdown in the containment zones is to continue till June 30 and it is unclear whether Metro and suburban train services will resume by then.“Several examinees had approached us with queries on whether they would face difficulties in reaching the exam venues on June 29.... So, we have decided to schedule the pending HS papers for July 2, 6 and 8,” said Chatterjee.Nearly 116 schools where the HS exams are supposed to be conducted have been damaged by Cyclone Amphan and need to be repaired.

Also, some students do not have access to Net connectivity; so, exams cannot be held online, an institute official said.Fifty per cent weightage in theory papers will be given based on the semester grade point average (SGPA) of previous semesters. The best performance in the semesters will be taken into account, the official said.Thirty per cent weightage will be given from the mid-semester exams that were held prior to the dissolution of classes in the third week of March. “The rest will be based on assignments/class tests,” the official said.The IIEST senate had held an emergency meeting on Saturday and decided on the mechanism.Students who have supplementary papers will be promoted to the next semester but they will have to take the supplementary exams, the official said. In lab-based papers, 50 per cent weightage will be given on the best performance in previous semesters and the rest on internal assessment, comprising viva voce. The viva voce will be held online (video conference) or over phone, depending on the connectivity a student has, IIEST director Parthasarathi Chakrabarty said.“If a student does not have Net connectivity to attend the viva-voce online (since some students come from rural areas and Cyclone Amphan has severely damaged network in those areas), the assessment will be done over phone,” Chakrabarty said.At the Shibpur institute 50 per cent of the seats are filled by students from outside Bengal, like it happens in the NITs.

75,Monalisa Chaudhuri,ATM break-ins: mask hurdle for police - Telegraph India,"There were break-in attempts at two ATM kiosks in the city and CCTV cameras had captured pictures of the culprits. But police could not identify them because of their face masks.It is now mandatory to wear a mask in public because of the coronavirus pandemic.Both break-in attempts in the past few days had failed but cops are worried about the difficulty masks pose in identifying criminals, the police said.“Earlier, it was rare to find someone in a mask trying such ATM break-ins. Even if someone did try, he/she could be identified by scanning footage of various CCTVs because at some point he/she would have removed the mask,” a city police officer said.In these two break-ins, the CCTV footage could not help identify the masked men, the officer said.Earlier, it would have been odd if someone wore a mask after committing a crime or attempting to do so. So, the person would have done away with the mask once he/she was on the road, the officer said.One of the break-in attempts was in the Hare Street police station area while the other was in the Burtolla police station area.In both cases, a man had entered the kiosk and tried to break into the machine but failed. The ATM kiosks of Andhra Bank near India Exchange Place and Central Bank of India in Gauribari Lane in Ultadanga did not have security guards but the alarms at both kiosks went off the moment someone tried to break into the machines, the police said.CCTV cameras have been instrumental in detecting several crimes in the past like that of capturing the faces of Russian nationals — suspected to be involved in ATM skimming scam — at ATM kiosks.  Using cameras to identify people involved in snatching, burglary and theft or rioting, arson and damaging public property is common. “CCTV grabs played crucial roles in identifying the people involved in smashing the bust of Vidyasagar at Vidyasagar College,” an officer said.The incidence of “traditional” crimes that had dipped during the lockdown will gradually rise as more people step out on the roads, according to some police officers.It will be a challenge to identify suspects in a sea of people wearing masks, an officer said. Preparing sketches of suspects will be difficult in future, another officer said.",2020-02-06 21:04:00
76,Anasuya Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Science City seeks Rs 7.5cr - Telegraph India,"Science City, Kolkata, has for the first time sought a special fund of Rs 7.5 crore from the Union culture ministry to pay members of its staff salaries and bear maintenance costs during the pandemic.All avenues of revenue generation have stopped for Science City since the Centre announced the lockdown on March 23. Of all the Science Centres in the country, Science City, Kolkata, is the only one that used to be to be completely self-reliant and did not receive any funds or grants from the government.A unit of the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), an autonomous body of the Union culture ministry, Science City, Kolkata, is the largest science centre in the country. It was developed by the administrative ministry with a one-time capital grant. Science City somehow met its operational and maintenance costs from its own revenues.It earned about Rs 19-20 crore annually through ticket sales and rentals. The convention centre on the premises is given out on rent.The annual expenditure was around the same figure with not much left for savings, A.D. Choudhury, the director-general of the National Council of Science Museums, said. The lockdown has hit the science centre hard and it is the first time it has had to ask for money from the government.“The NCSM is with the culture ministry…. We have asked for a special grant from the ministry. We had a discussion at a meeting of our governing body and we decided to send a proposal to the ministry asking for Rs 7.5 crore,” Choudhury said.“This is mainly to meet salary expenses and maintenance costs. Employees of Science City are employees of NCSM… they are government employees and as such should receive their salaries from the government. It is only that till now Science City generated enough funds to pay its staff… the government did not have to spend money.”Choudhury said Science City “was 100 per cent self-reliant” and that he regretted not having saved some money for such a rainy day.Inaugurated on July 1, 1997, Science City consists of two facilities, the Science Centre and the Convention Centre. The Science Centre complex comprises Space Odyssey, Dynamotion, Science Exploration Hall, Maritime Centre, Earth Exploration Hall and a sprawling Science Park. It has recorded a footfall of more than 29.90 million to date. It was set up on a plot that was once used to dump garbage.The Convention Centre complex comprises the main auditorium with a seating capacity of 2,232, a mini auditorium (seating capacity 392), a seminar hall complex consisting of 11 halls (seating capacity ranges from 15 to 100), an indoor (270sq m) and an open air exhibition ground (20,000sq m).The centre is a major destination for conventions, conferences, AGMs, trade exhibitions and cultural programmes from which Science City has so far generated a sizeable income.Science City, Kolkata, is one of the foremost science centres built by NCSM and it has been instrumental in setting up 25 science centres, including those in the Northeast states and Raipur, Ranchi, Dharwad, Puducherry, and Kottayam among others.",2020-02-09 01:53:00
77,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Calcutta Municipal Corporation survey on comorbidity - Telegraph India,"A survey to identify Calcuttans with comorbidities, which make them more vulnerable to Covid-19, will begin next week.The civic body has set a target of two weeks to finish the door-to-door survey, a Calcutta Municipal Corporation official said.Close to 3,000 workers will be deployed in the Calcutta municipal area’s 144 wards for the survey. One person will visit one household, unlike in the case of dengue where two or three-member teams do the survey. This has been done to ensure faster coverage of 1 million households in the wards, the official said.At least 20 health workers in every ward will carry forms with them to mark if a respondent has kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, or is a diabetic, or suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), or is hypertensive or has tuberculosis. The health workers will not record any other detail. Their job will be restricted to only noting down if the respondent has any of the diseases, the official said.The medical officers, who are in charge of health services in the wards, will be trained later this week. They will then train the health workers who will carry out the door-to-door survey. “We will start the survey next week in all likelihood,” the official said.Twenty health workers in a ward will visit 20 households simultaneously. “We decided to send only one person to a house as that would leaves more people to visit more houses at the same time,” another official said.According to the bulletin on Covid-19 issued by the state health department, 86.8 per cent of the 3,228 people who died of Covid-19 till Monday had comorbidities. The bulletin mentioned that hypertension, COPD and diabetes were the three most common comorbidities among the dead.The data generated by the door-to-door survey will be digitised and can be accessed by the state health department and CMC doctors. When information about someone testing positive for Covid-19 reaches the borough health officer or the ward medical officer — both of whom are doctors — they will check the database to see if the person has comorbidities, the official said.“When someone with comorbidity tests positive, the medical officer of the ward will be extra cautious. In case it is found that the person aged over 70 and has multiple comorbidities, the medical officer may advise against home isolation and suggest the person to get admitted to hospital,” a CMC doctor said.The reaction to someone in their 30s and without any comorbidity will be different from someone in their 70s with comorbidities, the doctor said.“This is why the survey is important. We will get to know who has comorbidity and react accordingly. We will request everyone to be true while answering the questions and allow health workers to conduct the survey.”If any family member is not at home when a surveyor reaches the house, he/she will ask the others present details about that member, a CMC official said.A large number of people of Baruipur and its nearby areas had been infected with coronavirus over the past several weeks. “So we decided to open an isolation centre for the people of the locality,” said Reverend Paritosh Canning, bishop of the Calcutta diocese.The St. Stephen’s Covid-19 Isolation Centre is the first such centre to be run by the CNI. It has been set up at a hostel for students of a vocational training centre run by the CNI. The church has tied up with Peerless Hospital to provide medical supervision of the patients who will be staying in the centre, the bishop said.

78,Our Special Correspondent,"Scooterist comes under bus near Rabindra Sadan, dies - Telegraph India","A man riding a scooter was killed when he crashed into a bus while trying to overtake it from the left on Cathedral Road near Rabindra Sadan on Tuesday, police said.Aftab Siddiqui, 32, was wearing a helmet when he collided with the bus on the Santragachhi-Dharmatala route and skidded on the road while trying to overtake the bus from the left, the police said.“The accident occurred around 5.20pm. The bus driver did not realise someone had banged against the vehicle and he kept driving… the man came under the rear wheels of the bus,” a traffic police officer said.Siddiqui, who hailed from Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar district, was declared dead at SSKM Hospital.Officers of Hastings police station have seized the bus and arrested the driver. He has been booked for rash and negligent driving and causing death by negligence.The number of two-wheelers has gone up during the lockdown, according to the traffic police. “Everyone knows one should never overtake a vehicle from the left but in this case the scooterist did exactly that.

79,Debraj Mitra,"Unlock 4: Day 1 brings no cheer, hopes pinned on tipplers in Kolkata - Telegraph India","The bottle was uncorked in bars after more than five months on Tuesday.The first day was “nothing great” but owners hoped that serving alcohol would gradually improve footfall.Bars have to do with half the seating capacity and a much-reduced workforce. But the permission to serve liquor has brought a sense of relief and hope, several owners said.A veteran Park Street restaurateur was seen pouring whisky into four glasses around 3.30pm for patrons. A waiter had reached out for the bottle but was stopped by the owner.“This feels so good, so normal, so Park Street. I want to make many more drinks today,” said Pratap Daryani, the owner of Oasis.The reduced capacity meant space for 30 guests on the ground floor and 40 on the first floor. But only two tables were occupied — one on the first floor had two guests and one on the ground floor had one.Amishek Singh, a businessman from Tollygunge, was seated at a table on the ground floor with a drink. “I was waiting to have a drink and good lunch on Park Street. This is a shot at normal life, which has to go on,” Singh who had dropped in on his way back from meeting a client in Salt Lake said.Around 300m away, three tables were occupied in the sprawling dining area of Tung Fong. “This seems a lot… footfall was lean past month. There have been Saturdays and Sundays when only seven or eight tables were occupied throughout the day. We hope serving liquor improves footfall, at least marginally,” an employee said.Glass walls separating tables and alternate tables “reserved” —distancing steps that have been in place since restaurants reopened on June 8 — continued to be in place.Restaurants got the nod to reopen from June 8 but the lid on bottles had kept many establishments shut. A few watering holes were shut on Tuesday, too. But the owners said they were busy stocking up and would reopen soon.“The excise order came suddenly. We are stocking up and we will open tomorrow (Wednesday),” an official of Silver Grill, one of the places that were shut on Tuesday said.The price of alcohol remained unchanged at most of the places on Tuesday. Restaurateurs said they had to spend “30 per cent more” to procure stock from the West Bengal State Beverages Corporation but high prices at restaurants is fraught with risk of a further dip in footfall.A couple of bar owners said they had raised prices, but “marginally”.The dine-and-drink dens will not extend timings immediately. The usual closure time is 11pm. Some of the places wind up earlier as well.The resumption of bar services has instilled new hope in many employees who are on furlough or an unpaid leave. “I had called up my manager… he told me about the permission to serve liquor and said if things improve I might get back to work,” a resident of Uttarpara who used to work at a bar on Camac Street said.Some restaurant owners  said calling employees back to work right now was unlikely.“We were sinking. The nod to serve liquor has come as a much-needed lifeboat. The next few months will have to see a robust growth for us to plan anything,” a bar owner said.The extension of timings will help bring back some employees, another owner said. “It would mean multiple shifts and the need for more people.But in the current situation, no owner will be willing to pay extra to stay open late in the night,” he said.Gaurav Karnani, the owner of the Grid microbrewery in Topsia, said it was premature to comment on footfall on Day 1. “Evenings are the prime time for us. The next few days are very crucial and will help us gauge the mood of people,” he said.",2020-02-09 02:05:00
80,Mita Mukherjee,"ISC, ICSE improvement test plan in November - Telegraph India","The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations wants to hold improvement examinations for the ICSE and ISC candidates of the 2020 batch in November if the Covid-19 situation permits, a circular issued by council to the school heads said.If the pandemic does not allow the tests to be held in November, they will be held along with next year’s ICSE and ISC exams. For the compartmental exams, too, the council has taken a similar decision — they will be held in November, if possible, or with next year’s regular exams.“The improvement examinations (for the ICSE/ISC 2020 candidates awarded imputed marks) may be held in November 2020, along with the Compartmental Examinations, subject to the condition being conducive or may otherwise be held along with the regular examinations for the Year 2021,” a circular issued to the heads of all schools by the council said.The council this year had conducted the ICSE and ISC exams till March 18 and cancelled the remaining papers as a preventive measure against the spread of Covid-19. The council had formulated a scheme for assessing the examinees in the papers for which exams could not be held.The council had also said that it would conduct a fresh examination two to three months after publishing the ICSE and ISC results for the students who wanted to improve their marks. The ICSE/ISC 2020 results were declared on July 15.A student’s average marks in the best three papers and their marks in internal assessment, project work and practical in the pending papers were taken into account during the final assessment.The council in its circular on Tuesday extended the last date for the schools to submit the list of the students who will appear in next year’s ICSE and ISC exams from August 31 to September 15.The last date of registration of students of Classes IX and XI for appearing in the 2022 ICSE and ISC exams have been extended from August 31 to September 15.The dates have been extended because many principals had been complaining to the council that the schools were closed and they had not been able to collect the necessary information from students. The schools are required to deposit fees to the council at the time of submitting the confirmation and registration forms.Many schools have complained that a large number of students have not paid the tuition and other fees for several months. “The Council has received several emails from heads of schools regarding the general difficulty being faced by them to collate information and make payments for the Confirmation and registration of candidates for the 2021 & 2022 ICSE/ISC Examinations due to unprecedented situation created by Covid 19 pandemic. In view of the present situation the council has decided to review its earlier stand and to extend the dates...” the council circular said.",2020-02-09 02:07:00
81,Sanjay Mandal,Unlock 4: Chaos as 6-city flights resume in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Many passengers missed flights and many flights were delayed on Tuesday as chaos prevailed at the Calcutta airport on the first day of resumption of flights to and from six cities, including Delhi and Mumbai.Airport and airlines sources said there were huge queues in the morning and afternoon and passengers had to wait for even more than an hour at the gates to enter the terminal. Similar queues were seen at the security check-in counters, too. An IndiGo official said about 100 passengers missed their flights because they showed up at boarding gates late. Other airlines, too, said many passengers were unable to make it on time.“Most passengers will be accommodated on next day’s flight, scheduled for Thursday,” said an official of a private airline. He alleged that the airport authorities had failed to make enough arrangements despite knowing that the number of flights would go up on Tuesday.“There were no sanitisers at most points because refilling was not done at regular intervals,” the official said.   On the first day of resumption of flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur, 32 additional flights took off and an equal number arrived. Till Monday, 60 flights were taking off from Calcutta. On Tuesday, the count went up to 92.Asked about the long queues, airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya said: “The problem was that 60 per cent of the passengers did not do web check-in and so they had to be redirected to the airline counters. Also, they did not have smartphones and so lacked the Aragya Setu app. They had to go to the airline counters and fill in self-declaration forms. Also, there was congestion at the security check-in because many passengers were unable to place the boarding pass properly in front of the camera for scanning.”The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted the authorities to implement a minimum touch policy, which requires every passenger to place his or her boarding pass before the camera for security personnel to check it from a distance.Flights to Calcutta from the six cities were suspended on July 6, following a request from the state government, because of high Covid prevalence there. For now, the flights on the routes will be operating three days a week.From September 1 to 13, they will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. From September 14, they will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.",2020-02-09 02:09:00
82,Debraj Mitra,Unlock 4: Metro to meet Bengal government over resumption - Telegraph India,"A meeting between the state government and Metro officials on the resumption of commercial services is likely in the next two days following a prod from the railway ministry, railway officials said.The Bengal home secretary had written to the chairman of the railway board, seeking resumption of Metro and suburban train services in the state.“The board has asked Metro, Eastern and South-Eastern Railway officials to sit with the state government for possible resumption of services,” said a railway official. “The meeting is likely in one or two days.”Before meeting the Bengal administration, senior officials of Metro Railway on Tuesday held an “internal meeting” to discuss the modalities of possible resumption of services.A curtailed fleet and timing (a late start and early closure), access for only existing smart card users, the frequency between trains are some of the steps that Metro officials are likely to pitch at the meeting with state officials.An app for online recharge of smart cards has been in the works.Sources said 8am-to-8pm service, a 12-minute interval between trains and suspension of services on Sunday were some of the proposals discussed at Tuesday’s meeting.Indrani Banerjee, the Metro spokesperson, said: “No decision has been taken regarding the train timings or intervals. We plan to do away with tokens for now. Only existing smart card users can avail themselves of Metro services. When we meet the state government officials, the main focus areas would be social distancing and crowd control.”Metro officials have said more than once that the trains, stations and tunnels were ready for commercial services but crowd control and social distancing were the “real challenges”. The state machinery’s help is the key to meeting the challenges, they have said.Deploying RPF guards in coaches and seeking police help outside and inside the stations were some of the steps being considered by the authorities. The carrier used to run 288 trains before the services were stopped on March 23. Over six lakh people used to travel by Metro every day.“The number of trains in service will be reduced drastically,” said an official.The Union housing and urban affairs ministry is likely to come up with a set of guidelines for the resumption of Metro services across the country.The ministry has, in turn, asked for a set of standard operating procedures from all Metros in the country.Calcutta Metro, which is not a corporation, is still under the railways. But the carrier has sent a list of SOPs to the urban affairs ministry, said an official.“We are exploring many possibilities before resumption of services. Crowd control and maintaining social distance will take a lot of homework in coordination with the state government,” said Metro general manager Manoj Joshi.",2020-02-09 02:11:00
83,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus outbreak: Covid fear shows in JEE (Main) turnout - Telegraph India,"As many as 70 per cent of the students did not turn up on the first day of the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) in the two centres in Calcutta. Of the 2,623 students who were to appear for the exam on Tuesday at the two centres, only 771 turned up, said officials associated with the exams. The centres are TCS Gitobitan in Salt Lake and the Institute of Instrumentation & Metrology in Belghoria.The centre in Salt Lake had exams in two shifts and the one in Belghoria, about 15km north from the heart of Calcutta, had only one shift. In one of the shifts at the Salt Lake centre, more than 1,000 students did not turn up. Tuesday’s tests were for B.Planning and B.Arch. The JEE (Main), through which most engineering colleges admit students, will continue till the end of the week. Some students felt the exams should have been conducted in April, when there were far fewer Covid-19 patients. “There are so many cases around now. Hence, chances of contracting the virus are also more,” said Diya Mukherjee, who travelled from New Alipore to Salt Lake. “It is uncomfortable writing a test for three hours wearing a mask and gloves. The hands became greasy and there was the constant fear of infection at the back of my mind.”Diya, who was a student of Delhi Public School Ruby Park, appeared for the B.Arch exam on Tuesday but will not write Wednesday’s exam.“While I was coming out I saw many students waiting outside. I decided not to come back on Wednesday because there will be more candidates and greater risk,” she said. Some examinees complained about the quality of masks given at the exam centres. “What I usually wear is better than the one I was given at the centre,” an examinee said.Candidates arrived from across the city as well as several districts. Many had to shell out a substantial amount to reach the venue by hiring vehicles, while others had no option but to travel in crowded public vehicles. Candidate Rahul Kundu and his father started at dawn from Midnapore, took a bus to Howrah and then an app cab to Salt Lake.The Telegraph reported on Monday that some examinees had decided to stay away from JEE (Main) because of the fear of contracting Covid-19. Those who decided to appear in the exam were scrambling to hire vehicles so they could travel without exposing themselves to the risk of catching the coronavirus.But not everyone can stretch their limits, especially in the midst of a pandemic, and hire a vehicle. Vivekananda Kundu, who accompanied son Rahul to the Salt Lake exam centre, said the bus was crowded and they were exposed to the risk of infection.“No social distancing norms were being maintained on the bus. But we had no other option. It took us about four hours to reach Howrah,” said Vivekananda. The Kundus will spend Tuesday night at a hotel in Esplanade because Rahul has another exam on Wednesday. “He has been preparing for this exam and we did not want him to lose a year,” the father said.At the Salt Lake centre, announcements were being made to not crowd at the gate, maintain distance from one another and wear masks. The body temperature of every candidate was measured with a thermal scanner.“Fewer students came today compared to last year. More rooms have been allotted this time to maintain social distancing,” said an official at the centre. Students coming out of the centre said they were assigned alternate computers so a safe distance between two was maintained.",2020-02-09 02:14:00
84,Sudeshna Banerjee,New Town residents walled in during the Covid-19 lockdown - Telegraph India,"Red alertThe detection of the first Covid-19 positive case in Bengal on March 17 propelled preparedness to top gear. On March 20, Greenwood Park notified a ban on the entry of taxis and app cabs inside the complex. Milk, newspapers and couriered packets were also to be received at the main gate.At Hiland Woods, a wash basin was installed at the main gate on March 17. In the next few days, couriers were stopped from reaching resident doors, app cabs were refused entry except in case of senior citizens or those with luggage… “We have asked security guards not to speak to residents on the mobile phones of cabbies and use our intercom to verify the booking instead,” said Sayantan Das, director, Hiland Woods, Birch Hazel Association. They also decided to keep doors of public areas open with stoppers to rule out the need to touch door handles.At Akankha, World Health Organisation directives are being regularly posted on the notice board. Though all facilities are shut, the common areas are being sanitised. “Delivery at the doorstep is being allowed only for the elderly residents and for medicines,” said secretary of Akankha Krishnachura Apartment Owners Association Dibyendu Roy.The ban on receiving home delivery at the door has caused inconvenience but residents are bearing it. “This is the third delivery I am coming down to collect this morning,” said Reshma Prabhakar, walking to the main gate of Sunrise Point on March 21. “With the children staying at home, I have to buy things online,” she said, adding that she understood the need for restriction on visitors’ entry.Helping handWhat is a big relief for life in the high-rise complexes has turned into a major headache because of the lockdown — the dependence on a battalion of utility staff.With people being urged to stay at home and transport not available, the residents suddenly find themselves on their own.On their own“We had anticipated this situation even before the janata curfew was announced by the Prime Minister,” said Dhrubajyoti Basak, president of Greenwood Elements in Action Area 2D. “So we did a drill on March 22, the day of the curfew, asking the staff to stay away.” Ten residents’ association members and another 10 or so volunteers were divided into teams for duties as varied as housekeeping, pump, emergency lift, garbage clearance, security, accounting etc. “Most residents had no clue where the pump or the electric meter was. The day before, the volunteers were shown around by the staffers and garbage bins with wheels bought for this situation. The drill had to continue since the lockdown was imposed immediately afterwards.”Entry is being supervised by using an app called MyGate. “Earlier, when a visitor came, the security informed us. Now whoever is expecting visitors keeps the rest of us informed through the app or through a WhatsApp group created for the purpose. The person on duty can open the gate using a remote switch,” he explained.The month-end is requiring another chore to be performed - collection of common area maintenance funds. “Earlier, we had an accountant to do the collection and update it on the system. Now three of us are going door to door,” Basak said.They do have some help by way of four security guards and four housekeeping staffers who are staying on the premises. “But we are still needing about 24 volunteers to run the show. Volunteers are monitoring when everyone’s garbage is collected and drag the bin to where the NKDA collects it from,” he added.Uniworld City, with 51 inhabited towers and more than 2,450 occupied flats, possibly needs the biggest workforce. “Once the lockdown was announced, we took a call not to let either the domestic help or the utility staff enter. Those who wanted to retain their attendants were asked to house them at home,” said Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, a member of the Kolkata Uniworld City Apartment Owners’ Association board.A complex that is manned by 139 security guards now has barely 40 living in the complex clubhouse. Another 40 are staying in an adjoining barrack provided by the private security agency. “And since this is the start of the month, we have had to requisition the services of some of our accounts people as well. So that makes for another 30 or so living here in some unoccupied apartments. As for housekeeping staff, passes have been issued to about 45 who are locals. They are working three hours a day,” added Pradipta Dutta, another board member. “Even then, there was a shortage the other day and residents were asked to bring their garbage out to bins that have been placed outside each tower.” A kitchen has been set up to feed about 125 people every day. The board members are meeting through video conference daily to discuss and mitigate day-to-day issues.The complex has a reason to be on its toes. The first Covid-19 suspect of New Town was from here. “He had gone for a seminar to Dubai which someone from Hyderabad who later tested positive had also attended. He returned home on February 15 and was summoned for a test on March 5. Thankfully he was cleared. Had he got infected, it would have been straight to the quarantine centre for many of us as we had had a drink together just two days earlier,” laughed Dutta.Looking ahead“We do not know how long the lockdown will continue. It would depend on how the disease spreads and what steps the government takes to contain it. We can only do what is in our control. We should only think about that,” Basak of Greenwood Elements summed up the situation.Issue with visitorsThe threat of infection from residents coming from abroad has emerged as a major cause for concern. “We can no longer trust residents to voluntarily disclose if they are coming from abroad. We will have to ask the security guards to check the booties of each incoming car. The luggage should be an indicator of a return from a trip. Guests coming to any resident’s house must also notify if he is coming from outside the city. We are also planning to stop renting of premises to people from outside the state,” Sudipta Mukherjee, secretary of Greenwood Sonata, said in an agitated voice while speaking to The Telegraph Salt Lake on March 18, the day after the state’s first Covid-19 patient was detected.In the days to follow, the police also mandated that the housing committees keep the local thanas informed about all residents coming from abroad.“We have two residents who came recently from the UK and Bangladesh. We are keeping an eye out whether they are serving the quarantine period at home or not. We are recording even the domestic arrivals,” said Gobinda Biswas, secretary of Sunrise Point.“Someone here has come from the UK 10 days ago. He stays alone. We are offering him support for basic needs,” said Roy of Akankha Krishnachura.At Hiland Woods, two residents recently returned from the US. “The health department calls them daily to ensure they stay home for 14 days,” said Das.There was tension in a couple of complexes over residents coming from abroad being spotted outside before the quarantine period got over. In one case, the police had to intervene.Such concerns spilled over to resident groups on social media as well. Some sought suggestions as to whether immediate family members of those quarantined at home should be allowed to come out or discussed risks posed by pilots or air hostesses residing in the complex.Residents of New Town complexes have turned their premises into fortresses in a bid to guard against Covid-19. The high-rise committees have come up with stringent rules of entry as well as ways of sanitation. Operation cleanIt all started even before the first Covid-19 positive case was detected in Bengal. On March 15, Greenwood Sonata in Action Area 2D behind City Centre 2, shut all common areas like its swimming pool, children’s room, lounge and gym. A five litre jar of sanitiser was procured and orders placed for more as also for masks for all the security personnel.  At Uniworld City, both clubs were shut the same day. So were all recreational facilities like library, swimming pool and gym. Daily helps coming in were asked at the gate to sanitise their hands. Greenwood Park in Action Area 1 had more on their plate than their own complex — a community market and the ATM inside it. “We held an emergency meeting in the evening on March 14. By March 16, wash basins were installed at both our gates as well as at The gate of Eden Shop, which is under our management. Since the market and the ATM cater to the entire neighbourhood, long queues formed at the entry for hand washing. So we had to install a second basin there. Hourly disinfection of the elevators too started at the same time,” Biplab Basu, secretary, Greenwood Park, said.  Committee members at Sunrise Point engaged in hurried discussions to put a regimen in place. “We have managed to procure 10 bottles of industrial grade sanitiser with 99.9% alcohol after checking in about 20 places,” said Parminder Rana, president, Sunrise Point Apartment Owners Association. “The scarcity was so much that we saw two women buying aftershave lotions at one shop, possibly to use as disinfectant.” The swimming pool which was supposed to reopen on March 15 will stay dry indefinitely.",2020-03-04 16:02:00
85,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: South Pointers deliver medicines and more at doorstep - Telegraph India,"They walked out of classrooms years ago but the bond forged on campus is as strong as ever. Former students of South Point School have taken it upon themselves to ensure that their retired teachers do not stay unattended during the lockdown.Pointers Who Care, an alumni initiative formed in 2009, has been doing the rounds, delivering medicines and groceries, withdrawing cash from banks and more.“We have 228 teachers on our database to whom we provide three kinds of services round the year — medical, financial and emotional. In this period, some of them are in dire need of the first. Their neighbourhood grocery or medicine shops are not delivering at home. Anticipating this crisis, 40 of us volunteers took turns to call up the teachers and check if they needed help,” said Anupam Sen, the secretary of the organisation and 1981 Madhyamik passout.The biggest requirement was of medicines. “We identified a Pointer from the 1983 Madhyamik batch who owns a medicine shop opposite Lake Market. The lists were WhatsApped to him and he kept everything packed for us to pick up. He even arranged for the medicines that he could not supply initially and delivered them today,” said Sen, who did the rounds last Saturday with schoolmates Nivedita Roy Burman and Rajib Sarkar. “We had stickers on our car windshields that said Emergency Medicine, so police did not stop us.”Get Well, the chemist shop run by Sarbajit Ghatak, has mostly suspended its home delivery service. “I am operating with reduced manpower. Moreover, supply was drying up last week, when I was approached. But I gathered whatever was in my stock,” he said. One of the teachers, Dipali Sinha Roy, who used to teach Bengali, called to thank Ghatak on receiving the medicines. “It felt good to have been of some service to them,” he smiled. Roy Burman, who delivered in the Jodhpur Park area, did not step into the houses of teachers. “I was wearing a mask and gloves and delivered at the door, with minimal interaction as I did not want to expose them to any risk,” said the geography teacher at Shri Shikshayatan College, who stays near Navina cinema.The teachers could not be more thankful for the initiative of their one-time students.  “I had about 10 days of medicines left when the lockdown was announced. The neighbourhood chemist was shut. As I stay alone, I was tense about running out of blood sugar and pressure medicines when their call came. They are always by our side. When I had fractured my hand some years ago, they had taken me to the doctor, too. I have two months of supply now,” said Sanghamitra Dasgupta. The 80-year-old English teacher retired in 2000.Anindita Sen, 71, received a medicine that was missing in the first lot delivered by Roy Barman from Ghatak on Friday. “It was a medicine for a nerve disorder for my husband. I have not heard of students of any other school being this mindful of their former teachers,” said Sen, whose daughters stay out of town.Pointers Who Care has been holding medical camps annually with alumni doctors as well as two social gatherings. The service during lockdown is out of their calendar of events. “We are doing for our teachers what we are doing for our elderly relatives too. They must not be out on the streets in this situation,” said Roy Barman.",2020-03-04 20:56:00

88,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: ICMR nod for 4 more hospitals in Bengal to carry out Covid-19 test - Telegraph India,"Four more hospitals in Bengal have received the Indian Council of Medical Research’s permission to conduct tests for Covid-19.The tests are unlikely to begin soon, though, for want of test kits, officials in these hospitals said on Friday.The ICMR, India’s apex biomedical research body, has announced the names of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital near Shyambazar and Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute at Hazra in Calcutta and Malda Medical College and Hospital and Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital in the districts.An official from one of these hospitals said the authorities were trying to start tests from next week but officials from the others said it was difficult to commit a date.Only five hospitals — three in Calcutta — in the state are currently doing tests for Covid-19. The Centre-run National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) and the state-run SSKM Hospital and School of Tropical Medicine are conducting tests in the city. In the districts, North Bengal Medical College and Hospital and Midnapore Medical College and Hospital are conducting tests.Two private hospitals in Calcutta — Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and Tata Medical Center — have received the ICMR nod to conduct tests. But neither has been able to start.An official of Apollo said test kits were still to arrive.The ICMR authorities have said that RG Kar, Malda and Murshidabad medical colleges will get test kits from them and not Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute. Various components needed to test samples will be provided by the state government, officials of these hospitals said.“We have to procure it from the market. Kits will be available in the market. But I do not think we will be able to begin tests before the lockdown is lifted,” an official of the cancer institute said. “Since goods movement has been hit, procuring items needed for tests is proving to be difficult.”An official of Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital said authorities were “trying their best to start tests from next week”. An official at RG Kar said “they were ready with 80 per cent of the preparations” but could not commit a date when tests would start.A public health specialist said the state and the Centre should sort out hurdles in procuring kits and other stuff needed to conduct tests. “If the number of suspects increases, we cannot afford to wait,” the specialist said.The three medical colleges are also virus research and diagnostic labs (VRDLs) that receive special funding from the Centre to research viral diseases. A health department official said the VRDLs would be in position to conduct more tests because of their infrastructure advantage. They have dedicated scientists for such tests, the official said.These labs are approved under the department of health research for “Establishment of a Network of Laboratories for Managing Epidemics and Natural Calamities”, according to the ICMR website.",2020-03-04 20:57:00
89,Our Special Correspondent,Madhyamik classes on DD Bangla  - Telegraph India,"The state government will start virtual classes for students of classes IX to XII in state-aided Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools from April 7, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Friday.The classes will be held through a programme to be telecast on DD Bangla from 4pm to 5pm. Teachers of various subjects will discuss a particular topic every day in the classes, which will continue till April 13.Students will be allowed to ask questions through email, WhatsApp or over phone.At the end of each class, students will be assigned activities. The homework will have to be submitted to teachers once schools reopen, Chatterjee said. “The schools are closed. But we need to make sure that academic activities continue. We will start virtual classes to make up for the lost time,” Chatterjee said.Students between Classes I and VIII in state-aided primary and secondary schools will also be assigned activities to be done at home during the lockdown. The details of the assignments for classes I to VIII can be downloaded from https://banglarshiksha.gov.in from April 6.Teachers have been asked to contact students through phone, email or WhatsApp and help them complete the tasks, Chatterjee said.",2020-03-04 20:58:00
90,Pranesh Sarkar,MR Bangur for coronavirus: Mamata Banerjee - Telegraph India,"MR Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge will be converted into a specialised hospital for treatment of coronavirus patients, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday.“Existing patients of the hospital will be shifted to SSKM and Sambhunath Pandit hospitals,” Mamata said at Nabanna while making the announcement.Initially, it was decided that Calcutta Medical College and Hospital will be converted into a dedicated hospital to treat coronavirus patients but the decision was changed because of some “technical” reasons, a health department official said. “Another dedicated hospital for Covid-19 patients was needed in Calcutta after the Beleghata ID hospital. We can accommodate a little over 100 patients at Beleghata.”Once the Beleghata ID hospital is filled to capacity, patients will be admitted to MR Bangur hospital. “We can still admit some more patients at the Beleghata hospital; so, we will get some time to ready MR Bangur Hospital,” the health department official said. “In case of coronavirus, every patient needs an isolated bed. So, even a large hospital can admit a limited number of patients.”Police said 150 nurses of MR Bangur and its members of the contractual staff agitated on the hospital compound on Friday morning to protest the government’s decision to turn it into a dedicated hospital for coronavirus patients.The agitation started around 9.50am, an officer of Jadavpur police station said. “Around 3pm, the entire crowd had dispersed. The hospital authorities later spoke to them.”“We have to ready everything in a few days. If the number of positive cases rises in the state, Calcutta may record the most as it is the most exposed place in the state,” a state government official said.The chief minister said she was unhappy with the resistance in some areas. “One should realise we are setting up standalone Covid-19 hospitals. We are not setting up isolation wards in a hospital where other patients are undergoing treatment. It should be seen as a humanitarian approach as everybody has the right to get treatment,” the chief minister said while pointing out that the state had set up 59 standalone hospitals for Covid-19 patients.People should not oppose if a coronavirus patient’s body is taken to the local crematorium, she said. Speaking about Personal Protective Equipment, Mamata said: “We have ordered 900,000 PPEs, but received 167,000 so far… all have been sent to hospitals in the districts as well as in Calcutta. The government is trying within its limited resources.”",2020-03-04 20:58:00
91,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus outbreak: ICSE council order on promotion - Telegraph India,"The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations on Friday advised ICSE schools to follow the directives of the respective state governments in regard to promotion of all students from Classes I to VIII.The Bengal government has said all students from Class I to VIII in aided schools will be promoted this year. It, however, has not made it clear whether the order would apply to ICSE schools.The principal of an ICSE school in Calcutta said the council’s advisory was not likely to apply to schools in Bengal because most institutions had prepared the results of the annual exams.Most ICSE schools in Bengal had held their annual exams in February and prepared the report cards by March 16, the day the schools were closed down to contain the spread of the coronavirus.“In view of the... global spread of the Novel Corona Virus... some State Governments have issued directives to Schools in their respective States, regarding the promotion of all students of Classes I to VIII. You are hereby advised to kindly follow the directives of the State Government accordingly,” the council notice reads.“The schools have to follow the directive of the respective state governments,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the council.",2020-03-04 20:58:00
92,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Report sought on campus digital divide in Bengal - Telegraph India,"The higher education department has sought a report from vice-chancellors on the number of students attending online classes and those who are being left out because of lack of access to computers, an official said.Higher education secretary Manish Jain asked the VCs of state aided universities to submit a report through a questionnaire-based format by Friday.When contacted by The Telegraph, Jain declined to comment.The format contained questions such as the date of starting online classes, whether all subjects are being covered, plan for expansion if all subjects are not covered and response from students.The higher education department official who spoke to this newspaper said the government was worried about the fate of the students who were on the other side of the digital divide and not in a position to attend online classes.“We expect the VCs to share with us what percentage of the students they are being able to cater to through online platforms. Many students are from remote areas  which has limited or no internet connectivity. We want to know from the VCs how many students are left out from the digital platforms,” the official said.The Telegraph had on Friday reported that Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das had highlighted the issue of digital divide.JU vice-chancellor Das has asked teachers to be “cautious” about conducting online classes because “many students may not be able to afford a desktop computer or laptop at home, or may be staying in a remote village, with limited or no Internet connectivity”.A JU official said the university had informed the department that while a section of teachers was taking classes online, the authorities had not taken any decision on such classes.“Given the lack of access of a large number of students to computers, the university has not framed any policy on the matter,” the official said.Presidency vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia told Metro: “We have informed the department that a moderate section of students is attending online classes. We cannot claim that all students are attending the online platforms as our university, too, has students who come from villages that have limited or zero access to internet. The digital divide poses a challenge to reach out to them. We hope we would be able to reach out to them in consultation with the state government.Another official of the higher education department said they were thinking of reaching out to students with limited or no internet access through TV or radio.“Doordarshan, All India Radio broadcast programmes to remotest corners. The school education department has decided to host an hourly programme every day from April 7 to 13 on DD Bangla for the students of Classes IX to XII. Similar models can be tried out for college and university students,” the official said.Jadavpur VC Das welcomed such alternative models. “We would welcome if something on this line could be planned for college and the university students,” he said.",2020-03-04 20:58:00
96,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Think about then… and now: Why you must not crib - Telegraph India,"The city is under a blackout for fear of Chinese air strikes. Shops and offices are shut. Eight children in a joint family, living in a house on Fern Road in Ballygunge, spend their evenings playing carrom. In an adjoining room, the elders are glued to the radio, listening to the news or Binaca Geetmala presented by Ameen Sayani, a budding broadcaster then. Calcutta is again under a curfew. A young marketing executive with a paint manufacturer has to walk from a factory in Shalimar to Esplanade before he finds a bus to his Behala home. Most offices are shut for a few days. But adda continues behind half-downed shutters of tea stalls and local clubs. Television is still very much a rich man’s entertainment. Radio and books are for everybody. Lockdown 2020, novel coronavirusIn a New Alipore apartment, a 19-year-old girl is hooked to Hunters on Amazon Prime where Al Pacino, in his web series debut, plays a Holocaust survivor on the trail of Nazis in New York. In an adjacent room, his parents are shuffling between Indian and international news channels for updates on the Covid-19 toll. In the kitchen, her younger sister is making an Instagram post to let the world know that she has just baked her first brownie. If the tenure of the current lockdown is unprecedented, so is the “can-do list” for some of the people confined in their homes.There is a bouquet of online streaming platforms, waiting to deliver content according to your choice. If gangster flicks are your dope, tune in to Peaky Blinders on Netflix, which traces the rise of the Shelby clan in post-World War I England, led by a deliciously dangerous Cillian Murphy. Love desi stuff? Catch up on Kay Kay Menon as an intel boss leading a 19-year manhunt for a dreaded terror mastermind in Special Ops on Hotstar.Music lovers are not to be left behind. Singer Ozzy Osbourne is back with Ordinary Man, his first solo album in a decade. The album is playing on the loop in the systems of many, thanks to the likes of Spotify, a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service that gives users access to millions of songs from artistes all over the world.Thrown into the mix are several social networking apps for group video calls. “I was studying in Delhi during the 1984 Sikh riots. From Calcutta, my father used to book lightning trunk calls (that connected on an urgent basis and cost around eight times the normal rate) and talk to me on my landlord’s landline number,” said Niladri Mitra, who retired from a PSU manufacturing company.Mitra has been talking to his son, who works in Illinois, at least once a day for the past two weeks. The video call enables Mitra, seated in his drawing room in Salt Lake, to see his son every day. “He even gets chided by his mother for not cleaning his room,” said Mitra.The evolution of curfew was not lost on senior citizens. Sandhya Ghosh, in her mid-seventies, was posted at the Park Circus branch of a nationalised bank during the 1984 violence and lockdown. “A police officer came to our branch and cautioned against overcrowding. But the customers were panic-stricken and there was a huge rush,” remembered Ghosh, who now lives in Singhi Park.The bank nearest to her home has remained shut for the past few days. But that has not stopped her from paying the monthly bills via e-wallets.Ghosh was a college student during the China war of 1962. “We cousins played cards and carrom and got an occasional chance to tune in to the radio in the presence of seniors. Hindi songs were a strict no-no,” she said.Cut to 2020.Now, WhatsApp groups are teeming with messages — what to watch on different platforms.“City on a hill — done. Special Ops — done. Laal Kaptaan — done. Ebar ki dekhbo (What to watch now)? Please suggest,” read a message posted on a WhatsApp group of friends, all former room-mates in Bangalore and now settled in different parts of the country.The message was posted at 12.31pm on March 25. Within 15 minutes, there were over 50 messages and a mini war of words on how good or bad a series was. “If you haven’t, please watch Mirzapur,” said a member of the group.Another member’s reply: “Going by your love for mediocre content, you will love it. But since this (lockdown) is also a chance to engage your mind, I would suggest Better Call Saul (an American crime drama series). One of the best ever.”There are apps like Houseparty, whose popularity has soared as millions around the world are in self-isolation. The video-calling app lets you chat with friends, play games and much more.While teachers are conducting online classes and assignments, the young girls and boys know how to find their “us time”.In school, the “us time” meant intervals between two classes. In the virtual world, it has remained so.“We log on to the online app before the scheduled time and chat with one another. It is so spontaneous. Someone might have just woken up and someone might have run straight out of the bathroom after washing the hair. This is the ‘us time’. Ditto for the time we get in between classes when one teacher has left and the other is yet to arrive,” said a Class XI student of the reputable school. Not that everyone can afford the options that a modern home offers. Life is still a torture in one-room hutments in large parts of the city, already crammed and made more stifling by the rising temperature and the need to stay indoors.Author Mani Shankar Mukherjee, a chronicler of Calcutta and better known as Shankar, said the current lockdown was unprecedented on two counts. “The duration of the lockdown is something the city, or India, has never seen. Earlier shutdowns lasted for a few days. The other stark difference is social distancing. During earlier lockdowns, there was a fear of life but because of violence. People sought comfort in each other, whenever possible, during crisis. But now, people are weary of coming too close to each other,” said Shankar.Anupam Majumdar, in his seventies now, spoke in the same vein about earlier shutdowns. Majumdar had walked from a factory in Shalimar to Esplanade to board a bus to Behala on the day Indira Gandhi was killed.“Over the next few days, most offices were shut. But in para clubs and tea stalls, people like us met for a daily dose of adda behind half-downed shutters,” he said.But during the current lockdown, Majumdar has not been able to see his son, who lives in a housing complex in Panchasayar, also the home of Bengal’s first confirmed Covid-19 patient. Majumdar is asthmatic and his son “did not want to take any risk”.Asked about his take on the evolution of lockdown and the plenty of options available now, veteran author Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay put things in perspective.“I don’t think the number of options in the real or virtual world matter when there is a compulsion. People, young or old, know they are confined within the four walls. Whatever they do to kill time, they know they are doing it because of lack of other options. There is disease, death and gloom outside. Playing an online game now and during normal circumstances are not the same thing,” he said.Reeta Bose, who spent her working life in Mumbai with the Reserve Bank of India, settled down in Calcutta post-retirement. She lived through the riots following the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6, 1992.“During the riots, there was a similar shutdown. Everything was closed. There was little to do. Read a book, watch TV,” she remembered.In lockdown 2020, Bose has been quite busy. She has just finished watching Tokyo Trials — based on the international tribunal held by the Allied Forces at the end of World War II that tried and sentenced Japanese leaders for war crimes — on Netflix.Bose, who did her master’s in mathematics from Calcutta University, also takes regular classes on an online math tutoring programme for school students. “I don’t realise how the day goes by,” she said.But this is not how she had planned the summer. Next month, she was supposed to have been on Isle of Man, to be by the side of her daughter, who is expecting her first baby.“Some things are not meant to be,” she rued.",2020-03-04 20:59:00
97,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Role reversal in virtual class around Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A group of Class XII students were attending an English class, but the teacher was not sure how many of them had logged in for the class. A student showed the teacher how he could track the number of students online.A teacher taking a psychology class felt disturbed by the background noise.  A student suggested that he ask all participants to mute the audio. Schools have asked teachers to conduct online classes but many of them are struggling to find their way with the tech tools. Coming to their rescue are students or their teenage sons and daughters.Be it uploading content, tracking students or conducting a glitch-free class, it has not been easy for many teachers. “Whenever there is a problem, students turn teachers and help,” said Anuradha Das, the director of Garden High International School. Students are not the only ones offering help. Mayukhi Ghosh was woken up by her mother in the middle of the night because she was unable to upload assignments. “One day my mother woke me up at 2am to upload some content. I have helped her create Google classrooms and set up assignments that can be uploaded,” said the Class XII student of Modern High School for Girls. Mother Nupur Ghosh is slowly becoming a pro. “I am using Google classroom and my daughter showed me how to track students. When I was uploading storytelling content for Class VI, she taught me how to add an audio clip to a presentation,” the vice-principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy said.In some schools, teachers are being trained in the know-how of technology but it is not always enough and some of them said it’s only when they take a class that the hiccups start surfacing. “The young teachers do not find it that difficult but it is not so easy for those in their late 40s and 50s. It takes time to get familiar,” said a 47-year-old teacher of a south Calcutta school. When a group of students logged in for a virtual class on Friday, the ambient noise was too loud. “We told Sir to ask everyone to mute their microphones while listening to the lecture and switch it on only when they have a question,” said Class XII student Chandra Bhushan Ray.Teacher Biswajit Majumdar was able to take the rest of the class peacefully. “It’s a different experience from what I have had so far in class,” said the head of the department of English at MC Kejriwal Vidyapith.In one of his classes, some students could not connect because of weak Wi-Fi and one of them suggested the lecture could be recorded and sent to them instead of the class being cancelled. “My friends and I suggested to our teacher to use the web version of WhatsApp to make it easier for them to check assignments instead of reading it on a mobile screen,” said Arjesh Gupta, a Class XII (A2) student of Garden High International School.",2020-03-04 20:59:00
98,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus pandemic: Ventilators, isolation beds at private hubs around Calcutta - Telegraph India","Over 150 beds for isolation patients and around 550 ventilators will be available across private health facilities in and around Calcutta for Covid-19 patients, health department officials said on Friday.While a few of the private hospitals have started admitting patients testing positive for the disease, some others will do so from next week, the officials said.The state government will refer patients to the private hospitals but they can also admit patients on their own.“We have a dedicated elevator for Covid-19 patients. The elevator is programmed in a way that it would stop only at the floor where an isolation ward for such patients has been set up. In the emergency room, such patients will be kept separated from others,” said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Group of Hospitals.At the RN Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences, the isolation ward for patients testing positive for the coronavirus has been set up on the ground floor.“We have a 5-bed triaging and isolation ward for suspected patients . The unit has dedicated ventilators and monitors and all necessary protective equipment,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, of which RN Tagore hospital is the flagship unit.On March 19, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had appealed to private hospitals to join the Covid-19 fight by creating isolation beds and, if possible, lend doctors during emergency. She had met representatives of several hospitals at a meeting in Nabanna, which was also attended by officials of the health and other departments.“During our interaction with the chief minister, we had promised to allocate beds for treatment of coronavirus patients,” said Rupak Barua, the chief executive officer of the AMRI group of hospitals.From Saturday, AMRI Salt Lake would throw open nine floors of its annex, with 52 beds, for critically ill Covid-19 patients. Health department officials discussed the modalities of admission with AMRI officials on Friday.Pradip Tondon, the CEO of Belle Vue Clinic, said: “We have scattered the isolation beds across different floors where extreme care has been taken to ensure there is complete dissociation of other patients and doctors with those admitted here.”Representatives of at least 26 private hospitals have told the health department that they were ready with ventilators and other gadgets to treat coronavirus patients, in accordance with an advisory issued by the state government. The advisory has laid down how an isolation ward should be ready with electrical points to install ventilators and other gadgets.",2020-03-04 20:59:00
99,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus outbreak: All-faith group gives food to the needy in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Over 2,000 people who have been deprived of daily earnings because of the lockdown were on Friday given a week’s ration by an all-faith network.The people who got the ration were rickshaw-pullers, mutiyas (people who ferry load on vans or on their backs), workers at closed fast-food stalls and others. They were from different faiths but were united in loss of livelihood and had families staring at starvation.The givers, like the receivers, were also made up of people from different faiths. The aid was organised by the United Interfaith Foundation India, which comprises social workers and leaders from multiple religions.The distribution of the ration happened in two phases on Friday. The first lot was distributed from the Burhani Mosque, run by the Dawoodi Bohra community, in Topsia. The second round happened on Zakaria Street, in front of Nakhoda Mosque.Archbishop Thomas D’Souza of the archdiocese of Calcutta; Moulana Md. Shafique, the imam of Nakhoda Masjid; and Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, the general secretary of the United Interfaith Foundation, were among the leaders who distributed cereals and pulses to the needy.A pack contained two kilos each of rice and potato, one-and-a-half kilos of onion, a kilo of daal, 500gm oil and a pack of biscuits.At both spots, a long queue of people waited to receive the ration. But everyone maintained social distancing and stood inside white circles drawn with chalk on the road. Most of the givers and takers wore masks. Some of the givers wore gloves, too.“The stuff should last for a week. We will give fresh stock after that. This will continue till the lockdown is lifted,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, general secretary of the foundation.“We can do our bit by being present and reaching out. Though it is not a lot but something. It is not easy for people to come out because of the other restrictions during the lockdown and social distancing has to be maintained,” said archbishop Thomas D’Souza.The network of volunteers of the foundation had done a detailed profiling of the people in several localities to prepare a list of close to 5,000 recipients. “Over 2,000 got the ration on Friday and the rest will get it tomorrow from Gurdwara Behala and another spot,” said an organiser.He said the reach of different religious leaders in their respective areas was extremely helpful in preparing the list.“Several festivals, like Mahavir Jayanti, Shab-e-Barat, Easter, Baisakhi and the Bengali New Year are coming up. We requested all the people who got ration today to celebrate these festivals inside their homes and not step out,” said Ahluwalia.“In today’s circumstances, where daily wage earners have no livelihood, we urge the privileged to share with their brethren with an open heart,” said Taher Faizuilabhoy, secretary of the Dawoodi Bohra Jamaat Trust of Calcutta.",2020-03-04 20:59:00

101,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Schools of Calcutta plan for uncharted days - Telegraph India,"Schools in the city are preparing for changes that they will have to implement to maintain social distancing whenever the government allows them to resume classes on campus.Reducing the strength of a class by half and live streaming lectures to the other half who will be at home, introducing shifts and staggering break timings are some of the measures the schools are contemplating.Many of them believe masks and gloves will become part of the uniform and thermal (infrared) guns, which check body temperature, will be part of the school infrastructure. Besides, it will be mandatory to carry hand sanitisers The first thing that most school heads are thinking about is reducing the strength of the class to almost half the number each day, so that all students do not have to turn up simultaneously. That will also prevent crowding on the buses in which they commute. But attending school three days a week will not be enough to compensate for the classes lost because of the lockdown, and many institutions are thinking of continuing with online sessions they had started last month. “Our technical team is looking into options as to how best the classes can be live streamed for the students who are at home on a particular day. Else, the syllabus will move at a snail's pace. Those at home will have to follow the same timetable,” said Sharmila Bose, the principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ High School. The principal of Apeejay Schools in Park Street and Salt Lake is pondering similar changes, as part of which a section of teachers will have to be kept free to take online classes. Heritage School principal Seema Sapru feels schools will have to follow a “hybrid model of online and offline classes”.“Schools will have to be less rigid about the structure, reinvent and design school spaces in a way to prevent crowding and contact,” said Devi Kar, the director of Modern High School for Girls.“We cannot replace in-person thing completely but there is no harm in having a blend.”Kar said the entire class would not be expected to do the same thing at the same time.The schools are grappling with the problem arising out of the fact that not every student has a computer at home and hence, is not in a position to attend online classes. Some of them also said that schools might have to operate in shifts. “We have been suddenly thrown off our feet and we will have to make changes in our system. I have discussed it with my teachers and asked them to come up with ideas. One of the things we might have to think about is operating in shifts for the same strength of children. This would mean longer hours for teachers and shorter for children,” said John Bagul, the principal of South City International School. Break time and dispersal and entry will also have to be staggered, else the whole purpose of operating in shifts will be defeated, teachers pointed out. Bagul said the assemblies in the morning would have to be replaced by announcements over the public address system.“There will have to be strict instructions for parents that they cannot send their children to school if they have the slightest cough or cold. There will have to be screening for body temperature at the entry to the school. Those found running a temperature will not be allowed to step into the campus,” said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James’ School.Many teachers think that what has come to be regarded as social norms on campuses will have to be abandoned in the post-Covid-19 era, to ensure protection from the virus. No more hugging the teacher, said one.“We have always told our children to share something that they learn in school. But now we will have to tell them no more sharing the tiffin. Social values will have to change in the new set-up,” said Reeta Chatterjee, the principal of the Apeejay Schools.",2020-03-05 00:33:00

The accused has been identified as Mohammad Shakib.On April 28, around 200 men had attacked policemen in uniform with stones and damaged at least two police vehicles when the cops had tried to enforce the lockdown. Two of the injured cops had reportedly been seriously injured. Police have slapped IPC sections related to rioting, disobedience of order duly promulgated by a public servant and voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, as well as under the prevention to damage of public property act and the disaster management act.The 12 people who had been arrested earlier in this case are in judicial custody.“Search is on for the other accused.

103,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: IIT students’ pocket money helps community - Telegraph India,"Students of IIT Kharagpur have saved their pocket money to reach food and ration to villagers around the campus, many of them jobless during the lockdown.The students, many of whom have gone back home since the lockdown started, took to crowdfunding after coming to know that many people living on and around the campus were having problems getting their basic essentials.They had the fund transferred through a digital wallet to officials of Gopali Youth Welfare Society, an organisation of about hundred IIT students that was started in 2002 for the welfare of the people in the area.Some officials of the Gopali gram panchayat, about 3km from the IIT campus, are associated with the society.“Many of the villagers depend on the campus to earn their livelihood. Now as the campus is shut, their earnings have taken a hit. As we came to know about their plight, we decided to chip in. We take help from them. It is our turn to help them out,” said Dasari Sai Nishanth, a second-year student of electrical engineering.The beneficiaries include daily wage earners working in various eateries, ward boys in hostels, washermen, rickshaw-pullers, domestic help and workers in construction sites on the 2,100-acre campus.The IIT-Kharagpur alumni based in the US have already reached out to these people.Help in the form of essentials is being disbursed from the main gate of the IIT.“Given the extent of the crisis, we think help should be extended from as many quarters as possible,” said Dasari.Gopali Youth Welfare Society collaborated with the gram panchayat to create a team of 15-20 volunteers. They distributed essential items to around 2,000 families under the Gopali gram panchayat.

Some of the institutions said sustaining themselves in the aftermath of a lockdown, with no guarantee when they could resume operations, would prove tough. Letters have already started coming in from some parents, saying they would no longer send their children.The owner of at least one preschool and daycare facility has decided to close one of its seven centres in the city. A school head said some parents are “quietly withdrawing”  their children without paying the fees. “A section of parents wrote to us, saying they are withdrawing their children. When we told them that if they come back they will have to take readmission, they said they were fine with it,” said Nabonita Bose Mukherjee, founder principal of Bubble Blue Montessori & Daycare. Bubble Blue, which has a daycare centre with each of its branches, will close the Narendrapur centre launched in August 2015. The school has three branches in New Town, two in Salt Lake and one in Jodhpur Park. Bose Mukherjee said if they did not shut down, it would be like “carrying a baggage”. Heads of schools said some parents were “sitting on the fence” and not communicating or paying the fees. With rents and salaries to be paid, the schools can sustain themselves from the reserves only for a while if fees are not received.Mongrace Montessori House and Day Care Centre in New Town has also received mails from companies putting on hold tie-ups for daycare facilities offered to employees.“They said they are discontinuing since we are not offering any service,” principal Chandrika Ramakrishnan said. Preschools are feeling the pinch also because the time of the lockdown has impacted admissions. “We admit 40 to 50 students every March, This year we barely had three or four admissions and even parents who had taken the form and were to come for the admission could not turn up,” Ramakrishnan said. “We didn’t have admission in April and we don’t see it happening till November. The six months are crucial for us. These are children who will be ready for high school by the time things improve. It is a loss of one lot of children for us,” said Priti Doshi, the founder director of Primary Colours Playhouse and Montessori.",2020-03-05 22:49:00
105,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown: Salt Lake seniors chip in - Telegraph India,"Salt Lake: A group of senior citizens has been pooling money and collecting donations from various blocks in Salt Lake to distribute food packets to migrant workers and the needy.The group includes mostly retired professionals, including doctors and teachers. On Sunday, they handed over masks, soaps and packets of rice, atta and potatoes to labourers, van-pullers and cooks of fast-food stalls that are now closed.The recipients are mostly from other states.The group had raised funds over the past few weeks and started the distribution drive from the community centre in FE Block in the afternoon.Apart from collecting donations, the group has engaged several people who live abroad, Basab Basak, a group member, said.One of the group members had pointed out most labourers and van-pullers who could not return to their hometowns, Basak said. “We decided to help these workers as they now have limited resources and can’t go back…. Now they are without jobs and money.” More than 60 men and women received packets, each of which had 2kg rice, atta and potatoes, apart from two packets of soya beans and a bar of soap.The Bidhannagar commissionerate's airport division gave sanitary napkins to more than 200 women who live in slums in Kaikhali, Teghoria and close to the airport.",2020-03-05 22:50:00
106,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya,A serving of uninhibited fun - Telegraph India,"Posterity will know how much was cooked in Bengali kitchens during lockdown, as every momo, biryani or phuchka that has been made has been posted on the social media. It’s a great thing to watch. Except for a few.They complain that seeing so much food, especially during these times, makes them sick. As do the accompanying images of domestic bliss that seem to flow naturally from the cooking.Besides, they say, one’s posts on one’s cooking and eating, like one’s posts on one’s travels, pets, or babies, are only scintillating to one, not to another. This applies to kitchen divas too.This must be pure envy, but for these disgruntled, there is Nighty Boudi. As the name suggests, she is naughty, and though married, practically single. After lockdown, she has taken to cooking and the results are tantalising. Combining two great Bengali institutions — nightie, or the nightwear that is often worn as a dress, and boudi, literally brother’s wife, but also the seductive married woman next door — she is rampant on Facebook and YouTube.As she gives her cascading brown curls — this can change into sleek black waves in the next video — a vigorous shake and pouts at the camera with her full red lips, it is quite clear that she is focusing as much on the momos she is making as on her host of invisible deors — brothers-in-law, but also a euphemism for willing men.Whatever she does, she does “sexily”. For the momos and the phuchkas, she mixes the dough “sexily” and pleads with her audience to do the same in a typical affected Bengali accent. “Bhalo kore makhun,” she implores. As she speaks, her generous body heaves continuously and she keeps emitting little moans and groans. She is visibly in the throes of a passion.Her husband, she informs briefly, is away.Crude and in-your-face yes, but uninhibited and fun, Nighty Boudi is a refreshing break from the average cooking video. She has takers other than deors in the lakhs of her followers on social media.She is true “camp”. As Susan Sontag says in her 1964 essay ‘Notes on Camp’, the earliest attempt to define the idea: “Camp is a vision of the world in terms of style - but a particular style. It is the love of the exaggerated.” This exaggeration is often a parody: it laughs at the original and puts it in its place.And often, camp is not a straight view of the world.Of course, Nighty Boudi is too good to be true. She drops hints: “I am making a momo, because I am a...,” she says, leaving a word unsaid at first, then she says she is “nothing” (kichhu na), then finally claims she is a “good boy” (bhalo chhele).Boudi is actually Sandy Saha, 24, a well-known Bengali vlogger who is a resident of New Barrackpore on the outskirts of Calcutta. A graduate from Surendranath College, he began to vlog in 2019, often dressing up as a woman in his OTT style. Nighty Boudi, who has also made Dalgona coffee for her viewers, was invented after the lockdown.Sandy, born Sandip, is gay and quite open about his sexuality. But that has no obvious connection with Nighty Boudi, he feels.Neither did he set her up to perform any social correction. “I just wanted a persona that would make people laugh,” he says.His audience is mainly young and they love what he says. His clear references to the female body, language that is at times explicit and his mannerisms — are all lapped up. His family does not mind the content of the videos either; they respect it as his profession. Have we grown less hypocritical as a society?“I have not faced too many adverse comments anywhere,” he says. “Things have changed quite a lot in the last few years regarding acceptance levels”. Also, social media is making visible places that were not seen so much in mainstream media before, such as Sandy’s New Barrackpore locality, where he was born and grew up. The setting gives a video like Sandy’s a clear, new context.He had always wanted to be in the entertainment business. He had taken part in the television show MTV Roadies in 2018.Sandy also runs a beauty parlour in New Barrackpore. “I have always felt drawn towards entertainment, comedy and beauty.” He does his own make-up as Nighty Boudi and the other women, choosing the wigs, which are really too much. In one video, a woman, a precursor to Nighty Boudi, prays fervently to myriad gods to end the lockdown and get the Bengali TV serials back.Sandy, who works with a small team, but is doing everything himself now, would like to work on social media content for the next five to six years. “I would like to also start my own fashion website and brand,” he says.Sometimes he tones himself down. For example, in the momo video, his vocabulary and gestures are less flamboyant than in the previous ones. “Because some had complained I was being vulgar.”Of course Nighty Boudi is vulgar, but she is playfully, hilariously so. “The ultimate camp statement: it’s good because it’s awful!” says Sontag. Nighty Boudi’s “vulgarity” is a good cure for conformity and blandness.In any case, laughter is an excellent antidote to fear, even that of death.",2020-03-05 22:50:00
107,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Tikiapara outreach by cops with ‘Warriors’ - Telegraph India,"Police have set up a team of “Covid warriors” in Tikiapara, Howrah, where cops were attacked last week when they had tried to enforce the lockdown, to tell residents the importance of staying indoors.The “Covid warriors” will reach out to people of the area and explain to them the threat posed by the novel coronavirus and what it means to be Covid positive, the police said.The group will also help residents get medicines and essential items.The group has more than 100 youths, who have been chosen from local clubs, communities and mohallas. They volunteered to reach out to residents of this densely populated part of Howrah, the police said.As a first step, police officers on Saturday visited the house of one of the 13 arrested for the attack on cops and handed over to his family a bag containing rice, pulses, a packet of salt and potatoes.“His mother is a widow and the family is in distress. His uncle is the sole breadwinner and he has a family of his own to look after as well,” an officer said. “The law has taken its own course. But that doesn’t stop us from reaching out to the family of the accused in such times.”“We felt it would be better if local people told residents why the clampdown is necessary,” an officer of the Howrah commissionerate said.“The Covid warriors will be able to clear several misgivings regarding the lockdown… it will help people understand why the police have been asking everyone to stay indoors and avoid any sort of gathering,” the officer said.The work of these volunteers will be monitored and cops will move in as and when required, the officer said. The thrust of the whole exercise will be to clear doubts regarding the coronavirus while helping residents with anything they may require, he said.On April 28, close to 200 men had pelted cops with stones and damaged at least two police vehicles when they had tried to enforce the lockdown.Thirteen men have so far been arrested in connection with the attack on the police.The volunteers have been tagged with vegetable-sellers and local grocers so that they can help out residents if needed, the police said. If there is any problem, cops will reach immediately.Tikiapara, which is near to the Howrah Maidan, is dotted with multi-storey buildings and slums. The place has a population of close to 200,000.",2020-03-05 22:52:00

Baidya, a father of two, took the child home, fed him, gave him clothes and managed to get him connected to his family in Bangladesh through friends and a child welfare organisation there. “He was crying because he thought he had seen his mother. The woman realised the child was mistaking her for his mother and left him at a sweet shop. I brought him home,” said Baidya, who runs a grocery shop. “He started calling me Abba and my wife Ammu. Both my children are younger than him. He is like my eldest son.” The boy is now at a home in South 24-Parganas where he will stay till the lockdown is over. Police have contacted the Bangladesh high commission to arrange for his return home after the lockdown.Baruipur SP Rashid Munir Khan said the boy is in the custody of the child welfare committee and will be sent to Bangladesh after the lockdown.“He (Baidya) had dialled 1098 and got in touch with us. We immediately went to his home to check on the child and alerted the child welfare committee,” said Sheikh Saddam, a member of Childline, a government helpline for issues related to children.With information about the boy’s home and address, Baidya got in touch with friends in Jessore and Kushtia, who managed to locate the child’s home in the Akbarsaha police station area of Chittagong district.The boy got to see his family after eight months in a video call made from Bhangar police station.The child told Baidya that he had fled home after his parents scolded him. “He is the second of three siblings at home and the only son in the family. His father is a truck driver who often travels till the Bengal border,” Baidya said. “I am happy he will be able to reunite with his family. But we are finding it very painful to let him go now.”",2020-03-05 22:53:00
109,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Central health team to tour city - Telegraph India,"Another central team will arrive in Calcutta soon as the Union health ministry is sending 20 public health teams to as many districts across the country reporting the highest number of Covid-19 cases, a release by the Centre’s Press Information Bureau (PIB) said late on Sunday. The new team will only be a “public health team”, according to the release that did not reveal the strength or composition of the public health team. The team will “support the States in implementation of containment measures within these districts, cities”. Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had said on Thursday that there were 264 containment zones in Calcutta out of 444 such zones in all states. Containment zones are localities or neighbourhoods from where Covid-19 cases have been reported. Neighbourhoods from where cases were reported long ago and no new case has been reported in 21 days are not considered containment zones, a corporation official of said.State government officials said about 500 cases have been reported from Calcutta so far.The earlier central team that split into two groups and went to north and south Bengal had alleged lacunae in the state’s Covid testing and reporting mechanism.The inter-ministerial teams headed by additional secretary rank officers of the Centre and members National Disaster Management Authority, department of consumer affairs and a public health specialist. It was not immediately clear whether the team, whose formation was announced on Sunday, will have only public health specialists. The 20 districts the team will visit account for 68 per cent of coronavirus disease patients in hospitals and 70 per cent of Covid-19 deaths.Public health officials have determined that in eight of these districts — Ahmadabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Central Delhi, Calcutta, North Delhi, Kanpur Nagar, Krishna — the doubling time for the total number of infections is faster than 10 days.The ministry said the high doubling rates could be because of poor physical distancing measures, ineffective contact tracing, or large proportions of Covid-19 positive cases among healthcare workers.Field units in such districts would need to verify physical distancing and perimeter control in the containment zones, ensure rigorous contact tracing and determine that healthcare workers have access to protective gear and hydroxychloroquine, the ministry said.",2020-03-05 22:53:00

Her mother and daughter have survived.Police said the family was in distress because a man the victim had trusted defrauded her with false assurances of marriage and forced them to sell their flat, one of their few assets, for the money. Once he got the money, he allegedly refused to marry her — driving the woman to the drastic step.The 38-year-old man, from Haridevpur, was arrested on Wednesday evening. He will be produced in court on Thursday.An officer said a probe revealed that the 33-year-old woman had met this man four years ago through a matrimony site.“The man had been promising marriage since then. According to the allegations, he had taken gold and money from the family on multiple occasions and was forcing the family to sell their flat through distress sale, so that he could take that money, too,” the officer said.Officers said the family did not have any source of income and had allowed their ancestral property to be developed into an apartment block, in which they had taken a flat.The woman who survived has lodged a police complaint on Wednesday blaming the man for allegedly cheating her daughter with the false promise of marriage and forcing the family to sell their flat at a low price for his financial benefits, police sources said.Based on the complaint, officers of Bansdroni police station have arrested the man and started a case of cheating and abetment to suicide and common intention against him.“According to the complainant, soon after they transferred the property title to the new owner, her daughter realised the man was going to take all the money but not keep his promise to marry her.

112,Pinak Ghosh,"Coronavirus lockdown: Hurdles just when banks, post offices draw crowds - Telegraph India","Banks and post offices in the city are facing the twin hurdles of unavailability of staff and patchy network amid a rush on the first three days of June as lockdown norms are being eased.Senior citizens queuing up for pension and owners of small eateries, shops and businesses looking to withdraw cash from their current accounts were among those who stood outside branches for hours.“This is the second time I am coming to the post office to collect my monthly pension. There is either lok nei (no staff) or link nei (no internet connectivity),” said an 80-year-old railway pensioner who eventually collected her pension after waiting for over an hour at the Beleghata post office on Wednesday.“The state government has said restaurants and eateries would be allowed to operate from June 8. So, today I went to the bank branch where I have an account to withdraw cash to buy supplies and pay wages to my staff. But there was a link failure and the manager asked me to visit the branch again in the second half,” said the owner of an eatery at Phoolbagan.Banks and post offices in Calcutta are facing a staff crunch. A large number of employees, especially those who live far away from the city, cannot come to work because of inadequate public transportation, especially the absence of private buses and suburban trains.“Attendance is better in north and south Calcutta. But in the central and eastern parts, there is a concern. This is primarily because many employees come from distant places.... In the districts, the situation is much better because people living closer to the branches, who would otherwise commute to the city, are now available for deployment locally,” said a postal service officer.Bank officials said branches were mostly operating at 50 per cent staff strength on a rotational basis.“As it is, we have to maintain social distancing guidelines. On top of that, there is an unstable network which is adding to the delay in customer service,” said a public sector bank official.Outsourced servicesATM operations have mostly recovered but some outsourced operations such as delivery of cheque books, credit and debit cards through postal and courier services are still far from normal.A customer of a private bank has received a message from his branch urging him to opt for digital services as the bank is unable to provide cheque books on request.“We are hopeful of addressing these issues as the situation normalises,” a private bank official said.“The outsourcing of these services started with the private banks and now government banks have followed.

The government has made it clear that no one will be allowed to stand on private buses and minibuses from Thursday and passengers will have to wear masks.Drivers, conductors and assistants will have to wear gloves apart from masks, and passengers have to be provided with sanitisers.It will take some days for bus services to resume on all routes, according to private bus operators. Many buses are not fit to run because of lack of maintenance during the lockdown, they have said.On May 29, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that buses, both private and state-owned, would ply from June 1. No passenger will be allowed to stand, she had said.People, though, had a hard time as private buses stayed off the roads. Transport minister Suvendu Adhikari met private bus and minibus operators on Tuesday to find a way out of the impasse.At the meeting, Adhikari is learnt to have said that the proposal of setting up a regulatory commission was justified and that government would do so. In return, private bus and minibus operators should not stick to their demand for a fare hike but resume services in the city at the earliest, he said.“We have listened to what the transport minister said… we will resume operations from Thursday,” Pradip Narayan Bose of the West Bengal Bus Minibus Owners’ Association said. “The government has accepted our proposal. We’ve been told that representatives from bus and minibus unions will be members of the commission.”No formal order was issued till late on Wednesday regarding the setting up of a regulatory commission. The exact scope of the commission’s work, along with its responsibilities, is being worked out and a government notification will be issued with the chief minister’s clearance, a transport department official said.“Three senior officials from the department are likely to be in the commission, along with representatives of private bus and minibus operators,” the official said.The commission will take into account wholesale price index, consumer price index, fuel price and cost of investment as the four broad parameters while deciding the fares. Besides, it will take into account the total number of private buses and minibuses in the state, the passenger count during rush hour and the operating costs as well, the official said.“Even before the commission starts functioning, we have asked the government to supply us with masks and gloves for our drivers, conductors and helpers,” Swapan Ghosh of the Minibus Operators Coordination Committee said. “The government has agreed to do so.” 4-passenger nodTaxis, app cabs and autos can now run with four passengers. The move is aimed to gradually normalise the city’s mass transport, a transport official said.“This would give a new lease of life to taxi owners. Drivers have been losing out on passengers because a family of four could not be accommodated,” Sambhu Nath Dey of Progressive Taximen’s Union said. “Unlike autos, taxi fares have not been revised.”An auto operator on the Rashbehari-Gariahat route said fares would be rolled back.",2020-03-06 23:20:00

Therefore, it is imperative for us to consult experts and put in place adequate infrastructure and equipment to ensure the safety of visitors before reopening our centres, including Belur Math,” Swami Suvirananda said.Primarily, it has been decided that the visiting time in the morning would be reduced to two hours and gradually relaxed. The number of people deployed at the main gate will be increased to carry out necessary checks. Only a few of the temples will remain open for darshan initially. Pilgrims are likely to be taken on a tour to these shrines and after the visit is over, they will be handed dry prasadam.Devotees will not be allowed darshan of Swami Smaranananda, the president of the order, in the initial months.

Around 75 per cent students could not attend in Bengal itself,” the chief minister said, quoting Tuesday’s numbers.Metro had reported on Wednesday that around 70 per cent students had not taken the tests in Calcutta’s two centres in TCS Gitobitan in Salt Lake and the Institute of Instrumentation & Metrology in Belghoria on Day 1. There are 15 centres in Bengal, three of which are in Howrah.The chief minister said students were in “great trouble”.“So many students are being totally deprived. They are not able to attend the JEE exam also. That is why we requested the central government so many times to review the matter again so that students are not deprived,” Mamata said.The chief minister said the state had made arrangements in line with the guidelines but yet 75 per cent students could not appear and were “deprived”.“Why is there so much obstinacy, why is there so much pride, why be a egoist? Who gave them the right to destroy the future of students?” Mamata asked. “The students did not say they will not take the examination. They only asked the exam to be deferred. In the midst of Covid-19 when there is a question about health... to pursue a career, what if life is put at risk? The students only wanted the exam to be deferred and needed some time,” she said.“So, what we had said — was it wrong? We do not conduct the exams, the central government does.… I am feeling sad for the students. I will again ask the central government to review how many students could appear for the exam in different states. They should think about students who could not attend,” Mamata said.At TCS Gitobitan, the JEE (Main) centre at Salt Lake, on Wednesday, 3,376 students had been registered to appear for the exam in the two shifts -- 1688 in each. In the first half, 709 students were absent and 858 in the second half, said officials associated with the exams. In Belghoria, out of the 119 students in two shifts,  74 were present.

I had to start doing odd jobs because of the financial need of my family. If my son gets admission to an engineering college it will be difficult for me to fund his education but I will still try because it might open up various opportunities,” Mondal said. “Not appearing for the exam would have meant going out of the competition and an end of hope.”Earnings have dropped considerably and life has became “more difficult” because of the pandemic, he said. “I try to give my best and I hope to get admission to an engineering college,” Diganta who scored 80 per cent in the Higher Secondary exams said.The day for Diganta did not end with the exam at 6pm.

But yes, all seats were occupied and we had masks to keep ourselves safe,” he said. Subhankar and his father started from Balurghat at 8pm on Aug-ust 31 and reached Dunlop on the city’s northern outskirt the next morning.The two are staying at a relative’s place in Dunlop, an option that helped them travel over 400km “in pursuit of a better life”.They will stay at Dunlop for a few more days because Subhankar will take the National Defence Academy exam, scheduled for Sunday.“I could opt for both the exams… and it helped because we had a relative with whom we could stay in Calcutta,” he said.",2020-03-09 03:42:00

The flights will operate twice a week till October 24, the airline said.“The flights are under the Vande Bharat scheme and will operate on Thursdays and Sundays from Calcutta and Wednesdays and Saturdays from London,” an Air India spokesperson said.He said bookings had already started for the flights.According to the airline, the flight will leave Calcutta at 5am on Thursdays and Sundays and reach Heathrow at 11am (London time). While returning, it will leave Heathrow at noon (London time) on Wednesdays and Saturdays and reach Calcutta at 2.20am.The Bengal government has stopped evacuation flights from international destinations unless it issues a no objection certificate for a particular flight. The decision was taken after several evacuees, many of them medical students, had refused to go for paid quarantine after landing in Calcutta.  The government is now allowing chartered flights from other countries to bring evacuees after the ministry of civil aviation revised the SOP and said passengers with negative reports of Covid-19 tests would be allowed to board a flight.“But the rule that an NOC is required for airlines operating evacuation flights is still in place. We have not received any communication from the state government on this,” a Calcutta airport official said.The Air India spokesperson said the civil aviation ministry had asked them to operate the direct flights between Calcutta and London. “We are following all the SOPs issued by the government.”Although not a regular commercial flight, but the direct link to London came after several years.Air India had started a direct flight between Calcutta and London in 2006 but had stopped it after a couple of years. The reason was poor load factor.“We have started getting bookings for the flight. There are many people from the UK who are stuck here, among them are students. Also, there are people from London who want to return home,” Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India, said. “People who want to go to other parts of Europe can take the flight.”There are many people who could not book seats in evacuation flights from London to Delhi or Mumbai because the flights to Calcutta from these six cities were stalled by the state government because of the high number of Covid patients in these cities, according to tour operators.",2020-03-09 03:52:00
119,Sanjay Mandal,Fleecing allegations dog home collection of Covid samples - Telegraph India,"A family in Kasba, who underwent Covid tests last week, alleged the private hospital, which had sent its personnel to collect swab samples from their homes, charged each of the four persons Rs 2,800.When they got the receipt from the hospital, the amount mentioned was Rs 2,250, as stipulated by the state government.Another family in Behala, who had taken the service of the same private hospital to get their swab samples collected from home last week, alleged the person who came to collect the samples asked them to pay Rs 3,200 for each sample.The family in Kasba got in touch with the hospital and officials told them the collection had been outsourced to an agency and it was their people who had collected the samples.“The hospital then sent the agency representative to our home who returned the balance amount but kept Rs 150 as transport cost,” the Kasba resident, a retired central government employee, said.“Initially when we had called the hospital, the person who received the call said they would send someone to our home. At no point were we told that someone from an outsourced agency would collect the samples. So, we thought the hospital was overcharging us.”If a hospital is outsourcing the home collection of swab samples then it has to ensure such agencies maintain hygiene and use proper equipment to collect samples, according to public health experts.The state government has capped the price of Covid-19 tests to a maximum of Rs 2,250. But for collection of samples from home, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has issued an advisory that a maximum of Rs 15 can be charged for every kilometre as transport cost over and above the fixed amount of Rs 2,250.An official of the private hospital off the Bypass said it had 35 such outsourced agencies, which collect samples from homes across Calcutta and North and South 24-Parganas. The hospital collects about 200 samples from homes every day, the official said.“We have trained them on how to collect samples. But it’s not possible to keep a watch on every agency at the micro level. If we get complaints, we immediately address them,” the official said.The chairman of the hospital group said it was not possible to conduct tests at homes for Rs 2,250. “We have told the commission that Rs 15 for every kilometre as transport cost is not viable. They should allow at least an additional Rs 300 for the PPE cost,” he said.The chairman said the outsourced agencies might be overcharging people because of the low margin.Officials of several private hospitals and diagnostic centres said they had not outsourced the swab collection from homes because of such issues. But they agreed that home collection was in high demand because many people were scared to visit hospitals for tests.“Collecting a swab sample for Covid test is a highly specialised job and the technique and equipment should be as per the standards set by the Indian Council of Medical Research,” Somnath Chatterjee, director of Suraksha Diagnostics Pvt Ltd, said.The centre has been doing home collection of swab samples. “We have not outsourced to any agency because of quality control and other issues. The virus transport media, the equipment that is used to collect the sample, should be approved by the ICMR. We are not sure if the outsourced agency would be following the rules. Also, we cannot control the amount they charge people.”The diagnostic centre has been collecting close to 40 samples every day through its own employees, Chatterjee said.The CEO of a private hospital said the hospital had started home swab collections but had brought down the numbers because too many samples could compromise the quality.“We send doctors to collect samples. I am not sure whether the quality can be maintained if any technician who has not undergone proper training is sent,” he said. The samples collected need to be stored in temperature-controlled boxes before being brought to hospital, he said. “It is difficult to ensure an outsourced agency maintains such standards.”",2020-03-09 03:59:00
120,Our Special Correspondent,Thirteen-year-old set for online class found hanging - Telegraph India,"A 13-year-old student of Class VIII was found hanging from the ceiling of his room at their Bansdroni home on Tuesday morning, police said.Jason Ronal’s father, a railway contractor, and mother, who is attached with a dental store in south Calcutta, were at their workplaces and Jason was alone at home. He was supposed to have his online classes, the police said.Jason’s father Julies Oberne, a resident of Kalitala Park in South Bansdroni in the Regent Park police station area, and mother Jyoti told cops that they had left early in the morning leaving Jason at home like other days.Oberne returned around 10.30am to find the door locked from inside. Repeated knocks went unanswered, he told the police.After breaking open the door, Oberne found his son hanging from a bamboo pole in his room, the police said.Jason was declared dead at Baghajatin State General Hospital.Officers of Regent Park police station said they got to know of it only when the hospital reported the matter to Netaji Nagar police station later in the day. “According to the statement of the parents of the student, he had his online classes in the morning,” an officer of Regent Park police station said.The police have started a case of unnatural death. The body has been sent for post-mortem.The officer said cops would check Jason’s phone for any possible clue.Jason was a student of St Clare School on Bandipur Road in the Regent Park area.“We will talk to his teachers and friends to find out if they had noticed anything unusual in his behaviour in the past few days,” an officer in Lalbazar said.Several parents Metro spoke to have expressed concern over their children getting restless because of the prolonged confinement at home during the pandemic.“My son has become irritable. We cannot allow him to go out and play football with his friends even though our home is right in front of a huge ground. For young boys it is difficult to stay indoors for such a long time,” Pallabi Mukherjee, a resident of Garia, said.",2020-03-09 04:21:00
121,Subhankar Chowdhury,IIT Kharagpur snaps Net in hostels to ‘evict’ boarders - Telegraph India,"The IIT Kharagpur authorities have disconnected the Internet in hostels, fuelling charges that it was intended at forcing students to vacate the rooms. The director had asked all students to leave the campus by August 30. The Net connection in all five hostels was snapped on Tuesday evening, an official said.The decision was taken three days after 65 research scholars had written to director V.K. Tewary that they were unable to leave the campus by Sunday and had sought permission to stay in the hostels till the situation became normal.Apart from the research scholars, a few BTech and MTech students are on the campus as they cannot return home in the absence of trains and some of their family members have comorbidities.A boarder of the Nivedita hall of residence said the Wi-Fi and LAN services had been stopped and that they were unable to attend online classes or access journals on their laptops in the hostels.The online classes for the autumn semester have started from September 1 and live classes are being held on Microsoft Teams.“As the Internet facilities have been withdrawn, we could not attend the live classes. Some of the students have to buy expensive data packs to attend classes on their smartphones. But one cannot keep buying high-speed packs for the entire semester,” a boarder said.A research scholar said for the purpose of reference one had to consult various international journals. “As long as we had Net connectivity in the hostels, we could access the journals free of cost. Now, we have to subscribe against a steep payment to access the journals on smartphones,” she said.Any institute of higher learning, through its research grant, subscribes to journals and students can access 
them from hostels with Net connectivity, a teacher said.Another research scholar said they had to step outside the hostels and stand or sit in the open to access the institute’s network facility.“But we are allowed to step out only for an hour for lunch. Besides, one cannot concentrate on studies or research in the open,” he said.The dean of students’ affairs, Somesh Kumar, said: “The Internet facilities have been withdrawn following the decision of higher authorities.”A BTech student said the institute which had sent its officials, along with security men, to evict the boarders from one of the halls on August 24, has now adopted a different ploy so that students leave the hostels on their own.A video had emerged that purportedly showed an official of IIT Kharagpur, accompanied by guards, telling students at Madan Mohan Malviya hall of residence to vacate the campus, failing which their belongings would be taken away.“Now they are withdrawing the Net service to throw us out,” a student said.The IIT authorities had on August 19 asked the 300-odd students still on the campus to move out by August 23 after a student had tested positive for Covid-19.Now the number has risen to 12, five of them being students.“The institute is asking the students to leave the campus for their own safety. The director has requested them repeatedly. The bulk of the students have left, only a handful refuse to understand,” an official said.",2020-03-09 04:27:00
122,Our Special Correspondent,"Sky set to clear, heat & humidity to rise: Met - Telegraph India","A cyclonic circulation triggered moderate rainfall in the city on Tuesday and Wednesday.It brought temporary relief from the rising heat and humidity in the city since last weekend. But sweaty conditions are likely to gradually be back in the city, said a Met official.“A cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal led to the rainfall. The system now lies over Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Jharkhand and extends up to 0.9km above mean seal level,” said a Met update on Wednesday evening.“The monsoon trough now passes through Bahraich, Gaya, Shantiniketan and eastwards to Manipur across Bangladesh and south Assam,” the update said. “Another cyclonic circulation is brewing over the Bay of Bengal off the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu coasts. It is too far from Bengal to have an impact here,” said the Met official.From Friday to Monday, the maximum temperature hovered around 35 degrees. The high moisture content in the air, typical of August, had made it more sweltering. The maximum temperature on Monday was 35.4 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal. Around 2.30pm, the RealFeel — calculated by weather portal AccuWeather.com — was 43 degrees.The hot and sultry spell was broken by sharp thundershowers that started from early Tuesday. From Tuesday morning to Wednesday night, the city got multiple spells of rain.The sky was overcast for most of the two days. Roads were deserted on Monday because of the lockdown in the state. But on Tuesday and Wednesday, traffic was slow at several busy intersections because of the rain.The first few days of a month see a sizeable queue outside government banks — mostly senior citizens waiting to draw their persons. Around 11am on Wednesday, over 20 elderly people were jostling for space under a sunshade outside a nationalised bank in Behala. They were trying to take shelter from the train. Only a few were being allowed inside the bank at a time to maintain social distancing.The Met office recorded around 40mm of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The volume was not much but the overcast and windy conditions led to a dip in the temperature. Tuesday’s maximum temperature was 27.1 degrees, five notches below normal. On Wednesday, it had climbed to around 30 degrees, still two notches below normal.“The sky is expected to clear from Thursday afternoon. There could be occasional showers but it is likely to get hotter from Thursday,” the Met official said. “There is usually a lot of moisture in the air during the monsoon. At times like this, when the rain dries up and there are no clouds, allowing the sun to beat down hard, the temperature rises and the moisture in the air makes the weather sweaty and uncomfortable,” the official said.",2020-03-09 04:40:00
123,Debraj Mitra,Covid stalls Bengal wild animal study - Telegraph India,"The pandemic has put the brakes on a study to assess the habitat and distribution of hyenas, wolves and some other wild animals said to be found in the forests of the western districts of Bengal.These animals do not hog the limelight and are not the centre of conservation efforts like their illustrious peers — tiger and elephant. Outside reserve forests areas, their population is undocumented and the extent of their distribution largely anecdotal, said forest officials. The study is the first step to plug that gap.The study, commissioned two years ago and being done by the Zoological Survey of India, is under the West Bengal Forest and Biodiversity Conservation Project, funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). It covers hyenas, wolves, golden jackals, leopard cats and wild boars.A team of ZSI researchers had spent months in the forests of Purulia, Jhargram, West Midnapore and Bankura. Phase one of the study involved direct sightings, taking pictures, studying scat samples, pugmarks and kills of carnivores.Based on the direct and indirect evidence, the researchers have zeroed in on multiple “frequent encounter sites”. The second stage involves laying trap cameras at these places.Around 30 cameras were placed at a patch of forest surrounding the Ayodhya hills in Purulia. But they had to be taken off because of risk of damages by human interference.“A park or a sanctuary is a protected forest area with minimal human interference. But these are open forests, frequently accessed by people living in the villages on the fringes,” said Lalit Kumar Sharma, scientist and officer in charge of the wildlife division of the ZSI, who is coordinating the project.The researchers had requested the forest department to ensure security of the equipment. Following an assurance, a fresh lot of cameras was supposed to have been placed from this March. The images captured from the camera traps would be used to analyse the population density of a species.But the Covid-19 curbs have delayed the process by at least a few months, said a ZSI official.“Our team has had hyena sightings at a forest near the Ayodhya hills in Purulia. We have not seen wolves but indirect evidence — scat and other samples used for DNA analysis — suggest there are multiple wolves in these forests,” said Sharma.The forests of Purulia, Jhargram, West Midnapore and Bankura are interspersed with human settlements.A senior wildlife official, instrumental in starting the project, explained its significance.“The smaller animals in a tiger habitat, like the Sunderbans, are studied in detail as part of the tiger census. They form the prey base and are treated like important subjects. But the forests of south Bengal (other than the Sunderbans) are not tiger habitats. Neither are they protected forests. The smaller animals in these areas have so far remained outside the ambit of documentation,” the official told Metro.The ZSI study also aims to provide insights into the human-wildlife conflict involving these animals and suggest ways of mitigation.Human-wildlife conflict in these parts mostly involve marauding herds of elephants. But it is not limited to pachyderms only.A hyena was allegedly killed, beheaded and chopped into pieces by some residents of a village in Purulia in the third week of July. Forest officials suspected it to have been a retaliatory killing because the hyena had strayed into the village and lifted some livestock.In February 2019, a wolf was captured by residents of a Jhargram village after the animal allegedly attacked a number of locals.The researchers have surveyed villagers living on the fringes of the forests. They interviewed individual villagers and interacted with communities to assess the “damages” caused by wild animals. The villagers were asked about “encounters” with wild animals.“We have identified a few conflict hotspots and have shared the details with the forest department,” said Sharma of ZSI.",2020-03-09 04:51:00
124,Our Special Correspondent,Plan to end ‘chaos’ at Kolkata airport as flights resume - Telegraph India,"Airlines and airport authorities will deploy more people to handle the chaos at Calcutta airport on the days when flights to six cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, will operate, officials said on Wednesday.Airport and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials and representatives of airlines conducted a survey of the terminal building to find out how the chaos can be prevented.On Tuesday, many passengers missed their flights and several flights were delayed because of long queues on the first day of resumption of flights between Calcutta and Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur.“Most of the passengers are first-time fliers and many do not have smartphones to comply with the travel requirements as part of the new Covid-19 guidelines. This is the most significant challenge faced by the airport and airlines and it is slowing down the process of check-in. Airline personnel are helping these people but we will allocate more people to make the process faster from Thursday,” Captain Sarvesh Gupta, advisor to the airline operators’ committee at Calcutta airport, said.Airline officials said they would deploy employees outside the terminal building where passengers have been standing in long queues to enter the building.“They will ask passengers if they have the Arogya Setu app and have done the web check-in, which are mandatory. If some passengers don’t have that, they will be taken out of the queue and helped by airline employees to fill up self-declaration forms stating they do not have symptoms of Covid-19 and get the web check-in done,” an official of an airline said.Metro had on Wednesday reported how passengers were stuck at the entrance to the terminal and in the security hold area and that airlines had alleged lack of preparedness on part of the airport authorities.One of the issues was first-time fliers not having the required documents on their smartphones while some did not have smartphones.“We have to assist these passengers,” Gupta said.Airport officials said they would deploy more CISF personnel at various points.“Additional CISF personnel would be deployed at the gates so that those who have all the necessary documents can be cleared by them,” airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya said.He said the automatic tray retrieval system at the security check counters where passengers put their belongings for X-ray scanning have been made fully operational on Wednesday.“This should reduce the congestion in the security hold area to some extent,” Bhattacharya said.Airport officials said another plan was to deploy airline and CISF personnel to ensure all security check counters were utilised to the optimum.“Many first-time fliers are standing in one long queue while the other counters for security check are not that congested. These personnel would redirect the passengers to counters that are less congested,” an airport official said.",2020-03-09 05:00:00
125,Subhajoy Roy,CMC for fire law changes to facilitate construction - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the fire department will approach the government to amend sections of the fire services act that come in the way of construction of five or six-storey buildings, Firhad Hakim said on Wednesday.Hakim, the chairperson of the CMC’s board of administrators, held a meeting with fire officers and CMC officials where the proposal to amend the act was discussed.The CMC’s building rules allow certain relaxations for new constructions coming up in place of old, crumbling structures. The relaxations are related to leaving mandatory open space on the plot and the building’s height vis-a-vis the road width in the front.“The building rules allow lesser open space in case of buildings in place of old, crumbling structures and if the old buildings have multiple tenants,” a CMC official said. This relaxation is given to ensure the new structure has adequate space to rehabilitate all tenants. “We have to give some incentive to builders.”In allowing the additional space, the height of the building increased. In the building rules, the height of a building depends on the road width in the front. “In case of buildings with tenants, the height is more than what is allowed for other buildings with a road of similar width in the front,” the official said.The relaxations are given to five or six-storey buildings, he said.“We will jointly send a proposal to amend portions of the fire services act. A lot of building plans are not getting approved because of this,” Hakim said.",2020-03-09 05:16:00

The teachers of the respective colleges will be engaged for evaluating the answers of the students.The undergraduate examinations will start on October 1 and continue till October 8, the vice-chancellor told Metro.All the 68 postgraduate departments of the university have been advised to complete the examinations within October 8, she said.The time-table of both the exams will be announced within a few days, the vice-chancellor said.The marks of all the undergraduate and postgraduate examinations will have to be sent to the controller of examination department of the university by every college within October 18.The results of the examinations of all the streams will be declared within October 31.This is the first time the university has adopted the open-book examination for all undergraduate and postgraduate courses. It was not heard of in the 163-year old history of the university.It has been adopted as an alternative measure only for the current year in view of the pandemic, a professor of the university said.There will be no change in the pattern of the undergraduate questions to be provided to the students.But the postgraduate departments will be advised to change the question pattern and incorporate more “analytical” questions since the examination will be on open-book mode, an official said.   The university may consider bringing in some changes in the marking pattern of the undergraduate examinations because students will be given 24 hours for uploading the answers, an official of the university said.“Students can take the help of private tutors or friends for writing the answers.. We need to ensure that the evaluation of the answers is held in a fair manner,” the official said.Postgraduate students will be examined the same way and they too will have to upload the answers within 24 hours.The departments will evaluate the answers and have to send the marks to the controller of examinations department within October 18.More than 1.10 lakh examinees will appear for the undergraduate and post graduate examinations, an official said.   The decisions were taken at a meeting of the university’s faculty council on Wednesday.The time-table and the other instructions for the colleges, teachers and students will be announced after discussing the faculty council decisions at the university’s syndicate body. The meeting of the syndicate will be held soon, the vice-chancellor said.The examinations in each subject will be held on 100 percent marks allotted in the papers.“Our target is to declare the results within October 31. But we can declare the results of a particular course a few days before the targeted date if all the marks reach us before October 18,” she said.    The third-year BA and BSc exams under the 1+1+1 system and the final (sixth) semester examinations in BCom were slated in April but they got deferred because of Covid-19.The final year (fourth) semester postgraduate examinations also got deferred.Education minister Partha Chatterjee had said on Monday that the final year undergraduate and postgraduate examinations will have to be  conducted by the universities within October 1 and 18 and the results will have to be declared within October 31.",2020-03-09 05:30:00
127,Our Bureau And Agencies,JU teachers want autonomy to conduct final semester exams  - Telegraph India,"A teachers' body at Jadavpur University has urged Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to ensure that the institution is given the required autonomy to conduct the final semester examinations.The Jadavpur University Teachers' Association (JUTA), in a recent letter to Banerjee, also said the state government-stipulated date of October 31 for declaring results is not feasible as it falls just after the Durga Puja festivities.JUTA general secretary Partha Pratim Roy said that the university should be given the autonomy to decide the dates of assessment and declaration of results.The JUTA, the largest teachers' body in JU, wants a quick completion of the entire evaluation process but it should be decided by the university itself, he said.The advisory issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to mandatorily conduct final semester examinations by September 30 has put the students under stress, the teachers' body said.The recent follow-up action of the state Higher Education Department, asking the universities to conduct the final semester examinations between October 1 and 18 and declare results by October 31, is further inconveniencing the students, it said.""If the universities, as advised by the state government, fix the assessment in October, they will have to take the permission of the UGC, as per the Supreme Court order on August 28.""Given the present scenario, where the UGC seems to be taking decisions in an arbitrary and unscientific manner, this may give rise to another set of uncertainties regarding the granting of permission to hold examinations in October which will increase the pressure on the students,"" Roy said in the letter.Pointing out that Durga Puja will be celebrated across the state from October 22, the JUTA said, ""If the assessment process commences at the beginning of October and is completed by October 18, as advised by the Higher Education Department, many students will miss the opportunity to join other higher educational institutions or take up jobs.""The JUTA reminded the chief minister that the JU had initially prepared a protocol for assessment based on the Higher Education Department's advisory issued in April, which allowed the universities to prepare their own procedure for assessment.""However, after most of the assessments were completed at JU, the department had issued a fresh advisory on June 27 proposing an 80-20 formula, wherein 20 per cent of the score for a paper would be awarded based on the student's performance during the final semester and 80 per cent would be given on the basis of his/her results in the previous semester examinations,"" it said.As a result, JU was forced to change the whole assessment procedure and ""prepare results of the terminal semester/final year based on the June 27 advisory and the results prepared on the basis of the said advisory have now become redundant"", the teachers' body said.The JUTA said the Higher Education Department's previous advisory to the state universities to conduct examinations in October ""seemed to have been taken in haste without taking into consideration the specific issues and problems faced by different universities"".",2020-03-09 14:34:00
128,Kinsuk Basu, Calcutta Medical College: First coronavirus hospital in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The state government on Tuesday decided to convert the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital into a dedicated hospital to treat patients infected with Covid-19.The decision has been taken as part of the government’s effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus in Bengal, a health department official said. “We still don’t know the number of people who have come in contact with those who have tested positive and may be carrying the virus asymptomatically. These patients might start showing symptoms within weeks.”The College Street hospital has 2,200 beds.

129,Subhankar Chowdhury,Harass over health hazard fear in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Two essential service providers have complained that they are being harassed in their neighbourhoods for doing their job during the coronavirus outbreak.A nurse at the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital alleged her landlady had asked her not to return to the rented accommodation because coronavirus patients are being treated at her hospital and she could be a health hazard to neighbours.A ground employee of IndiGo alleged she was being discriminated against and taunted by neighbours at her housing complex in Thakurpukur. Her mother, who stays with her, was allegedly refused grocery.Ranita Karmakar Sarkar, the nurse, stays in a rented accommodation at Durganagar, near the airport.“I was returning from my in-laws’ home in Kalyani when the landlady called up on my husband’s mobile on Sunday afternoon and asked about me. When I spoke to her, she wanted to know if I would be going to work on Monday. As I said ‘yes’, she told me that we should not stay there because I would pose a health risk to other residents,” Ranita said on Tuesday night.Ranita, who graduated from the College of Medicine and JNM Hospital in Kalyani in 2001, has been working at the Beleghata hospital for four years. She said she could not believe that the community she was serving was distancing her for her service.“I told the landlady that it was as good as the community distancing me because of the service I have been providing to the community,” said Ranita.“Today I am realising how selfish man could get. I am a nursing staff at the Beleghata ID and BG Hospital…. Today the landlord is telling me that I should not return to the rented accommodation. Because I am a nursing staff at the hospital…” Ranita posted on Facebook on Sunday.She warned her landlady through a relative that she would complain to police.“I had this message conveyed to her through one of my relatives, who had arranged the accommodation. That has kept her quiet and I have been able to return home,” Ranita said.The Resident Doctors’ Association and the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum wrote to the Union health ministry and chief minister Mamata Banerjee respectively, on Wednesday, complaining about harassment faced by health workers.Ranita said an elderly nurse colleague was not allowed to board a bus on her way home from the hospital. “The 62-year-old nurse, who stays in New Town, waved at the bus to stop. But it did not. Later, it emerged that this was happening to a lot of employees at our hospital. Buses were refusing to stop near the hospital,” she said.The IndiGo employee tweeted about her plight on Tuesday. “People are spreading rumour in my locality that I am suffering the corona. First. Secondly, when I am not at my home, me and my mother stay together, that’s it and when I am not at home, they are coming and harassing my mother like anything. She cannot go to the market to buy the groceries because people are refusing her saying that your daughter has a corona and you might also have it and you are spreading to other people as well. So me earnest request is….”Calcutta police swung into action after tracking the tweet.“Senior officers have spoken to the lady.

As of now, nine persons in Bengal have tested positive for the coronavirus and there has been one death.“Samples of 190 people in the state have tested positive so far. Fourteen results are awaited,” a health department official said.A 58-year-old man who had returned from Egypt and a 55-year-old woman back from the UK recently tested positive for the virus on Tuesday. Their samples were tested at the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) in Beleghata.“The woman had arrived from the UK four days ago. She was home all through. Only her husband had stepped out once to buy groceries. We have asked her husband and son, who drove her to hospital, to stay in home quarantine. Their samples will be collected tomorrow,” a health department official said.The man who had returned from Egypt, as well as his wife and daughter, have come in contact with many people, officials said.The man and the woman were admitted to the quarantine ward of the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital. After the test reports arrived, they were shifted to the isolation facility for Covid-19 patients in the hospital.An official said the man had been having symptoms of coronavirus infection since March 15 and was admitted to the hospital on March 21.“His samples were first collected on Saturday and the report was negative. When samples were tested again on Tuesday, they turned out to be positive,” the official said. “This shows initial negative reports could be misleading and highlights the need for isolation.”Health department sources said they were speaking to family members of the man. “He was admitted to hospital five days after he showed the symptoms. We are trying to find out the people he came in contact with.

131,TT Bureau,Lockdown day 1: police crack whip in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Most of Calcutta remained indoors on Tuesday, the first full day of lockdown, and the few who stepped out were stopped by police on the road.Altogether, 1,003 people were arrested across the city for alleged violation of lockdown between 5pm on Monday and 5pm on Tuesday.The markets had everything stocked up — from vegetables to fish. At Gariahat, a vegetable seller was heard telling a visitor: “You were scrambling for leftovers yesterday. Why don’t you take the fresh stuff today?”A medicine store in Behala had a queue of at least 20 people in front of it in the morning. But it was not too crowded inside. “I am allowing only four customers inside at a time as a precaution against the coronavirus,” the owner said.Checkposts were set up on every other major thoroughfare. Almost every person on the road was asked to explain why he or she had stepped out in violation of the lockdown.An officer posted at a central Calcutta intersection stopped a biker in the morning. “He said he was trying to utilise his ‘holiday’ and going to meet his elderly uncle,” the officer said. The man was booked under IPC Section 188 (disobedience of government order).A senior officer said some people were yet to understand the urgency of the situation. South Calcutta, where 271 people were arrested, saw the maximum number of violations.A posse of policemen set up a checkpost on the Howrah bridge early in the morning. Every two and four-wheeler headed to the city was stopped. The riders and drivers were being asked to show their “papers” before being allowed to proceed. A youth who said he worked in a government bank was allowed to proceed after he showed his identity card. Another man said he ran a grocery store in the Howrah Maidan area and was headed for the Burrabazar wholesale market. An officer asked him to show his trade licence. He failed and was asked to go back.Similar checkposts — nakas in police parlance — were visible across the city, from Lake Town in the north to Behala in the south. The number of cops often matched the number of motorists and on some stretches there were more cops than motorists.Around 10am, a woman and two men, their faces covered in masks, were standing near the bus terminus at Esplanade with luggage. The woman said they were part of a group headed home to Behrampore. The group was seen pleading with cops to arrange transport for them.A Naktala resident who was headed to a cancer hospital in Rajarhat, where his father-in-law had a chemo session, was stopped at multiple places.But every time he was allowed to proceed because he could show medical papers.Police were seen making announcements at some places asking people to stay indoors.",2020-03-24 20:50:00
132,Sanjay Mandal,Calcutta airport wears ‘haunted’ look - Telegraph India,"“On Tuesday, barely 20,000 passengers arrived,” an airport official said.The domestic section usually sees long queues at security check-in counters and boarding gates almost throughout the day. In the morning and evening rush hours, many passengers don’t get seats in the boarding area. There are often queues in toilets as well.On Wednesday, though, only a few members of the cleaning staff and some officials were there. “The terminal looks like a haunted house,” an official said.The terminal may be empty but Calcutta’s air traffic control is still functioning and handling overseas flights. The ATC usually handles around 1,500 overseas flights, mostly to Southeast Asia, the Far East and Australia, an airport official said.“Now, the number of overseas flights has gone down to a little over 500. We have reduced our staff strength by 50 per cent,” an official said.The city airport was almost deserted on Wednesday except for men in fluorescent jackets disinfecting chairs and railings.All flights have been suspended and officials said the airport would remain closed at least till April 14.The authorities have started disinfecting the entire terminal building. Airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee said the entire 200,000sq m terminal, including the domestic and international arrival and departure areas, would be cleaned and disinfected. It would take two days for the disinfection drive to be completed.Trolleys are often not to be found where they should be at the airport, but not now. “More than 3,000 trolleys are being disinfected with special chemicals. Along with this, the floors, handrails of escalators and walkalators and even airline offices are being disinfected,” Bhattacharjee said. The counters of airlines, immigration, customs and security check-in, too, will be be cleaned and sanitised.The building is being sealed with Central Industrial Security Force personnel guarding the gates. The airport director said once the disinfection drive was complete, basic services would be kept functional, including servers.The health screening counters for international passengers are now empty.Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the terminal handled 70,000 passengers every day on an average, with 500 flights (international and domestic) taking off and landing.",2020-03-25 20:43:00
133,Sanjay Mandal,Physicians across Calcutta get panic calls - Telegraph India,"A woman in her 40s called up a physician on Thursday morning and asked him whether she had Covid-19 because she thought she had difficulty breathing the previous night.The doctor enquired about the overall health of the south Calcutta resident and said she was doing fine.Respiratory distress, along with fever and persistent dry cough, is a symptom of coronavirus infection. In some cases, a person who has contracted the virus could have mild or no symptoms.Doctors across Calcutta are getting calls from panic-stricken people with symptoms ranging  from runny nose to stomach disorder, asking whether they have contracted the virus.“Someone had sneezed twice in a day and called me to ask whether he should undergo a Covid-19 test. Such is the panic among people, and it is quite natural,” physician Rahul Jain said.“Most of the callers are suffering from fever or sore throat, symptoms that are common during this time of the year. I am asking them to wait for a day. If fever or other symptoms persist for more than a day, they should go to a doctor,” Jain said.“It is preferable to visit one of the fever clinics opened by government hospitals but one can also consult one’s personal physician to avoid crowd.”There are “confusion and panic” among people, said Ajoy Krishna Sarkar, pulmonologist and intensive care specialist. “My phone is ringing continuously throughout  the day.... The coronavirus symptoms are mostly similar to those of common flu but it’s uncommon that a patient would have a runny nose.”Oncologists, too, are getting calls.“Many cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy has a low white blood cell count, which often leads to fever. Many patients are calling me to ask whether their fever is related to the coronavirus,” surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay said.“We are asking the day they received the last chemotherapy dose and then trying to find out whether the low WBC count is normal.”Mukhopadhyay said cancer patients were more panicked than others because their compromised immunity made them more vulnerable to infections.According to the World Health Organisation, the novel coronavirus affects people in different ways.“Covid-19 is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment,” it says.",2020-03-26 22:37:00
135,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Councillor shoos away shoppers without masks in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A councillor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation allegedly shooed away shoppers from a market in Salt Lake because they were not wearing masks on Thursday morning.When some shoppers tried to reason with councillor Debasish Jana that only those with cough and cold should wear masks, he allegedly told them that they should be thrashed.The health department advisories say a person should wear a mask only when he or she is suffering from cough and cold or if he or she is in direct contact with a Covid-19 patient.Jana, the Trinamul councillor of Ward 34, is also the mayoral council member in charge of solid waste management in the Bidhannagar civic body.He turned up at the market in Salt Lake’s GD Block to ensure that shoppers were keeping their faces covered and maintaining social distancing.Jana was asked whether his instructions to shoppers went against the health department’s guidelines. “How do we know that the person standing nearby is not carrying the virus? I had asked people to wear masks or keep their nose and mouth covered with a piece of cloth,” he told Metro. “If everyone covers their mouth and nose, everyone is safe.”Jana said he had also ensured that all railings at the market were disinfected so that the elderly, who often lean against railings for support, were safe.Allegations have surfaced that he sent back several people home who were not wearing masks and also uttered harsh words against them.“People like you should be thrashed,” he was heard on a purported video of the incident telling a scooterist without a mask in front of the market.To others, he was heard saying: “No mask, go back home.”The state health department’s guidelines mention that the mask worn by someone with symptoms of coronavirus infection has to be mandatorily changed every six to eight hours to prevent spread of the infection.A senior health department official said if the Covid-19 guidelines were to be followed strictly, a mask should only be worn to prevent spread of droplets from an infected person.“Since Covid-19 is not caused by any air-borne virus, a healthy person does not need to wear a mask. Because even after wearing a mask, a healthy person could be exposed to the virus by means of finger touch. A mask is essential to prevent spread of droplets from an infected person,” said an official.Another health department official said people were advised not to panic or rush to buy masks.“There is a limited stock of masks. Imagine what would happen to the ill, if all masks are bought by healthy people,” he said.",2020-03-26 22:44:00
137,Our Special Correspondent,"Woman gives in after 3 hours, gets off bus to get herself tested for coronavirus in Calcutta - Telegraph India","A 38-year-old woman with persistent cough stayed put on a state bus for over three hours at the Beleghata hospital for infectious diseases on Thursday after the driver reached the hospital to get her tested for the coronavirus.The South Bengal State Transport Corporation bus had brought the woman from Barakar near Asansol to Calcutta on the request of police there. The driver had left Barakar with the woman and the conductor around 5am, an SBSTC official said in Calcutta.The bus had reached Barakar from Howrah early on Thursday with more than 100 labourers who had been stranded at Howrah station the night before.“As the bus was preparing to return, a police team in Barakar requested the driver to ferry the woman to Calcutta. She was the lone passenger and she kept coughing all throughout,” the SBSTC official said.After reaching the SBSTC depot Esplanade, the driver alerted the police about the woman and that she had refused to meet a doctor.An officer from Maidan police station apparently asked the driver to take her to the Beleghata hospital as there was no ambulance at their disposal. Not sure what to do, the driver informed the depot manager in Belghoria and drove the bus to the hospital around 9.45am.At the hospital, employees in protective gear tried to persuade her to get off the bus but she refused. “She kept saying her health was fine and that there was no need for any test,” said a hospital official. “We didn’t know what to do.”The police intervened after the hospital authorities sought their help. She stepped off the bus, which had been sanitised from outside by then, around 1.30pm. She was told that she needed to undergo a preliminary test for a few minutes and if the doctors were satisfied, she would be allowed to go home immediately.“A team of doctors checked on her and concluded she had to undergo further tests,” an officer said.An ambulance meant for suspected coronavirus patients sent by Swasthya Bhavan officials took her to MR Bangur Hospital.The woman has been admitted to an isolation ward in the hospital after doctors realised it was necessary to keep her in isolation, according to late evening reports.“We have alerted her family members in Bosepukur, Kasba,” a doctor at the hospital said. “The results should come by early Friday.”",2020-03-26 22:49:00

Many others have decided to contribute to the teachers’ council funds of their respective colleges from where the amount will be transferred to the chief minister’s relief fund, principals said.Education minister Partha Chatterjee had appealed to all educational institutions to contribute to the chief minister’s relief fund on Wednesday.“All 95 permanent teachers and around 55 non-teaching employees of the college will donate one day’s salary,” said Siuli Sarkar, the principal of Lady Brabourne College.“We got in touch with the teachers over the phone today. The response was overwhelming.”Atashi Karpha, the principal of Gokhale Memorial Girls’ College, said almost all the teachers of her college will contribute for the cause.They will transfer their contribution to the teachers’ council fund of the college, from where it will be transferred to the chief minister’s relief fund.Shamyalendu Chatterjee, the principal of Chittaranjan College who is coordinating between the college heads to raise funds, said the target is to generate at least Rs 2 crore. “Many teachers are willing to donate more than a day’s salary,” he said.Jaipuria College, Jogesh Chowdhury College and other institutions have decided to grant full remuneration to all security staff, who are paid on a daily basis.",2020-03-26 22:54:00
139,TT Bureau,Lockdown violations halve in Calcutta in a day - Telegraph India,"The number of reported lockdown violations in Calcutta reduced to almost half on Thursday compared to Wednesday as police stepped up vigil on markets and shops that were open for essential supplies.Between 5pm on Tuesday and 5pm on Wednesday, 871 people were prosecuted. The number dropped to 453 between 5pm on Wednesday and 5pm on Thursday.“It is a relief that people have understood the implication of the lockdown,” an officer at Lalbazar said. “They have realised no one will be spared if found violating the restrictions without reason.”The police continued their vigil across the city to ensure people maintained social distancing outside shops.On Tuesday and Wednesday, there were reports of people thinking it was safe to roam the empty roads. There were also reports of misbehaviour with cops and deliberate violation of rules.“People were caught lying to roam around. We were left with no option but to prosecute them,” an officer said.On Thursday, the picture on the roads was “a little different”, he said. “There were fewer violations and that is the only hope.”Maximum violations were reported from the northern pockets of Calcutta and the minimum from the city police’s east division. The central and south suburban divisions had an almost equal number of violations, police said.  Apart from ensuring that people followed lockdown restrictions, cops helped people in crisis. A vehicle from Tangra police station helped a pregnant woman reach RG Kar hospital from Christopher Road around Wednesday midnight when the vehicle she was in broke down.A southwest traffic guard officer spotted a child with thalassaemia with his parents looking for a vehicle in the Jinjira Bazar area on Thursday.

141,Kinsuk Basu,Mamata runs checks on Calcutta markets - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited various markets on Thursday amidst concerns that the supply of grocery items and locally produced vegetables had taken a hit in certain parts of the city.Milk and bread are scarce. The supply of fish, which is mostly from other states, is not abundant as well.Mamata started her visit with Posta in Burrabazar before visiting the retail hubs of Taltala in central Calcutta and Gariahat in the south to get a sense of the goings-on. She has said supply of essentials should not be affected.“Transporting vegetables is a challenge for some vendors in the absence of suburban trains,” an agriculture marketing department official said. “There’s hope that things will improve. All necessary instructions have been given to people concerned. Things will be out in another 24 hours.”In Shyambazar in the north, and Jadu Babu Nazar, Lake Market and Gariahat in the south, many stores blamed the supply shortfall for running out of stock.The suppliers, on their part, said they did not have sufficient number of people to do the job. Some accused cops of stopping supply vehicles, especially empty ones which were on their way to fetch goods. Supply chain workers are scared, they said.A government official said the chief minister chose Posta because the availability of workers was important to the loading and unloading of goods and the biggest wholesale market in eastern India remained a vital source of grocery items and onions.“There are several dharamsalas here. Labourers can be accommodated there,” Mamata told a team of police officers, led by commissioner Anuj Sharma. “Issue passes to those who are regulars at these markets. Let it be one pass, which will be valid across the state.”She instructed an officer of the rank of additional police commissioner to act as “nodal officer” for Posta and adjoining areas.Several traders in Burrabazar and Posta said they had not opened their shops because of shortage of labourers. Many had returned home to neighbouring states, they said.A Lake Market trader blamed the police. “We don’t have any proper identity proof to satisfy the cops. Have you seen trucks with supplies outside Lake Market or Gariahat or Entally today (Thursday)?”While speaking to vegetable vendors, the chief minister spoke of the need for social distancing and staying open. At Taltala and other markets, she drew circles outside shops to indicate the distance shoppers should keep among themselves in a queue.At Gariahat, she told a vegetable seller: “While handing over the vegetable basket, see to it that your hands don’t touch that of the customer.",2020-03-26 23:19:00
143,TT Bureau,Fire at CESC station hits areas off Bypass in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A fire at an 11KV distribution centre of CESC on Friday evening caused a power outage in phases across several parts of the city’s southern and eastern fringes.The blackout, that made the ongoing lockdown worse, started around 5.40pm. Till 9pm, several houses in Patuli, Garia and Santoshpur were still without power.The utility said a spark was spotted in an underground cable around 5.30pm. “Thick smoke followed the spark. Firefighters sprang to action and the fire was controlled by 7pm. As a safety protocol, the feed from the entire station was stopped during the operation,” said a senior official of CESC, who was at the spot.The receiving station near Baghajatin railway station, where the fire occurred, supplies power to “parts of Patuli, Santoshpur and Garia”. There are multiple hospitals in the vicinity. “The power supply snapped around 5.30pm and we turned to our generators. There has not been any problem. But the CESC supply is yet to be restored,” an official of Peerless Hospital said around 9.30pm.An official of AMRI Hospitals in Mukundapur said “there was no problem”.The blackout came in the middle of a lockdown, prompting PWD minister Aroop Biswas to visit the spot along with mayoral council member (solid waste management) Debabrata Majumdar.Thousands of households, including standalone apartments and housing complexes off the EM Bypass, were left without power on Friday evening.Arundhati Maitra, who lives opposite Metro Cash and Carry, spent more than two hours in candlelight with her husband and daughter.“The lights went off around 5.40pm. We couldn’t even open the windows because of the mosquitoes, which are a menace in our area. The house became a furnace,” she said. Power supply was restored around 8pm.“The supply was restored in phases from 7pm. By 9pm, most areas had their supplies restored,” the CESC official said.Six tenders were sent to control the fire. The deserted roads helped in prompt response, said fire service officers. “The challenge was to contain the fire without damaging the apparatus because water is a carrier of electricity,” he said.The firefighters had to smash a glass wall with stones to spray water on the flames.Adrita Sircar, who lives in Panchasayar, said power supply to her apartment snapped around 6pm. “It was very hot. We went down and so did many others but people were wary of coming too close to each other,” she said. Power supply to her home was also restored a little before 8.30pm.",2020-03-27 20:51:00
144,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Calcutta cops feed stray dogs - Telegraph India,"Cops across the city have started feeding stray dogs, many of who survive on food provided by animal lovers in the neighbourhood.Officers of the anti-rowdy squad have formed multiple teams under an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner for the project that took off on Thursday. The police have fed nearly 250 stray dogs in two days, according to Calcutta police officers.“This is completely new to us. For the first time in my stint in this department, I have got a chance to serve the animals. Otherwise our routine duty needs us to be very rough and tough,” said an officer of the anti-rowdy squad, which specialises in tracking and arresting hardcore criminals.Senior officers at Lalbazar said the idea struck them when several organisations for animals approached the police seeking permission to feed stray animals.“We thought it was a noble idea to look after the stray animals. We have earmarked officers who are accompanying two members from each of these organisations to feed stray animals. Apart from supporting these organisations, we have set up teams for this work,” the officer said.Multiple teams — comprising not more than two or three members — fanned across the city to feed stray dogs in the city from Thursday.Each team is trying to cover stretches and feed rice and biscuits to stray dogs over six to eight hours a day.Officers of several police stations in eastern suburban division also fed stray dogs on Friday night.",2020-03-27 20:52:00
145,PTI,Coronavirus in West Bengal: Alipore Zoo animals seem cheerful in absence of visitors - Telegraph India,"The three-week-long lockdown might have made people annoyed being forced to stay indoors, but this has become a boon to the inmates of the Kolkata zoo as there is nobody to disturb the animals now and they appear to be cheerful.After the authorities of the Alipur Zoological Garden barred entry of visitors on March 17 to avoid large gatherings, the compound has become unusually empty.Over 6,000 people had visited the zoo on the last Sunday, March 15, before its closure.The 1,270 odd animals such as tigers, lions, elephants, zebras, giraffes, reptiles and birds are being taken good care of by only a handful employee mainly those who feed them, a senior zoo official told PTI on Saturday.'With the number of visitors coming to zero, the animals - especially tigers, chimpanzees and zebras - are not facing the usual crowding before their enclosures. They seem to be happy as they are not disturbed,' he said.A section of visitors to the zoos in the country are insensitive to animals, the official said adding that they indulge in forbidden activities like teasing and feeding animals.The lockdown over coronavirus outbreak did not pose any problem for procuring food for the inmates of the zoo.'We have made arrangements so that food supply for carnivores, herbivores, birds and reptiles can continue even during the lockdown period,' the official said.'The employees who are feeding the animals now are following precautions against coronavirus wearing masks and donning gloves,' he said.The deer population at the Eco Park, which is also out of bound for visitors now, is also being looked after well by the authorities.The Eco Park has nine barking deer, including a fawn born a couple of months ago, and 17 spotted deer.They are kept in separate enclosures and doing fine, one of the staff involved in the upkeep of animals there said.A top forest official said closure notices were put across all reserve forests, sanctuaries and zoological parks in West Bengal and will remain in force till the government issues another advisory.'We will meet on March 30 to review the situation,' he said.About the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and a tiger reserve, he said a footfall of 5,000-6,000 during offseason in February-March has come to zero after it was closed for visitors in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.'In any case, we don't allow tourists or any human intrusion into the mangrove forest area where tigers live during the season.

146,Kinsuk Basu,Shortage of workers hits drug supply in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The supply of medicines took a hit in several parts of the city on Saturday because of a shortage of workers at various levels in the supply chain.Medicines from manufacturers reach stores from wholesale suppliers, who source their stock from clearing and forwarding agents of drug manufacturing companies.In this supply chain, work has been affected at two places because employees were unable to get to work. As a result, medicines from the house of clearing agents did not reach wholesale dealers. Some of these agents said they didn’t have the workforce to keep stock and load medicines to match the demand of wholesalers.At the wholesale hub of medicines in Calcutta, several shop owners said they were operating with less than a fourth of their total staff strength. This means there are not enough hands to load medicines on vehicles for retailers in various parts of the city and adjoining areas as well as in the districts.“My total staff strength is 14 and I have been able to pick up only two of them in my car because they are based in Calcutta. The rest are from the suburbs; they can’t reach the shop because of transport problems,” said Abhishek Keshari, owner of a wholesale medicine shop in Mehta Building. “With just two men, how will I arrange to supply medicines to my retailers?”Mehta Building and Bagree market, with over 600 shops, account for nearly 60 per cent of the medicine business across Bengal. Over 6,000-plus retailers in the city depend largely on these two drug markets for their supplies.The supply had been hit since the lockdown till the government intervened on Friday. Shop owners in Bagree market and Mehta building resumed business on Saturday.“There are issues of manpower shortage with clearing agents,” said Saurav Hazra of Hazra Medical Agency Private Limited in Mominpore, a clearing agent. “But I have been able to manage with my staff,” he said.Many clearing agents have their offices and godowns in Andul, Dhulagarh, Amta and along stretches of Delhi Road. Medicines from manufacturers across India reach here before finding their way to wholesale dealers.Several agents said they had medicines but couldn’t distribute it. “It’s not just about trucks or Matadors. Who will load them on vehicles?” asked an agent who did not want to be named.Some medicine dealers said they had been able to overcome this crisis by hiring local hands. “Since I supply gloves to hospitals, I have ensured that supply is not hit at any cost,” said Subir Sen, owner of Garia Medical Agency. “But this is not the case with most.”A few wholesale dealers of a specific type of drugs have found a way to reach hospitals. Viren Patel, a dealer of cancer drugs in Radha Bazar, adjoining Lalbazar, said he had asked two of his staff to deliver medicines to hospitals in his car. “Since these drugs are in cartons, we are able to manage,” Patel said.",2020-03-28 20:22:00
147,Kinsuk Basu,Goods supply resumes in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Several grocery goods, including oil, salt and pulses, started trickling out of the wholesale market in Posta on Saturday as several shops and godowns opened and labourers resumed loading goods on vehicles.On Thursday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had visited Posta, one of the biggest wholesale markets in Calcutta, and requested the traders’ body to accommodate labourers who had not left for their homes at the various dharamsalas there.By Friday the arrangements had been made and on Saturday, some shops and godowns resumed trading.“We have started catering to the local markets mostly,” a wholesale trader dealing in garlic said. “Once more godowns open and more labourers resume work, we will cater to the districts. We hope by that time supply from other states will start reaching Posta and Burrabazar.”Several traders said the bulk of the shops and godowns would open on Monday and within a day or two retail markets in Calcutta and adjoining areas would be replenished.On Friday, the chief minister had spoken of Posta and said the supply chain of essential items had been kept ready.Supply of goods started picking up at Koley and Baithakkhana markets in Sealdah and the fish markets in Patipukur and Howrah.“In North and South 24-Parganas and Nadia, several traders decided to reach Calcutta with their produce,” an official of the agricultural marketing department said.“These vendors would otherwise move individually on suburban trains.”Traders who opened their shops in Maniktala, Bagmari, Lake Gardens, Jadu Babu's market and Phoolbagan said the distribution network had to strengthened further.“Potatoes are still selling at Rs 30/kg across markets. If the supply line is strengthened, this will drop to Rs 24/kg,” Bijan Das, a retailer at Bagmari market in north Calcutta, said.",2020-03-28 20:23:00
148,Subhajoy Roy,Tata Medical Center gets coronavirus test nod - Telegraph India,"The Tata Medical Center in New Town on Friday received the ICMR’s approval to conduct Covid-19 tests. It is the fifth such hospital in the city and the second private centre to get the permission.An official of the hospital, however, said on Saturday it would take at least a week to start the tests. The hospital has applied for kits but they are yet to arrive, the official said. Once the hospital is ready, it would announce the date and other necessary information on its website, he said.The official said the hospital would focus more on conducting tests on cancer patients as they “would be more vulnerable”, but it would not be exclusively meant for them. “Cancer patients would be more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection. We want to ensure their tests are not delayed. But we will conduct tests on others, too.”Samples sent by other hospitals will be tested as well. The finer details of which hospitals can send their samples will be worked out in consultation with the health department, the official said.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex biomedical research body, announced the name of the New Town hospital on Saturday.Five hospitals in the city have received the nod to conduct tests, but only two — the state government-run SSKM and the Centre-run National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) — have been tests till Saturday. The School of Tropical Medicine, the other state government-run hospital which has been permitted to do the tests, will start doing so from Monday, an official of the hospital said. The official said kits had reached the hospital and the available infrastructure would allow them to test 20 samples every day.Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, the other private hospital that has received the ICMR’s nod to do tests, is still to receive kits and are unlikely to start tests soon.A health department official said it was necessary to allow more hospitals to conduct the tests to reduce the burden on the few centres currently doing the tests.A few more private hospitals and laboratories have applied for the ICMR’s permission to conduct the tests. They are still to get the approval.A National Task Force set up by the health ministry has recommended the charges for Covid-19 tests should not exceed Rs 4,500. This may include Rs 1,500 for a screening in case of suspected patients and an additional Rs 3,000 for a confirmatory test, according to ICMR guidelines for private hospitals issued on March 21. The tests can be conducted only “when prescribed by a qualified physician according to ICMR guidelines”, the notice said.",2020-03-28 20:27:00
149,Manasi Shah,Eyeless in water - Telegraph India,"The documentary being screened at Calcutta’s Max Mueller Bhavan that day is called Swimming Through The Darkness. It is based on the life and achievements of swimmer Kanai Lal Chakraborty. One of the scenes shows Kanai and coach Chinmoy Das near a pond. Kanai is wearing swimming goggles. He does warm-up exercises before diving into the pond. Chinmoy is heard screaming, “There is algal bloom, go straight, turn right, now straight, slightly towards your left…” From time to time, Kanai’s head bobs up and he shouts to ask if he is going in the right direction and then Chinmoy screams directions yet again. “Left. Now, right. Shoja, shoja… straight, straight.”Kanai, who lost his sight due to a medical procedure gone wrong when he was a child, is an accidental swimmer. He was born and brought up in Krishnagar. When he was five years old,  he was pushed into a pond by another child. Had it not been for his elder sister, Meena, who shouted out instructions at him that day about how to stay afloat, he would have drowned. In his child’s mind the episode triggered something. He learnt to swim and this saved him from drowning, quite literally and metaphorically too.Kanai says, “Others can watch and learn, but people like us need someone who will teach every single stroke, every single move.” Chinmoy, who is present at the documentary screening along with his protégé, tells The Telegraph, “Unlike others, who can do freestyle swimming, he must only do the breaststroke. In freestyle, the swimmer’s ear goes under water with every stroke; this means he won’t be able to hear my instructions and he will deviate… He has to learn his strokes simply by imagining.” Kanai does not just imagine, he also dreams. “I am not satisfied,” he says. “I like to do long distance swimming. I want to cross the English Channel someday,” he adds.Kanai’s parents have long been dead. He lives with his brother, Ashok, who is a priest, and his wife. Ashok tells Kanai people like them should not nurture such impossible dreams. Says Kanai, “But I ask him if I quit swimming, what will my identity be?”When he is not swimming, Kanai sells spices — cumin, coriander, turmeric — from door to door to supplement a meagre family income. He practises for three to four hours every day and, during competitions up to eight hours. No luxury of following special diets, all he can afford is a fistful of black gram soaked in water, before practice.Kanai’s life is just like everyone else’s. He loves watching Bengali films, used to write poetry and act in plays. He can play the mouth organ. National Award-winning director Supriyo Sen, who made the 76-minute documentary on him, says Kanai made a conscious choice not to play the instrument for a living. “He is very poised, even though he comes from a very poor background… That kind of courage, his kind of dignity and resilience attracted me to make this documentary,” says Sen. “After a point, he does not think of himself as a blind person. And after a point, even I forgot that he is blind. He would tell me, ‘Supriyo, I have seen this cinema and that cinema’,” Sen continues.While the world premiere of the documentary won a ticket to the 23rd Busan International Film Festival in South Korea in 2018, Kanai’s dream of crossing the English Channel remains unfulfilled. Despite seeking support and help from ministries and concerned authorities, he has found no sponsor.But there are other silver linings. Inspired by his feats, his alma mater — the Helen Keller Blind School — requested him to be a sports instructor. This was some years ago and today, Kanai holds a part-time job at the school.In one of the scenes in the documentary, he is seen encouraging some of his students. He is saying, “We have to fight and establish our existence in society. We will not do what others do. We have to set examples. And only that will force society to recognise us.”",2020-03-28 20:28:00
150,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Calcutta schools put nursery admissions on hold - Telegraph India,"Several schools in the city have kept their nursery admissions on hold because of the lockdown.Some schools were in the middle of the admission process and have now either put up notices on their websites or emailed parents that the process will resume once the lockdown is lifted.La Martiniere for Girls, La Martiniere for Boys, St James’ School, South City International School are some of the institutes where admissions have been deferred.At the La Martiniere schools, the interaction with parents and children is mostly over; a few are left. “Everything is on hold now because of the lockdown. We will start the process only when the schools reopen,” Supriyo Dhar, secretary of the La Martiniere schools, said.The interaction is followed by shortlisting candidates and mailing parents about selections.St James’ School was in the middle of admissions when the lockdown for the coronavirus was announced.The school on March 25 put up a notice addressed by the principal on its website. “Admissions will continue after April 16, 2020.” Those who have been selected have to visit the school office from April 16, according to the notice. “It may change if the government extends the lockdown.”“Our selection letters for nursery have gone to parents and admissions are over for close to 75 per cent of the candidates. Whatever is left will be done after the lockdown is lifted,” Terence Ireland, principal of St James’, said.In most schools, the new session begins in April but several heads said they would be able to take a decision only after schools reopen after the lockdown is lifted.In South City International School, the admission process was stopped before the lockdown.Principal John Bagul said the school had to suspend all interviews because he did not want outsiders on the campus. There are many parents who have been transferred from other cities or have landed in the city from other countries and settled in the South City towers, he said. “They are writing to us seeking admissions but I cannot give them any assurance during the lockdown.”",2020-03-28 20:37:00
151,Our Special Correspondent,Xavier’s goes for online MBA admissions - Telegraph India,"St Xavier’s University will conduct admissions to its MBA course for the 2020 academic session online because of the coronavirus outbreak.Group discussions and personal interviews to screen aspiring students will be held using various virtual platforms, Father Felix Raj, vice-chancellor of the university, said on Saturday.Online group discussions and personal interviews will start on Sunday. “The admission process consisting of group discussions, personal interviews and tests are being done online this time. A schedule has been announced to all applicants,” the vice-chancellor said.After attending the group discussions and personal interviews, students will have to take an online written test, he said. The test will be different from the ones held in the previous years, he said.Since the admission process will be held online, the question pattern of the written test and the group discussions and personal interviews will be “slightly different”, he said. But the basic requirement an aspiring candidate needs to fulfil for a management course will be examined even during the online admission process.For every 50 applicants, a teacher has been assigned to oversee group discussions, interview sessions and written tests. Teachers will have to send the reports to the vice-chancellor.The final selection will be done based on students’ performances in group discussions, personal interviews, written tests admission tests apart from their school academic records, a university official said.The St Xavier’s University, modelled on XLRI Jamshedpur, started operating in 2018 with the first batch of MBA students. The B-school, which is part of the university's 17-acre campus in New Town, offers 120 seats in its MBA course. At least 400 students have applied for the MBA course this year.The group discussions and personal interview sessions were originally scheduled to start from March 21.The admission process had to be delayed because of the lockdown. 'We decided to conduct the MBA admissions online to avoid further delay,' the vice-chancellor said.The new session of the two-year MBA course is scheduled to start from July.",2020-03-28 20:37:00
152,Biswanath Ghosh Dastidar,"Coronavirus, pregnancy, and in vitro fertilisation - Telegraph India","The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted every sphere of life as we know it. Our understanding of the disease and its causative agent (the SARS-COV-2ssRNAb-coronavirus 2B) is limited. However, it is known that several viral infections may have severe consequences upon pregnancy. Thus, it is necessary to consider the impact that this disease may have on maternal and fetal well-being and eventual pregnancy outcome. Around 80 per cent of Covid-19 patients have fever and mild symptoms (with or without pneumonia). Severe disease, including dyspnea and lung, affects around 14 per cent patients and 5 per cent of patients are critical (respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ dysfunction). Mortality rate is 1-2 per cent. Most deaths appear to occur in the second week of illness and are associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Covid-19 is a novel infection and thus host immunity is minimal in our population.Therefore, it is more contagious than the flu, impacts the lungs differently, with a mortality rate that is 10-15 times that of the flu. Its transmission dynamics are still not fully understood and recent evidence seems to indicate possible transmission by the faeco-oral route. There is no vaccine and no specific medications yet, and treatment is supportive. The current advice and guidelines published by nodal professional bodies in the UK and the US are based on a combination of good practice principles, expert advice and scientific evidence, where available. These are likely to evolve as data is accrued, and healthcare professionals would do well to stay updated over the coming weeks and months. This article is primarily meant to benefit women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy and hospital administration, and provide healthcare professionals with an introduction to this emerging clinical scenario. Pregnant women do not appear to be at increased risk to contract the infection when compared with the general population and they need to follow widely circulated preventive guidelines. The majority of pregnant women with Covid-19 are likely to be asymptomatic, or exhibit mild to moderate flu-like symptoms, occasionally including cough, fever or shortness of breath. However, immune-adaptation of pregnancy may result in more severe symptoms in a sub-set of women, particularly after 28 weeks of gestation in the third trimester. These may include pneumonia or hypoxia and require prompt medical intervention.There is no evidence to suggest vertical transmission to the fetus at present. All recommended measures to prevent human to human transmission must be strictly followed in healthcare set-ups offering care to pregnant women.There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage, early pregnancy loss, second trimester loss, or congenital defects in the fetus. However, there have been reports of pre-term births in Covid-19 positive women, although further studies are required before any conclusive associations can be established.Ante-natal and post-natal care of pregnancy is an essential service and must continue as scheduled between the pregnant woman and the doctor, unless she meets the criteria for self-isolation of individuals or households with symptoms such as cough or fever. Online or phone appointments for providing such care may be utilised with caution to reduce the number of in- person visits, where appropriate.In suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19, routine appointments should be delayed until after the required period of self-isolation. Urgent appointments (fetal medicine indications, high risk pregnancies etc.) need to be individualised and reviewed by obstetricians in order to ensure appropriate management. When visits to the doctor are necessary, the patient should be encouraged to use private vehicles and met at the point of entry by staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). The patient should be taken to an isolation room for consultation or investigation. Such an isolation room should be equipped only with minimum essential equipment (including ultrasound machine), which should be suitably sanitised following every visit.Symptomatic women should be tested for Covid-19 according to guidelines and treated as infected until test results prove otherwise. In case of severe symptoms of Covid-19 in a pregnant patient, chest X-ray and CT scan of the chest should be performed with abdominal shielding, and not delayed because of fetal concerns. During an obstetric emergency, staff must wear PPE and isolate the patient from other pregnant women first and then manage the obstetric emergency as a priority, without waiting for the Covid-19 test.Intra-partum care for women with current or suspected Covid-19 in labour should take place in isolation rooms following a multi-disciplinary team approach involving a medical or infectious disease specialist. Healthcare workers should wear PPE during delivery of care. Maternal vital signs should be recorded periodically and electronic fetal monitoring is recommended, where available. Any sepsis should be treated according to current protocols and Covid-19 should be suspected. The number of staff members or family members around the patient should be minimised. Mode of delivery should be determined by obstetric indications. There is no evidence yet to suggest that steroids for fetal lung maturation are contra-indicated in the context of Covid-19. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) do not currently recommend separation of the newborn from the Covid-19 positive mother. Breast-feeding is also currently permitted based on risk-benefit analysis, if proper precautions are followed. These include hand-washing, avoiding coughing or sneezing while feeding, preferably wearing a face-mask, thorough cleaning of breast-pumps and preferably requesting a relative to feed expressed milk to the baby.In the Indian context, it is perhaps best to tailor these decisions on an individual basis following discussion between the doctor and the patient.Because of unknown impact on fertility and early pregnancy, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) recommends suspension of all new in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) stimulation cycles as well as elective surgeries and non-urgent diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, it urges IVF practices to strongly consider cancelling both fresh as well as frozen embryo transfers for the time being. However, stimulation cycles already in progress may be completed, as well as patients who require urgent stimulation or cryopreservation cycles because of cancer therapy. It is clear that medical practice looks set to change forever in our post-Covid-19 world. Doctors belonging to all specialities need to maintain constant surveillance for possible transmission of infection and be trained in infection control and prevention measures. Obstetricians, gynaecologists and fertility specialists are no exceptions.

153,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Get essential service e-pass in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Police on Saturday started the process of issuing e-passes to essential service providers to maintain the free flow of essential goods across the city.The passes will be issued to individuals or organisations engaged in the supply of essential goods and will be valid across the state, police said.The move came a day after chief minister Mamata Banerjee had asked the police to exercise restraint and use discretion and allow people to buy medicines and groceries and not to stop government officials from stepping out of their homes for duty.Cops have been accused of not stopping essential service providers and those engaged in online deliveries in a bid to enforce the lockdown.The chief minister had told the police to issue passes that would be recognised across the state so that vendors don’t get harassed while travelling from one police jurisdiction to another.For example, if a vendor starts from Hooghly and targets to deliver essential goods in South 24-Parganas, he/she will have to pass through Hooghly, Howrah (rural), Howrah city police and Calcutta police jurisdictions before entering South 24-Parganas.The state police top brass has instructed all districts to ensure unrestricted movement of essential service providers, according to Nabanna sources. Identical passes from police stations will be accepted across the state.Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma on Saturday launched the e-passes that can be downloaded online: https://coronapass.kolkatapolice.org.Individuals or organisations can apply for the passes, according to officers in Lalbazar. But it will be issued only to those who can substantiate their status as an essential service provider through proper documents.“There will be strict scrutiny before issuing the passes because once these passes are issued, everyone will start claiming that they are engaged in essential service,” an officer said. While filling up the application form, a person will have to mention the nature of his/her emergency duty, if he/she is engaged in the supply of essential goods or medicines or if he/she is engaged in e-commerce.An applicant will have to provide his/her name, address, along with details of the vehicle and route of operation, before uploading his/her photograph. Applicants will have to upload specific documents to prove their purpose before submitting the form online.“Only those who fulfil every criteria will be issued an e-pass through email. These passes will be non-transferable and will not be effective if used outside the route of operation as declared in the application,” an officer said.Bengal police will soon introduce identical passes in all districts that can be obtained from the local police station after submission of relevant forms and documents.",2020-03-28 21:49:00
154,Pranesh Sarkar,Coronavirus lockdown: Ordinance planned on Calcutta civic rule - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government is all set to promulgate an ordinance for appointment of an administrator at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as the existing law doesn’t provide for such a mechanism at the civic body in the state capital.The decision was taken following a realisation that because of the lockdown, it was impossible to hold polls to the civic body before May 8 when the five-year-term of the current board would expire.“Primarily, no clause was found in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, to appoint an administrator. A file has been moved to the advocate general for a way out. The state government would act as per the advice of the advocate general,” said a senior state government official.Sources said it was primarily decided that elections to the CMC would be conducted on April 19 and the state election commission had started proceedings accordingly. “But now, it appears that the government as well as the election commission would not be able to hold the CMC polls before the tenure of the existing board expires. Even if the lockdown is completely lifted on April 15, there would not be enough time to hold the polls before May 8,” said another official.The lockdown and the spread of the novel coronavirus made fate of 100-odd other civic bodies in Bengal also uncertain. Their tenure had already expired or will be over in May. “We don’t know when the social distancing advisory would be lifted completely. It may be dragged beyond May as the situation is not expected to improve overnight. Until the social distancing advisory is lifted completely, it is not possible to hold polls,” said a source.If the polls could not be held by first week of June, then it will almost be impossible to conduct the elections in the following months.

156,Subhankar Chowdhury,New Alipore model for entire Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The city police have asked all police stations to follow New Alipore police station’s model of delivering essentials at the doorstep of residents “wherever feasible” so that they need not go to the market.The Telegraph had on Sunday reported that New Alipore police station had introduced a system by which residents of the area under its control will have essentials such as vegetables and groceries delivered home and they would not have to visit the markets.The police station has contacted vendors of essential items at the New Alipore and Gholsapur markets before rolling out the service.A senior officer at the city police headquarters in Lalbazar told this newspaper that a message had been sent to all police stations, asking them to follow the New Alipore model “wherever feasible”.“The model implemented by New Alipore police station has been quite successful. This has helped thin crowds at markets, which is a must to combat the spread of the coronavirus. We hope the other police stations would start implementing it,” he said.Calcutta police has 79 police stations under its jurisdiction.Sources at the police headquarters said the mechanism of home delivery of essentials being followed by New Alipore police station has been WhatsApped to the inspectors of the other police stations.New Alipore police station covers a smaller area than many police stations in the city. The ones that are in charge of bigger areas have been advised to design the delivery mechanism keeping in mind the ground reality.Officers also stressed that the facility was just an additional option for residents who did not want to step out. People who need to go out and buy essentials can still do it. The police, an officer said, is more concerned about elderly people visiting markets. “This age group is most vulnerable,” he said.In several counties in the US, which is fast emerging as the Covid-19 hotspot, the police have started the practice of delivering essentials at the doorstep of elderly people.New Alipore police station has created a database of vendors, along with their mobile numbers, and shared it on a WhatsApp group that has 3,760 residents of the area as members. The members are being encouraged to share the numbers with residents who are not part of the group.After placing an order, a resident is keeping one of the four sub-inspectors of the police station informed.

157,Kinsuk Basu,CMC's drive for blood collection - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will draw up a list of those willing to donate blood to help tackle the acute shortage blood banks have been facing following the Covid-19 outbreak, civic officials said on Sunday. Blood banks primarily source blood from donation camps, which cannot be organised in the lockdown.Clubs, NGOs and other social outfits will be approached for donors. The civic body will arrange for the transportation of donors to and from blood banks. Senior officials of the corporation have already held preliminary talks with a few state-run blood banks and the blood collection is expected to take off next week.“The aim is to address the shortage of blood,” deputy mayor Atin Ghosh told Metro. “We have spoken to a few blood banks. We will also reach out on social networking platforms and hopefully by next week, the process will begin.” Some of the major blood banks across Calcutta require around 90 to 100 units of blood every day and this March. Blood banks usually face a crisis in summer, when the number of donation camps drops.But this year banks are already running dry because of a clampdown on mass gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The health department issued a circular allowing only 30 donors at a donation camp with five allowed to donate at a time. The donors would have to maintain social distancing. But few donors turned up.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee then asked the corporation to take immediate steps to replenish the stock of blood banks, sources said.“The requirement for blood is less because the patient inflow at medical colleges has come down,' said Malay Ghosh, the director of the blood bank at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. 'But even then we will require blood as the stocks are at their lowest. We have already had a round of discussion with corporation officials.”Several blood banks welcomed the civic body's move. “Apart from patients of thalassaemia, who need regular blood transfusion, there are emergency cases as well and blood bank must be well-stocked at all times,” said Pratik Dey, the head of the blood bank at the SSKM Hospital.",2020-03-29 20:50:00

Let us seek such persons in our neighbourhood or parish, irrespective of their religion or language. Let us recognise the face of the suffering Jesus in each one of them and help them,” archbishop Thomas D’Souza said in a circular.“This will make our Lent fruitful and Easter filled with hope for all. Parish priests are requested to coordinate requests for assistance (financial/material) through the Parish and Seva Kendra Calcutta (social service unit of the archdiocese).”Several organisations and individuals are coming out to help the poor during the lockdown. “We cannot come out directly but can use the social communication to provide assistance. There can be some requests which can be handled at the level of parish priests and in some where the parish priests can get in touch with our social service unit, Seva Kendra. The state government is doing but it is a mammoth work and we need to coordinate efforts to help the poor,” the archbishop told Metro.Church officials said social distancing must be maintained even while rendering help.“The situation is such that we have to reach out to people who need help and be sensitive to their plight, irrespective of religion,” said Father Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the archdiocese of Calcutta.In the circular to the clergy and the laity, the archbishop has once again made the “stay home-wash hand-safe distance” appeal.The Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India has decided to provide two meals to 100 individuals at a temporary shelter in Kalighat for the next 10 days.

161,Monalisa Chaudhuri And Jhinuk Mazumdar,Alzheimer’s patient found dead on road in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A 91-year-old Alzheimer’s patient, tired of being confined at home because of the lockdown, stepped out of the house in Entally on Sunday morning and was found dead on the road a few hours later.His son searched for him for hours before alerting police. He finally came to know from a group of neighbourhood youths that his father was lying on the road, unconscious and bleeding.By the time the son reached the spot, around a kilometre from the house, his father was dead. The elderly man had possibly tripped and fallen on the road and died on the spot. No one had touched him or come to his aid.“We took him to a government hospital where he was declared dead. Doctors said my father had a cardiac arrest,” the son told The Telegraph.“My father was an Alzheimer’s patient. He was getting tired of being at home. Today, he found a door open and stepped out unnoticed.”Officers of Entally police station had alerted nearby police stations and launched a search for the elderly man. They suspected that with no public transport available because of the lockdown, he would not have gone too far.“He was found not far from his house but he had probably been lying on the road for quite some time with no help,” an officer said.The lockdown since Monday evening has forced people to stay indoors except for buying emergency supplies.The home confinement has affected the young and old alike, who are struggling to cope with the sudden change in their daily lives.The elderly are usually the most affected, doctor said. For them, any drastic change in routine and lifestyle can lead to more confusion and family members of elderly people, especially those with dementia, must be mindful of the change, psychiatrists said.“The elderly, because of their decreased ability to process information, do not adapt to drastic changes well. Those above 90 may have limited understanding of the changes in daily life (currently because of lockdown) and have more propensity to get lost. There are instances where they wander away from home and get lost,” psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram said.Police suggested that family members of dementia patients should keep an identity card with the patient to help others guide them home in case they are lost. The card should mention the name, address and phone number of a family member who can be contacted in an emergency.Police also advised that if such patients go missing from home, the family members should immediately alert the police without wasting time.Psychiatrist Rima Mukherji said it was not unnatural for caregivers to be stressed and one must take breaks, too.“The caregiver is also multi-tasking. He or she is working from home and doing other chores and there are times when they are in a situation when the caregiver is stressed and so they can ask others in the family to help them take care of the person in shifts,” Mukherji said.Psychiatrists suggest talking to the elderly about the situation and constantly reminding them about the restrictions.“A routine or structure has to be maintained for the elderly, especially those with dementia. Since children are now at home, they can be engaged to be nannies to their grandparents in the absence of attendants,” Ram said.",2020-03-29 20:54:00
162,Subhasish Chaudhuri And Subhajoy Roy,Constable of CISF volunteers information - Telegraph India,"A woman constable of CISF from Katwa in East Burdwan voluntarily told the Nadia administration on Sunday that she had probably travelled with four of the five Covid-19 patients from Nadia’s Tehatta by a Lalgola Passenger train from Sealdah on March 20.The 28-year-old woman, who travelled in a coach for the physically challenged, voluntarily contacted the district administration following an appeal to those who might have come in close contact with the five to get in touch with the authorities, health department officials said.Other than her, no one has come forward in response to the appeal, the officials said.The constable, from Char Chakrabirajpur near Katwa and posted with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, visited a government hospital in Nadia’s Krishnagar on Sunday.Doctors at the hospital did not find any Covid-19 symptom in her but she was still sent to a government quarantine facility at a village about 5km from Krishnagar as a precaution.She had visited a government hospital in Katwa on March 21, the day after she travelled by the Lalgola Passenger, as a precautionary measure since she had arrived from Delhi.The state government has advised all people entering Bengal, from other states or abroad, to be in home quarantine for 14 days.“I knew about the advice to stay in home quarantine, which is applicable even to those who are arriving from within the country. So, I went to the Katwa hospital for a check-up. The doctors there advised me to stay in home quarantine,” she said.While being quarantined at home, the constable came to know about the four patients from Tehatta and the fact that they had travelled by a Lalgola Passenger from Sealdah to Bethuadahari on March 20.She also came to know from news reports that the two of the patients were kids aged 6 years and 9 months.“Four passengers with masks were travelling in the same compartment as me. My contact with the team was restricted to a child, aged around 6, who was seated beside me. I touched him a number of times,” the woman said.She said she was in a compartment meant for the physically challenged and attached to the women’s compartment of the train.“The four got off at Bethuadahari,” the constable said.District health officials had said that the four patients — all related — had arrived in Sealdah from Delhi by the Rajdhani Express on March 20 and boarded the Lalgola Passenger that left Sealdah at 10.28am.They got off at Bethuadahari and reached Barnia in Tehatta by an autorickshaw.The four had been advised home quarantine in Delhi after officials learnt that they had come in contact with a male relative who had arrived from abroad and tested positive.“They jumped home quarantine and boarded a train for Calcutta,” an official said.At Barnia, the four had attended a family event. The fifth patient — an 11-year-old boy — is a relative of the four and a resident of Nadia.All five have been admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital. Two of them are women aged 45 and 27 and two others are girls aged 6 years and 9 months.Based on information provided by residents and family members, the administration has prepared a list of 49 persons who might have come in close contact with the patients. “Each person is being asked about his or her contact with the patients,” said an official of the district.On Saturday, the administration had appealed to people in the vicinity who might have come in contact with the patients to identify themselves so that chances of a community outbreak of the coronavirus could be minimised.However, except the woman constable, no one had come forward.The authorities in Tehatta have begun scanning the area to track down suspected carriers of the virus. But till Sunday evening, no such individual could be traced.“We scanned the entire vicinity. The good news is no fresh case was reported today. We will continue the scanning,” Tehatta sub-divisional officer Aneesh Dasgupta said.The district administration has launched a drive to disinfect the area with sodium hypochlorite solution sent by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. “The CMC has provided us 9,000 litres of sodium hypochlorite along with the jet spray vehicle,” an official said.An official of the state health department said three close contacts of the five patients have been admitted to a government hospital in south Calcutta. “Their samples will be sent for tests on Monday,” said the official.",2020-03-29 20:55:00

Neither has tested positive for the virus.Officials said samples of eight patients admitted at the Beleghata hospital, including those of the teenager, were sent for tests on Saturday. All but one were positive.Among the eight are a 22-year-old youth from south Calcutta, who tested positive for the first time on March 19, days after returning from the UK, and his parents and a help of the family. The parents and the help tested positive on March 22 and are being treated at the Beleghata hospital.Also among the eight who were tested on Saturday was a 23-year-old woman from Habra in South 24-Parganas, who had first tested positive after returning from Scotland. She was sent to the Beleghata hospital directly from the airport after airport officials saw her coughing and she said she was feeling feverish. A 58-year-old man who had returned from Egypt and a 55-year-old woman back from the UK were also tested.",2020-03-29 20:55:00
164,Subhajoy Roy And Angshuman Phadikar,"Coronavirus outbreak: Army doctor, 2 others test positive in Kolkata - Telegraph India","Three men tested positive for Covid-19 in Calcutta on Sunday, taking the number of patients in Bengal to 21, a state health department official said.One of them, a 52-year-old anaesthetist with an army hospital, had returned to the city from Delhi on March 17, according to civic officials who have the job of tracing the contacts of all Covid-19 patients in Calcutta.An army official in Delhi said the anaesthetist, a colonel, may have come in contact with someone who had travelled abroad. “Those he has treated at the military hospital have also been quarantined,” he said.Another of the new patients, a 66-year-old resident of Baranagar, had been admitted to a private nursing home in north Calcutta on March 26 with fever and respiratory distress.An official at the nursing home said he was being shifted to the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital on Sunday night.The patient has no travel history but his 60-year-old brother, who recently got admitted to a private hospital in southeast Calcutta with stomach ache, had returned from Madhya Pradesh shortly before.An official of the southeast Calcutta hospital said the patient had been shifted to an isolation ward and a swab would be collected and sent for a coronavirus test on Monday. He currently has no symptoms of Covid-19.“Now that his elder brother has tested positive, we cannot take any chances,” the hospital official said.The third patient to test positive for Covid-19 on Sunday is a 59-year-old from Seoraphuli in Hooghly, who had got admitted to a private hospital in Salt Lake on Saturday with fever and cough.An official at the Salt Lake hospital said the patient had had fever since March 16 along with “slight respiratory trouble, which increased since March 22”.“The patient is diabetic and hypertensive. He had travelled to Durgapur before March 16. He is currently in ICCU isolation with respiratory distress,” the official said.It’s unclear whether the patient had any travel history outside Bengal, health department officials said.The condition of a critical Covid-19 patient, a 66-year-old Nayabad resident admitted to a private hospital in southeast Calcutta, remained almost similar with only marginal improvements since Saturday.“There’s no worsening but he is still critical,” a hospital official said.He said the patient’s “urine output” had improved on Sunday evening. “There’s no increased demand for oxygen. He is maintaining his blood pressure and there’s no new infection in his lungs. His heart rate is normal,” the official said.The man’s wife and daughter, in quarantine at a government hospital in south Calcutta because they had come in close contact with him, have tested negative.A health official said they would undergo a second round of tests soon. The national policy says that close contacts of positive cases must test negative twice within 48 hours before they can be discharged, he said.The man had travelled to Egra in East Midnapore to attend a wedding on March 12. After the festivities ended, he and his wife made a short trip to Digha.On returning to Egra, the man was examined by a local physician. When his respiratory distress worsened he was brought to Calcutta on March 23 and admitted to the southeast Calcutta hospital the same day. He tested positive for Covid-19 the next day.Health officials at Egra said four contacts had been put in quarantine at the Egra Super-speciality Hospital on Sunday. Three of them had worked as domestic help during the wedding and the fourth, a wedding guest, had already been quarantined at a local school and developed symptoms.Two women who were at the wedding and tested positive on Saturday were brought to the Beleghata ID Hospital on Sunday.Army officials said a junior commissioned officer in Dehradun too tested positive on Sunday, taking the number of Covid-19 patients in the army to three.“Both the patients (Calcutta colonel and Dehradun JCO) are stable,” a source at army headquarters said.Earlier, a 34-year-old soldier whose father had travelled to Iran last month had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

165,Jayanta Basu,Nailed: Diesel role in air pollution - Telegraph India,"The ongoing lockdown to fight the novel coronavirus has not only sharply reduced Calcutta’s air pollution level but has also underlined the pivotal role played by diesel-powered vehicles in making the city’s air toxic, according to a study by the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment.The study has considered the peak values every hour of two major pollutants — PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide — recorded by seven automatic air pollution measuring stations in the city.Both PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide cause severe respiratory ailments. PM2.5, the deadliest of all air pollutants, are ultra-fine particles that can get lodged in the deepest crevices of the lungs and cause a host of ailments, including cancer.The study shows that peak levels of PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide have dropped by 46 and 74 per cent, respectively, during the lockdown compared with the pre-lockdown days. The lockdown in Calcutta, along with much of the rest of Bengal, kicked in at 5pm on March 23. The national lockdown took effect from midnight of March 24.The hourly peak value average of PM2.5 on March 18 and 19 in Calcutta had reached 96.4 microgram per cubic metre. Post-lockdown, the average peak value on March 25 and 26 dropped to 51 microgram.Similarly, the average hourly peak level of nitrogen dioxide dropped from 71 microgram (March 18-19) to 18.4 (March 25-26).“The analysis shows that the hourly pollution peaks have nearly flattened out after the lockdown, highlighting the role of traffic in Calcutta’s air pollution,” said Anumita Roy Choudhury of the CSE, who led the study. She pointed out that the peak levels of nitrogen dioxide, being more directly linked to emission from diesel-powered vehicles, have dropped more sharply than PM2.5, which is influenced by other sources, too.Roy Choudhury admitted that such low pollutant values would not sustain in Calcutta once the lockdown is lifted and stressed that the coronavirus pandemic should make governments and people sit up and recognise the importance of public health emergencies such as air pollution and taking steps to stem its rise.She listed the actions the city needs to take to counter air pollution from various emission sectors. “In transportation, Calcutta needs integrated and scaled-up public transport system, expansion of electricity-driven public transport options such as trams, Metro Railway, Circular Railway, and introduction of more electric buses, enhancement of water transport, and most importantly replacement of diesel-powered vehicles with ones that run on the environment-friendly Compressed Natural Gas,” she said.“The construction sector has to strictly abide by the environment norms, coal consumption needs to be minimised and use of solar roof-top panels should be encouraged,” Roy Choudhury said.Environment activist Subhas Dutta hoped that the coronavirus emergency should make  governments realise the importance of taking actions to counter the impact of air pollution on public health.",2020-03-30 20:28:00
166,Jhinuk Mazumdar,State commission's routine for kids  - Telegraph India,"The state commission for protection of child rights has published a routine for children to keep them happy during the lockdown.Live in the “now”, be positive and stay connected with one another, is the panel’s advice.  The commission has suggested a list of activities on its website and social media. “There is a certain anxiety among children and regular activity will keep them occupied and help them counter the anxiety,” said Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti, the chairperson of West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The commission has said that managing children is a real challenge for parents and “a planned activity is always better than an unplanned one in emergency”.'The routine has been divided into four segments — morning, day, evening and night. The commission has said morning activities should be light to keep the mind calm and fresh. The day can begin with deep breathing, followed by music. This can be followed by free-hand exercise and jogging in the balcony or terrace. Children can be encouraged to prepare breakfast. During the day, the child should engage in activity or spend time with parents or grandparents. They could practise handwriting, or do a puzzle or play a musical instrument among other things. Evenings should be a time for family bonding, according to the commission. “Fix a time and allow the child to talk freely. Have a receptive ear.”Children could be encouraged to play music and dance,  water plants and play board games. At night, children should be encouraged to make the bed. “A logbook may be maintained where they can write about their feelings (anxiety, worry),” the commission has said.",2020-03-30 20:28:00
167,Monalisa Chaudhuri,MLA ‘passes’ for migrants in lockdown - Telegraph India,"Many migrant labourers have been found travelling to their hometown armed with “passes” issued by MLAs during the lockdown despite government shelters being set up.The “authorisation letters” issued on purported letterheads of political leaders seek police cooperation in allowing the movement of these labourers in their jurisdiction.Movement of migrant labourers stranded because of the lockdown has been banned across the country to prevent possible inter-state or inter-district spread of Covid-19, state home department officials said.Reacting to such incidents of MLAs issuing “passes”, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday instructed the police not to take cognisance of such requests from politicians and to stick to the rules.“You don’t have to listen to any MP or MLA who have issued such letters. Everyone (migrant labourers) should stay where they are,” the chief minister said.There are 40,000 migrant labourers who are currently in Bengal and are being taken care of, she added.The movement of large number of migrant labourers without any health check-up can pose a direct threat to people where the labourers go, a health department official said.Senior officers of the police directorate said it was becoming difficult to implement the lockdown because of local MLAs who authorise such movement, which cops had been trying to restrict.The chief minister’s announcement came a few hours after a group of 66 labourers on a bus were stopped near Vivekananda Setu on Monday morning. On questioning, they told the police that they were from Metiabruz and were headed home to North Dinajpur.They apparently produced a letter from an MLA that said they were tailors from North Dinajpur.“They have been all working as tailors at Metiabruz. But now they are going to their native place at the above address,” the letter on the purported official letterhead of the MLA said.Calcutta police forced the bus and its occupants to return to Metiabruz.A group of 200-odd labourers, originally from Islampur in North Dinajpur, had returned to their homes last week carrying a purported letter from an MLA of another district. Similar letters that are marked to the police and the administration have sought “full cooperation” to ensure the labourers could return to their homes. Multiple police officers Metro spoke to said such letters defied the lockdown.Last week, the state government had announced that temporary shelters, along with food, would be arranged for the homeless and the poor, including migrant labourers, to ensure they do not travel during the lockdown.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had appealed to the chief ministers of 18 states to look after migrant labourers from Bengal stranded there.According to a directive issued by the state chief secretary, the district administration will set up shelters for migrant labourers present in Bengal.",2020-03-30 20:29:00
168,Subhankar Chowdhury And Debraj Mitra,Calcutta citizens arrange food for poor - Telegraph India,"People living in shanties near Dhakuria railway station got bowls of hot khichdi on Monday afternoon. The mutiyas (men who ferry goods by van) of Burrabazar got cereals, pulses and biscuits the day before. The lockdown enforced by the novel coronavirus has robbed thousands of people of their daily labour and, consequently, two square meals. But from young students to social activists, people across the city have extended a helping hand to feed as many as they can.JadavpurThe parking lot near gate number 4 of Jadavpur University has turned into a kitchen, helmed by students and researchers, to feed the poor and destitute people in neighbouring areas.“We have stocked up 200kg of rice, 60kg of pulses and proportionate amounts of potato and onion to prepare khichdi. Our volunteers have hired cycle-vans and e-rickshaws to ferry the food in the afternoon. The rickshaw-pullers and van-drivers are also being fed,” said Debjan Sengupta, a student of comparative literature.On Day 1, the students delivered food to over 150 people - living in shanties near Jadavpur and Dhakuria stations and under the Gariahat flyover. “In the coming days, we will also serve food to people in areas like Kasba, Garfa, Santoshpur, Sulekha, Baghajatin and Bijoygarh,” said an organiser. The organisers have taken to crowd-funding to raise money for the kitchen. So far, they have spent around Rs 20,000 to buy essentials and hire vehicles for delivery. The organisers planned to deliver 10kg of khichdi every day and continue the service till April 15. The nationwide lockdown is to end on April 14. While serving food, the students are also running a campaign on maintaining basic hygiene.BurrabazarAround 12km away, in Burrabazar’s Canning Street area, members of an NGO have come forward to arrange ration for mutiyas.The members collected cereals, pulses, potatoes and onions from Chetla Agrani Club, associated with mayor Firhad Hakim, and distributed 5kg each among 25-odd persons on Sunday afternoon.Canning Street is one of the busiest wholesale markets in eastern India, dotted by thousands of shops that sell costume jewellery, plastic goods, toys, stationery, rubber band and many other items.“Most people hail from Jharkhand and depend on daily wages for their survival. All shops and godowns are shut now. Their income has also disappeared,” said Raja Chatterjee of The Junglees, an NGO that has come forward to help them. “The ration should last them a few days. We plan to replenish it after that,” said Chatterjee.A small group of labourers from Murshidabad, working at an upcoming building in Behala Parnasree, also got some ration on Sunday. They have also got a temporary shelter in a house in Behala, arranged by the NGO.Zakaria StreetThe Ashka’s Foundation, a socio-cultural organisation working for the uplift of the poor, distributed food kits among around 500 distressed families in the slums of central Calcutta.Ghazala Yasmin, a member of the foundation, said each kit contained 5kg rice, 5kg flour, 1litre of mustard oil and other items such as pulses, potatoes and onions. “The items were distributed in the Kalabagan, Zakaria Street and other areas. Our volunteers took the packets on a Matador in the slum areas for distribution. We raised Rs 2.5 lakh through crowd-funding for the exercise,” said Yasmin, who works at Aliah University.",2020-03-30 20:29:00
169,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Fake news cuffs on 29-year-old in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A 29-year-old Behala resident was arrested for allegedly posting false information about the spread of Covid-19 cases in a WhatsApp group for guardians of a kindergarten school in New Alipore where her child studies.The post claimed that 15 residents of a New Alipore block had tested positive for the coronavirus and urged everyone not to step out to buy essentials.The woman has been charged under Section 505(1)(b) of IPC that deals with conducting public mischief with intent to cause or which is likely to cause fear or alarm to the public or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity. The maximum punishment for the offence could be up to three years. “It is not a forward message girls so plz don’t ignore,” read her message in the WhatsApp group with 93 members. “New Alipore had become hot spot for Corona. 15 cases have been in block P and 2 in my lane. Plz be careful everyone. Bhale daal chawal khao but don’t send any of your family members to buy veggies and fruits. This information is reliable so plz don’t be ignorant and be house arrested.”The message posted around 8pm on Sunday sparked panic.

170,Subhajoy Roy,"Hotels, hospital & delivery app unite to create 100 hotels in Calcutta - Telegraph India","Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Oyo, Lemon Tree and Zomato have come together to create 100 hotel rooms in Calcutta by next week where people can stay in isolation if they need to, officials of the companies said on Monday.The rooms are meant for those who need to stay in isolation to stop spread of the novel coronavirus but cannot do so at home because of paucity of space, the officials said.While Apollo will provide telemedicine facilities, Lemon Tree (a chain of hotels) and Oyo (online hotel aggregator) will arrange the rooms. Zomato (a food delivery platform) will deliver meals.Doctors will stay in touch with the quarantined people and shift them to hospitals if they show symptoms Covid-19 or test positive for the virus. Doctors of Apollo hospitals will be available to those in hotel quarantine over the phone. Telephonic consultation with the doctors will be free but the medicines they prescribe will be charged.“We will start with 100 rooms in Calcutta next week. We launched the project in six other cities of India on Monday. Our plan is to scale up the number of rooms by 50 to 100 every week in the country,” said Sangita Reddy, the joint managing director of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited.An official of Apollo Hospitals said finer details of how many rooms would be available in how many properties were yet to be finalised. “Once everything is final, we will upload the details on the website askapollo.com or people can also call the number 1860-500-0202 and get the details,” Reddy said.Details of how to book the rooms or who to connect will also be available on the mobile app “Apollo 247”.The six other cities where the project has been launched are Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Faridabad.Asked about the rent, Reddy said OYO would charge about Rs 1,020 and Lemon Tree would charge about Rs 3,000. The Lemon Tree tariff includes food charges but it was not sure whether OYO rates include that.The arrangements are being made as part of the “Project Stay I” initiative launched by the hospital and other partners.Earlier, the Bengal health department had listed 31 hotels in and around the city where people could stay in self-quarantine for a fee. The state government had announced that the list of hotels could be expanded and any hotel with the required infrastructure was welcome to apply to be enlisted.The state government is also planning a similar initiative in the districts. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked district officials during a video conference on Monday to make pay-and-use quarantine facilities. “People who can afford to pay should pay and stay if they want,” Mamata said. Reddy said Apollo hospitals across the country were flooded with requests from concerned people who wanted to stay in hospital quarantine after arriving from abroad or for other reasons. But many of them do not need to be in hospital. She said many of these people lived in large families where more than two persons shared a room.“These people do not have the scope to stay in home quarantine, but they have to remain quarantined. If they are kept in hospitals, it will block crucial hospital beds that would be needed by people whose health condition merits hospitalisation,” Reddy said during a virtual news conference on Monday. It was such a situation that triggered the plan to create hotel rooms for quarantine. While Oyo has several properties in the city, Lemon Tree has only one property in New Town. It was not immediately clear if part of the New Town property would be used for the quarantine facility. Ginger Hotels is a part of the project in some cities. Deutsche Bank, Hindustan Unilever Limited and the State Bank of India are the other partners of the project.",2020-03-30 20:30:00

Officials of the Covid-19 management cell in Tehatta said they did not find any symptoms in the auto driver. The driver was the second person to voluntarily come forward and admit contact with the Covid-19 positive persons. On Sunday, a woman CISF constable had got in touch with the administration, saying she might have shared the same compartment of a Lalgola Passenger train with four of the five patients on March 20.“I came to know that the district administration was looking for the auto driver who ferried four of the five persons to Barnia from Bethuadahari. Realising that I had ferried the four, I contacted officials in Tehatta. It is an issue that concerns the safety of all,” the auto driver said.Two women and three children from Tehatta, including a nine-month-old, tested positive for the novel coronavirus and were admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital. The women and two of the children, all related, had reached Sealdah from Delhi by the Rajdhani Express on March 20. They then boarded the Lalgola Passenger and got off at Bethuadahari.The fifth patient, an 11-year-old boy, is a resident of Tehatta and a relative of the four. Three persons from Nadia who came in close contact with the five are admitted to a government hospital in south Calcutta. The Nadia district administration has also identified 67 others who came in contact with any of the five.All 67 have been asked to be in home quarantine. “A written undertaking that they will not violate the order has been taken from them. Also, posters have been pasted outside their homes asking people to avoid visiting them during the two-week quarantine period,” an official in the district administration said.East Burdwan district magistrate Vijay Bharti said doctors had examined a family member of the CISF constable — she is from Katwa in the district — and put him in home quarantine.The army’s Eastern Command on Monday said it was identifying those who had come in contact with the anaesthetist who has tested positive for the virus, when he was in Delhi between March 12 and 17.

Quotations have also been sought for protective gear such as goggles, N-95 masks, disposable surgical gowns and masks, personal protective equipment (PPE) and gloves. Most of these have to be flown in from China, health department sources said.The government is also planning to procure civil epidemic prevention equipment such as daily-wear masks and forehead thermometers. A consignment of 5,000 infrared thermometers has arrived from China. Three ventilators ordered by the government of a northeastern state were flown in from Zurich on a special cargo aircraft last week, said airport officials.A SpiceJet cargo aircraft brought  277 boxes containing PPE for doctors and healthcare workers. The consignment also contained gloves, caps and shoe covers for government hospitals across the state, an official said.“There is a scarcity of infrared thermometers in the city as they have been in high demand at shopping malls, shops, private and government offices, private hospitals and nursing homes. These are mostly manufactured in China and private importing agencies are getting orders for fresh imports,” an official handling cargo at Calcutta airport said.The cargo terminal is operating all day. “We are working with reduced manpower but all our staff members are on standby,” said Rahul Nandy, deputy general manager, cargo division at Calcutta airport.Air India and its subsidiary Alliance Air are flying most of the consignments. “An Alliance Air flight from Delhi to Calcutta carried shipments for Calcutta, Guwahati, Dibrugarh and Agartala,” an Air India spokesperson said.The cargo division usually handles 130 tonnes of export and 60 tonnes of import goods every day but now that has been reduced to a few hundred kilograms, an official said.",2020-03-30 20:31:00

175,Kinsuk Basu,Plea for drug trade staff in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Medicine distributors and clearing agents have urged the state government to make arrangements to ferry those who work in godowns and shops so that drugs can be loaded and unloaded and retailers can replenish their stock.  At a meeting with health department officials on Sunday evening, wholesalers and distributors of medicines across Calcutta requested the state government to work out ways so that the staff engaged by medicine godowns and wholesale shops could be considered as “emergency work force” and brought to Calcutta from the suburbs.The traders also suggested that once these staff reached Calcutta, they should be allowed to board government buses meant for those on emergency duty. “The government has all its resources in place. We have requested them to work out something for these staff,” said  Sankha Roy Chowdhury, the president of the Bengal Chemist and Druggist Association. “Loading and unloading of medicines have been severely hit. That has affected retail supply chain of medicines.” The government is yet to respond to the plea.On Monday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked the administration to ensure supply of medicines was not disrupted. Officials were asked to see to it that supply of medicines requiring cold chain — the ones that need to be preserved at a certain low temperature — is not hampered during the lockdown. Vaccines, glaucoma eye drops, insulin and aerosol sprays are some of the key cold chain drugs and several medicine distributors had complained about their unavailability at the meeting with health department officials on Sunday. “You have to ensure that supply of cold chain medicines is not hampered. The suppliers shouldn’t be stopped at any point,” the chief minister said at a meeting with all district magistrates and police superintendents from Nabanna.Supply of medicines in general has been hit across all retail outlets in Calcutta and the districts. Distributors and clearing agents said this was primarily because of acute shortage of manpower.Across parts of Mehta Building and Bagri Market in Burrabazar, the largest wholesale hub of medicines, a handful of workers turned up on Monday for loading medicines on trucks and Matadors.“These men were demanding Rs 150 for loading one carton of drugs. Earlier, they would demand Rs 15-20,” said a wholesaler at Bagri Market.“We had asked the health department on Sunday to at least arrange for buses that would carry medicines to various places from Calcutta,” said a distributor. “We have made arrangements for a bus to leave Calcutta by Monday evening with medicines to parts of north Bengal. Another bus-load of medicines will leave for south Bengal by Tuesday,” a health department official said.",2020-03-30 20:32:00
176,Mita Mukherjee And Jhinuk Mazumdar,ICSE schools asked to start virtual classes - Telegraph India,"The ICSE council on Tuesday asked all affiliated schools to start online teaching and learning during the lockdown.The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) wants schools to make sure that the time students are spending at home is utilised effectively, according to an advisory issued by it.“In order to ensure continuity of students’ learning and effective teaching activities during the lockdown period, the council advises all its affiliated schools to make alternative arrangements, using modern and digital means of imparting education,” the advisory said.All ICSE and ISC schools have been closed since March 16 after the state government asked educational institutions in Bengal to remain shut till March 31 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The closure was later extended till April 14.The council has advised the schools to start online teaching and learning activities because most schools are yet to decide how to keep their students in touch with studies at home, a source at an ICSE school in Calcutta said.Some guardians have allegedly been complaining to schools that in the absence of routine academic activities, students were treating the closure as a “long holiday” and this was also leaving parents, who have had to manage household chores while working from home, stressed.A structured routine will keep children occupied at a time when they cannot go to school or even outdoors, psychologists said.“School is an inherent part of their lives, not only for academics but for meeting friends, laughing together, talking to each other. Many of them do not have the maturity to understand why all this has stopped all of a sudden. Routine gives them parameters within which they can function and gives them a sense of security and comfort,” said psychologist Ruvena Sanyal.Schools can give assignments, conduct online classes or distribute worksheets, a counsellor suggested. “If there is a routine set by the school, students usually tend to take it more seriously. They follow it with discipline because it will translate into marks or grades,” Sanyal said.Some school heads, however, pointed out that this time of the year is usually a transition period when the new session begins and there is not much academic pressure. “It is not right to keep giving assignments, they should be allowed some free time also. It is only after the first week of April that they get books and the new session starts,” a principal said. The principal of a school said the objective behind the advisory was to ensure that students remain in touch with academics even when they are at home. “We welcome the move. But there are some difficulties in implementing it,” the principal said.In some schools where report cards have already been handed over, preparations are on to start online classes from next week. The schools need to create a separate portal and personal user IDs and passwords for every student.“We don’t have this facility. It will be difficult for us to create the facility at this time,” said the principal.",2020-03-31 20:41:00

One was involved in the 1993 Bowbazar blast case. The remaining seven run a canteen named Khai Khai in the jail.All 12 convicts had sought permission from the correctional services department to withdraw the money citing the reason. Their plea was accepted.“This is something unique and should be encouraged. We have received some similar applications and they are being considered,” said a senior officer.One of the lifers has donated his entire savings in his “unexpendable” account, totalling Rs 14,000, to the fund. Four others have donated around Rs 27,500 together. The ones who run the canteen have given Rs 24,500.As news of the donations reached chief minister Mamata Banerjee, she asked officials of the jail department to visit the correctional home and felicitate the 12.Additional director general (correctional services) Peeyush Pandey has felicitated the inmates on behalf of the chief minister.A jail officer said they were spreading awareness about Covid-19 among the inmates.Sources in the correctional services department said inmates earned money depending on their skills.“A skilled inmate earns Rs 100 a day and a semi-skilled inmate Rs 90 a day. An unskilled one earns Rs 80 a day,” an officer said.The inmates’ income is divided into two parts — expendable and unexpendable. “The expendable income is handed over to them and they are free to spend it. The unexpendable earning is deposited in their bank accounts and they have to seek the correctional services department’s permission to withdraw the money,” an officer said.",2020-03-31 20:44:00

180,Our Special Correspondent,Architects offer building to the state to help fight coronavirus - Telegraph India,"An architects’ forum has offered a six-storey building near the Ruby crossing  to the state to help fight the novel coronavirus.The building, spanning 18,000sqft, is owned by the Bengal chapter of the Indian Institute of Architects. It stands in Santipally off the Rashbehari connector, less than a 10-minute walk from Ruby hospital.“The building comprises approximately 3,000 sq ft of floor plate on 6 floors… including one air-conditioned floor on the third floor….  we offer our building for any such activity which you might feel could come to use to the health service providers in any form possible under the circumstances,” said a letter to the chief minister from the institute’s Bengal chapter. “Since the building stands in the vicinity of multiple hospitals, it can be used as an accommodation for nurses and other caregivers.

181,Sambit Saha And  Pinak Ghosh,Salary & pension likely to be on time for govt employees - Telegraph India,"Salaried employees holding government jobs and pensioners will get their dues credited to their accounts this month and do not have to harbour any anxieties on that score.A state government functionary quelled fears about any delay in the payment of salaries or pension and said the treasury had enough funds to meet the expenditure.“Salary, wage and pension as a block has the first charge on government revenue. And it is not that difficult to arrange requisite funds. Apprehensions of any delay in payments are totally unfounded,” the official said.According to a separate source in the state administration, the state treasury has been asked to prioritise salary and pension payout over all other heads of expenditure.Meanwhile, several public sector undertakings have already released the pay orders for the salaried employees and pensioners.On Tuesday, bank officials assured that salary and pension would be credited on time.“As soon as the pay order is received, the amount will be credited to the respective accounts,” one bank official said.The lockdown precipitated by the coronavirus scare had stoked fears among pensioners about payment delays.“The branch of a PSU bank from where I draw my pension had remained shut for most of last week. It opened on Monday but there was a long queue as five persons were allowed inside at one time. I cannot stand for too long. But since I don’t have an ATM card, I will have to,” said a 68-year-old retired school teacher in Taratala.The Bengal government’s revenues have come under strain because of the lockdown.There are three major sources for the state to generate revenue: excise from sale of liquor, stamp duty on immovable property, and sales tax from petrol and diesel. It also earns GST in the form of state GST (SGST). Due to low economic activity, earnings under all these heads are likely to be down.However, a government officer said GST collections had not come down to a trickle. “Groceries and medicines are being sold in the market after all,” the official pointed out.However, banks are anticipating a massive rush at branches in the first week of April.“There is a possibility that there could be a rush from Thursday onwards,” an official said.Wednesday is the annual closing day and the banks will be shut for general public .Additional reporting by Debraj Mitra",2020-03-31 20:45:00
182,Kinsuk Basu And Subhashis Chowdhury,Please obey directives: Coronavirus survivor from Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A 24-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid-19 was discharged from the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital, along with two other patients, on Tuesday. All three tested negative two consecutive times within 48 hours.The 24-year-old, a resident of Habra in North 24-Parganas, had returned from Scotland on March 19 and was taken to the hospital from the airport. The postgraduate student of business administration has been advised to quarantine herself at home for another 14 days and alert the health department if she develops any fresh symptoms of the disease.The other two discharged during the day were an 18-year-old boy, who tested positive after returning from the UK, and a south Calcutta businessman whose son is also a Covid-19 patient.The Telegraph spoke to the woman released from the hospitalIt was around 11.30 at night when a doctor of the ID hospital told me that I had got it! I had a panic attack! I had read about the large number of deaths caused by the coronavirus in China and Italy and now I had contracted the virus.From the isolation ward, I was shifted to a cabin. I could not sleep the entire night.In the morning, several doctors and health department officials visited me in turns. Everyone told me there was nothing to be scared of. “It’s like a normal flu. You are young and healthy and you have immunity. So, nothing will happen to you,” I was told repeatedly. That helped me get over the initial panic.From that day, every morning, a doctor would come and counsel me. They would tell me that I would get cured and gradually I stopped worrying. Now I know why doctors are like gods.I had returned from Scotland to Calcutta through Mumbai on March 19. I was feeling feverish after getting down in Mumbai and when I said that to health officials there, they told me I should get myself quarantined at home after returning to Calcutta.I had taken a paracetamol at the Mumbai airport. So, after landing in Calcutta, when the fever screening was done, I didn’t have high temperature. But I told officials that I had fever and  they asked me to go to the Beleghata ID Hospital. I went there in my father’s car.My father and the driver were sent to a government quarantine facility in New Town. The next night I was told that I had tested positive.I would spend time in my hospital cabin watching Netflix and making video calls to friends. I would also speak to my parents and relatives. At the hospital, they would take my blood, stool and urine samples every day. A swab sample was collected on Sunday for tests. I was told that if the report was negative, I could go home.Last night, a doctor texted me that the test was negative. It was around 1am when a nurse told me that I would be discharged today. My neighbours gave me a warm welcome. My mother was also there to receive me. My father is still at the quarantine centre. I would like to tell everyone, please obey the lockdown directives and quarantine advice. If you violate the lockdown, we may suffer the same fate as China, Italy or the US.",2020-03-31 20:49:00
183,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Teachers reach out to pupils in need in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Teachers of a school for underprivileged children are calling up students to address their apprehensions at a time when they don’t have enough to eat and their parents can’t go out to earn.The one question that every teacher of Future Hope School calling the students has been facing is “kab khatm hoga (when will this end?)”. “Mentoring is the most important aspect of child development and parenting and more so in such unusual times. These children do not have anyone at home to tell them why this is happening and one call from the teacher can reassure them and lend psychological support,” said Sujata Sen, the CEO of Future Hope. Most of the students are children of daily wage earners. living in  tiny houses with five, six, or at times even more,  family members.In one home, the mother — a widow bringing up two daughters and a son — could only buy grocery that will last a couple of days. The woman goes door to door, selling clothes for which customers pay in instalments. “She had asked the grocer to give some items on loan but was refused,” a teacher who spoke to the mother said. The son, a Class XII student, was reluctant to share the family’s plight but the teacher suspected that they needed help and spoke to his mother. Out of work because of the lockdown, many are afraid they will not find employment even after the restrictions are lifted. Most have little or no savings.The school has been helping some of the families financially. Sen has created a record book where teachers make note of their conversations to help the school authorities understand the family’s needs.The teachers have been calling up to 200-odd day scholars aged five to 21. “We talk to them to reassure them that this is a temporary phase and it will pass. We are also conducting online classes but many do not have money to recharge their phones,” said Samrin Mumtaz, the middle school coordinator. Psychologists said it was important to reach out to people, especially those in need, in such trying times. “The marginalised feel isolated and rejected and under such circumstances their insecurity increases manifold. It is important to talk to them because they need positive thoughts. Positive thoughts will also give them the energy to fight this crisis,” psychologist Ishita Sanyal said.",2020-03-31 20:49:00
186,Kinsuk Basu,Sweet shops in Calcutta for timing tweak - Telegraph India,"Many sweet shops across Calcutta remained closed on Tuesday and many others failed to draw customers as only a handful of people stepped out of their homes in the afternoon.The state government had on Monday relaxed lockdown rules for sweet shops, allowing them to remain open between noon and 4pm. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee took the decision in response to a written appeal from owners of sweet shops, who had pointed out that closure of their units was leading to huge loss of milk across Bengal.On Tuesday, the traders sent another letter to the chief minister urging her to alter the timings and allow them to keep their shops open from 8am to 1pm. The timing, representatives of the  Paschimbanga Mistanna Byabasayee Samity said, would help customers as well as owners.  The government is yet to respond to the appeal.Bengal has over a lakh sweet shops, which collectively consume around 50 lakh litres of milk daily to produce sweets. The bulk of the supplies is sourced from villages in Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas and Nadia.In Calcutta, according to the organisation, there are more than 9,000 shops and almost all source their milk from the suburbs. Apart from sweets such as rosogolla and sandesh, they produce some other milk-based items such as paneer.The sellers had reasoned with the chief minister that closure of all sweet shops across Bengal because of the lockdown was leading to waste of lakhs of litres of milk. The cows will die unless they are milked.The state government responded on Monday by relaxing the rules and said only packed sweets could be sold and traders and customers would have to maintain social distancing to prevent spread of the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19.Several shop-owners Metro spoke to said the government had clarified to them that sweets could only be sold in packets. Customers will not be allowed to sit inside shops and eat sweets and other items such as samosa or kachori.The Paschimbanga Mistanna Byabasayee Samity mentioned in Tuesday's letter to the chief minister that hardly any customer had visited their shops on the first day because most of those who stepped out to buy essentials were back home by 9am.“It will further add to our losses if we prepare sweets and they remain unsold,” Jagannath Ghosh, the secretary of the Samity, wrote in the letter.A number of big, medium and even small sweet shops across the city kept their shutters down because the owners said they were unable to arrange transportationfor their staff, most of whom stay in suburbs. Others said it was not possible to procure cottage cheese, the basic ingredient for any sweet in Bengal, from districts at such short notice.“All my 14 employees have returned home. It is not possible to bring them back because trains are not running. I have been receiving calls throughout the afternoon from my customers and I explained to everyone why it was not possible to open the shop now,” said Pradip Nag of Bhim Nag sweet shop.Some of the traditional big names such as KC Das and Girish Chandra Dey Nakur Chandra Nandy said they would not open their shops during the lockdown, irrespective of whether cottage cheese was available or not.“The safety of the customers is foremost on our minds. We can’t risk the credibility of the brand by staying open,” said Dhiman Das, executive director of KC Das.A few others who opened their units said necessary precautions were taken to ensure customers maintained social distancing while queuing up for sweets. Several shops even arranged for hand sanitisers.At Bhowanipore, the outlet of Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick witnessed a sizable turnout. People stood in a queue. maintaining distance among themselves. and picked up their favourites after rubbing their hands with sanitiser.Similar turnouts were also visible at some shops in Jadavpur and Behala. Some of the shop-owners said they would be functioning in full strength from Wednesday.",2020-03-31 20:50:00
188,TT Bureau,Institutes donate to West Bengal State Emergency Relief Fund  - Telegraph India,"The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society has contributed Rs 51 lakh to the West Bengal State Emergency Relief Fund to combat the coronavirus outbreak.Teachers, officials and other members of the staff, along with students of the three institutions run by the society, have offered to donate individually, Miraj Shah of the society said. A second round of contribution to be generated from donations will be sent to the fund.“The society has donated Rs 51 lakh. Teachers, students and members of the staff have contributed whatever they felt like,” Shah told Metro.The Rs 51-lakh cheque has been handed over to the local councillor, Shah said.The three institutions run by the society are The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School (ICSE/ISC), The Bhawanipore Education Society College and The Bhawanipur Design Academy.Some other institutions like Calcutta Girls’ High School and Calcutta University have come forward to contribute to various relief funds to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee, vice-chancellor of Calcutta University, said the university had donated Rs 10 lakh to the government fund to help in the fight against the virus. She said she had appealed to teachers and members of the non-teaching staff to donate whatever they felt like. “Responses received so far have been encouraging.”Calcutta Girls' High School contributed Rs 5 lakh to the chief minister’s relief fund on Tuesday.Principal Basanti Biswas had requested staff members on WhatsApp. “Pictures of migrant workers trying to get back home, walking  for miles are very disturbing. We are responsible citizens staying at home and maintaining social distance…. Thousands, stranded at bus stops and train stations, without food and shelter, makes  me feel guilty and uncomfortable,” Biswas wrote on WhatsApp.The nation is facing a calamity unheard of and unseen in recent times. “We can all do our bit by standing with our nation at this moment of national disaster,” she wrote.",2020-03-31 20:52:00
190,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Switched off: phones of some international fliers - Telegraph India,"Around 11,000 international passengers have arrived in the city between March 9 and March 26, and tracking a number of them has turned out to be impossible, sources in the state government said on Tuesday.The state health department and various municipal corporations and municipalities have remained in touch with a majority of them over the phone, seeking details about their health and trying to find out whether they have developed any symptom of Covid-19. But many others have remained unreachable.An official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said: “There are some non-Indian passengers who we could not contact because their phone numbers provided by the airlines are switched off. It seems they have taken new SIM cards after arriving in India. We don’t know where and how they are. We do not even know whether they have returned to their countries.”The tracking involves calling up the passengers every day and asking whether they are running a temperature or facing any respiratory problems, and also whether they have quarantined themselves for the mandatory 14-day period.“There is no way to cross-check. We have to believe what the people are saying. But it could well be that some of them have jumped the quarantine and left,” said an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.The civic body is in charge of keeping track of the people who have arrived in the city from abroad and find out whether they have developed any symptoms of coronavirus infection.While arrival of international flights in India was stopped on March 22, ships have arrived at the Calcutta port between March 24 and March 26, the government sources said.“The state health department has prepared a list of passengers who arrived at the Calcutta airport between March 9 and 22, and a few people who arrived by ship between March 24 and 26. Together, the figure stands at 11,000-odd,” said a state government official. “The ships had only crew members.”Till the middle of March, there were restrictions on arrival of passengers from only a few countries. Entry of passengers “from member countries of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and United Kingdom to India” was “prohibited with effect from March 18”.An advisory published on March 16 said “no airline shall board a passenger from these nations to India with effect from 1200 GMT on 18th March, 2020”.Entry of passengers from Afghanistan, the Philippines and Malaysia, too, was temporarily banned.There was, however, no bar on travellers from many countries that were affected by Covid-19, such as the US.Officials of the Bengal government said tracking of international passengers by the state health department started way back in the last week of January. An official said the first three people from Kerala to test positive for Covid-19 had returned home from China’s Wuhan province, where the Covid-19 pandemic had started, in the last week of January.“They had returned on the same flight via Calcutta. Some of the co-passengers of the three were Calcuttans and the state health department had to track them down and asked them to stay in home quarantine,” said a health department official.“We tracked down four or five passengers from Calcutta and Bengal. One of them was from Ramgarh, near Garia, and another from Naihati in North 24-Parganas,” the official said.But tracking became very irregular over the next month and a half. “Many passengers arrived then and we have not even tried to track them,” said an official.Tracking international passengers arriving at Dum Dum airport became strict again from around the middle of March.Public health experts fear many of the international passengers would spread the virus to people who came in contact with them. “They may be asymptomatic now but they can develop symptoms after a few days,” an expert said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had expressed her displeasure at the alleged delay by the Union government in preventing international flights from landing in the country. During a video conference between the Prime Minister and the chief ministers of all states earlier in March, Mamata had raised the point and asked Narendra Modi to stop international flight arrivals in the country.",2020-03-31 20:53:00
192,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Calcutta trader helps teen with cancer - Telegraph India,"A Howrah businessman responded to a call to donate platelets to a 13-year-old boy fighting leukaemia who started bleeding from the nose because of low platelet count.The Jharkhand boy is undergoing treatment at Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre and Research Institute in Thakurpukur with his mother by his side. Other members of his family have not been able to travel to the city because of the lockdown. “I hope the boy recovers soon and is able to go home. I was at home because of the lockdown and I travelled just a few kilometres to give the platelets,” Prabhu Shaw, 35, said.Shaw reached Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, where arrangements had been made for the donation, by car. “I got to know about the need for platelets from a volunteer, Hemant Vishwakarma, who alerted me in the afternoon about the boy’s need. I rushed as I was told the hospital’s blood bank might close for the day. It was important to give him the platelets today, I was told,” Shaw said.He was screened at the hospital before the donation. The entire process took a couple of hours. “I have donated blood on several occasions but this is the first time I donated platelets. I have been screened in the past but patients got other donors. This time I hope it is of use and the boy’s condition improves,” Shaw who lives with his parents, wife and children said. “The single-donor platelet is taken from a single donor through a machine. It is equivalent to eight to 10 extracts from as many donors. Since the process takes more than an hour and uses a machine ,people are generally reluctant,” Arnab Gupta, director of the cancer hospital at Thakurpukur, said.There has been a shortage of blood at blood banks, including the one in the Thakurpukur hospital, he said. “I had called up at least 10 blood banks in the city but there is an acute shortage. People are reluctant to come out and donate blood. My request is that those who are fit and have no recent history of travel or contact should donate blood,” Gupta said.A social media post by the hospital director alerted a group of individuals who work with Project for Life, which is involved in resolving the shortage of blood. “We try to facilitate the process so that a person doesn’t have to travel,” Varun Singh of Narayana Superspeciality Hospital said.At the cancer hospital in Thakurpukur, a nurse, Moumita Dey, and a blood bank staff at the hospital, Kalyan Das, donated platelets for two patients. Dey gave it for a patient she had been nursing and Das to a three-year-old girl whose grandmother stands every day outside the blood bank, asking for platelets.",2020-03-31 20:55:00
193,Subhankar Chowdhury,Jadavpur University’s community radio goes digital - Telegraph India,"Radio JU 90.8, Jadavpur University’s community radio, is back on air through digital platforms.The station at 90.8MHz was set up as part of the JU Project, TEQIP (Technical Education and Quality Improvement programme), in collaboration with school of media communication and culture in 2008.It has been operational all these years to promote community interaction and dissemination of information and has provided students, teachers, and people of the area with a platform to to showcase their creativity.Radio JU, which operates from the top floor of a building adjacent to Gate No. 4, had last aired a show on March 17, after which the institution had closed because of the lockdown to prevent the possible spread of the novel coronavirus.The station started airing programmes on YouTube on Tuesday on ways to reach those in distress because of the lockdown and observing the safety protocol to fight the virus. Programmes are being aired on Facebook, too, Iman Kalyan Lahiri, the convener of JU Radio, told Metro.One can forward his/her queries, complaints or content to https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljoKfKwxRdqiezp-Os9dkA/videos and Facebook page Radio JU Fight Against COVID 19, Lahiri, who is a teacher at the university’s international relations department said.One can send queries to covid19radioju@gmail.com as well, Lahiri said. The programmes include interviews of students facing problems in the absence of classes and professors offering guidance apart from an on-call platform by doctors. There’s a programme highlighting how JU students started a community kitchen to feed footpath dwellers in south Calcutta.Metro on Monday had reported about the community kitchen initiative by JU students and research scholars.A university official attached with the station said several JU students from South 24-Parganas and Bankura have posted contents seeking help for villagers during the lockdown.A student from South 24-Parganas posted a message saying many villagers who had stayed put in their homes in the initial days of the lockdown had started going back to the fields because they had run out of resources. The student requested people to contribute “generously”.On the Facebook page, Angira Mukherjee, a former student now living in London, on Monday had requested people to maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus.On the digital platforms, RJs are hosting programmes on mental health and well-being. Life in quarantine can get very difficult at times and the world can become a scary place. Anyone in need of professional help will be put in touch with a psychiatrist or counsellor, a university official said.Metro had reported last week about a group of Calcuttans starting a community radio station to bring back social solidarity in times of the lockdown.",2020-03-31 20:59:00
195,Debraj Mitra,Hunting festival in Bengal in lockdown time - Telegraph India,"Scores of men allegedly assembled in a West Midnapore forest on Sunday morning for a hunting festival held every summer.The men, armed with bows and arrows, spears, spades and bamboo poles attached with iron spikes, are said to have gathered outside Enayetpur forest in Gurguripal, not far from the spot where the Lalgarh tiger was killed by a similar hunting party in 2018. The festival sees indiscriminate killing of wild animals.“Our local volunteers said at least 100 men had assembled. They went into the forest and some were deputed to ensure that nobody else is allowed to track or film them,” said a volunteer of the Human and Environment Alliance League (HEAL), who lives in West Midnapore.The forests straddling the borders of West Midnapore, Jhargram and Bankura are home to a variety of wildlife — jungle cats, wild boars, monitor lizards and several species of birds.Some residents said they spotted dead birds and animals but this newspaper could not access any such picture or corroborate the claim.The pictures available with Metro show a group of men with spears roaming the forest. The gathering, if true, makes a mockery of the ongoing nationwide lockdown enforced to tackle the novel coronavirus outbreak.When The Telegraph sent the pictures to a senior police officer of West Midnapore, he said: “There is no mass hunting information in my district as of now. We will look into it closely.”Called after an hour, he said the crowd had been dispersed.Hearing a PIL filed by HEAL, Calcutta High Court had in April 2019 prohibited hunting wildlife in the garb of rituals in various districts of south Bengal. The court had also directed the wildlife authorities to work in collaboration with the district administration and the police to ensure that hunting festivals were not held.Meghna Banerjee of HEAL said the hunting party violated the high court order and also threatened to create a public health emergency. “At a time when any kind of gathering can create a public health emergency, hundreds of hunters are on the prowl. The district magistrate and the police are looking the other way.  They should immediately enforce a curfew and arrest the hunters,” she said.A senior forest official in Calcutta said the gathering at Gurguripal was of “around 50 men”. “It is not possible for us to patrol every corner. The forest they gathered in is not a regular hunting hotspot. But as soon as we received information, we sent a team and the men were driven out,” he said. “The men who were driven out did not have any kill on them. If we find any carcasses in the forest, we will take action accordingly.”",2020-03-31 21:01:00

198,Brinda Sarkar,Salt Lake woman quarantined away from city - Telegraph India,"Ketaki Bagchi of New Town’s BA Block has been in quarantine in Delhi for a week now. She does not have the dreaded virus but the government is taking no chances as she is just back from the Middle East. Bagchi, who retired as head of the ophthalmology department of Calcutta National Medical College, shares her experience —My daughter is pursuing research in Israel and I had gone to visit her in early March. But the Covid-19 count rose so fast and high that I felt it prudent to return home. The Indian government declared March 22 as the last day it would allow international flights to land and my flight landed in Delhi airport at 7.30am March 22.The airport was crowded like nobody’s business. People rushed about, shouted and no one maintained the meter-long distance. I pointed this out to the security guards at my immigration queue but they didn’t take it seriously.My connecting flight to Calcutta was at 4.15pm and after immigration I was asked to get going. Suddenly the officers stopped me and called me back. They said I would be screened and that I should claim my baggage first. The baggage section was teeming with people, all fresh off the boat. At the screening I thought we would be tested but were just interviewed. “How old are you? Do you have any symptoms?” That was the gist of it. Since I’m 67 years old, they decided to quarantine me. I argued that I neither have symptoms nor was I coming from a high-risk country. Moreover I’m a doctor so I would know! But all my protests were met by the same answer: “We are only following orders.”The system was neither scientific nor fool-proof. I don’t know how they screened the youth and how far the youths went on to observe self-quarantine. As a rule the youth are more disobedient. It’s the elderly who are less mobile and so more comfortable staying home.Life in solitudeThey gave us two choices to stay during the 14-day quarantine period — a free-of-cost government accommodation or a private hotel for which we would be charged Rs 3,500 a day plus meals. I went for the former.Outside the airport were tens of buses dispersing quarantine patients like me. I hopped into one and found a man, in his 40s, sitting next to me. I asked him why he was on the bus and he said he had a cough a week ago. I looked away without another word. I didn’t even ask him where he had come from.The journey was an ordeal. The bus would drive into a private hotel, some passengers would step out but soon return when they learnt the rooms were full. This went on for so long that I dozed off. When I woke up we were still hotel-hopping. I lost it and screamed at the authorities. It was nearly midnight and we were exhausted! Think of the diabetics on the bus who hadn’t eaten all day.I finally checked into a dharmashala at 11pm. Thank God they could give us a meal to eat at that hour.I am now living my days in solitude. There are some few issues with the food and service but I have no choice. My room has no TV or WiFi so I’m using my mobile data sparingly. My son is topping-up my mobile balance from Bangalore. There is a balcony attached to my room and I look out to see everything deserted outside. Once in a while I see a fellow quarantined guest of another room and we exchange pleasantries. But I have my laptop and am spending time writing.I am, however, worried about my husband Santi Ranjan Bagchi, who is home alone in New Town. He’s 71.Looking aheadMy quarantine period will end on April 4, after which I will be tested. But even if the results are negative, I’m not sure how I would return to Calcutta as the lockdown is underway.Come to think of it, being home — or in my case dharmashala-bound is not so bad. Make the most of it. Don’t we complain the rest of the year that we don’t have time to pursue our hobbies? Plus, unlike me, others have unlimited internet.",2020-04-04 12:52:00

A water bowser from the civic body also sprayed water mixed with disinfectants on the road in front of the businessman’s house. A team also cleaned up and sanitised the AD block community centre that is right opposite the house.“The house is located near the park and the community centre. We are focussing on sanitising the immediate vicinity of the house and will later finish the other parts of the block,” said Chatterjee.According to an official of the civic body’s health department, the residents have told them that they had spotted the domestic helps of the family and even the man’s brother, son and driver at BD Market on multiple occasions after he was hospitalised.The civic body is trying to draw up a list of contacts with whom the businessman and his family members might have come in contact.This has become the talking point in the block. Voicing the mood of the neighbourhood, Saptarshi Bhattacharya, 28, who stays a stone’s throw away from the businessman’s house, said they were living in fear.“This is getting really scary. The contagion has reached our doorstep. I have an ailing mother and we have decided not to step out unless absolutely necessary,” said Bhattacharya.Kajori Roy, whose 98-year-old uncle Manomohan Roy stays in a two-storeyed house adjacent to the businessman’s, said that she was “extremely worried” for her uncle, a retired government doctor. “He stays alone and has an attendant to care of him. We are extremely worried for him as his next-door neighbour has tested positive for novel coronavirus,” said Roy, an IT firm employee.On Wednesday, she drove down from her New Town house to drop supplies like eggs, medicines and vegetables to her uncle’s house.“I ensured that I cleaned my hand with disinfectant and had a mask on before stepping out of my car. I also dropped the supplies on the doorstep and asked the caretaker to maintain distance while picking them up,” said Kajori, who stays in New Town’s Sanjeeva Town Duplex.A team of health department officials of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation had rushed to the AD Block house where the patient lived. His 23-year-old son, driver and the family’s full-time domestic help have been sent to the quarantine unit in New Town. His daughter, who suffers from breathing trouble, and his wife are in home quarantine. His brother’s family members, who stay on another floor of the building, have been asked to remain in isolation at home. Two more part-time domestic helps and a technician from a diagnostic centre, who used to visit the house periodically, have been instructed to remain in home quarantine for 14 days.It was later learnt that the man admitted at AMRI Salt Lake had hosted a visitor from the US at home on March 17. He had also attended a party on March 19, where the visitor was present.",2020-04-04 12:52:00
200,A Staff Reporter,Bidhannagar Horticultural Society co-founder passes away - Telegraph India,"Sudarshan Kumar Maiti, patron of Bidhannagar Horticultural Society and gardening columnist of The Telegraph Salt Lake passed away on March 31. He had been hospitalised for a week at a Kankurgachhi nursing home for pulmonary problems. Maiti was 85 years old and is survived by his wife and daughter. A resident of FC Block, Maiti was a civil engineer with a green thumb. He spent the final years of his service on “Salt Lake Project” on behalf of the government since 1977 and was entrusted with the work of tree plantation in avenues, parks and gardens.Maiti was one of the founders of the Bidhannagar Horticultural Society, that celebrated its silver jubilee last year. “Maitida was the pillar of our society. He had in depth knowledge of plants and was always ready to help us,” said Arijit Poddar, secretary of the society. For The Telegraph Salt Lake, he had been a columnist since 2005, having shared tips on growing different kinds of plants in our gardens. He was currently writing a series on cacti. ",2020-04-04 12:52:00
201,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus lockdown: Police reach pay of domestic help in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Police officials belonging to the New Town Technocity police station are earning kudos for a courier job they have undertaken. They are picking up salaries of the domestic help working in some of the housing complexes in the township and delivering them to their homes in neighbourhood colonies or villages where they are confined because of the lockdown. It all started with the women of DLF New Town Heights wondering how to reach the month’s salaries to the domestic help as March drew to a close. “Once the lockdown was announced we asked them not to report for work any more. We too stopped allowing outsiders in. So we stopped meeting them,” recalled Nabakumar Mondal, vice-president of DLF New Town Heights Owners’ Association. At first, it was mooted that the money would be remitted to their bank accounts. “But it struck us that with public transport off the streets they could not make it to the bank.”Anasua Sarkar, who had initiated the discussion, pointed out that the husbands of the women were mostly daily labourers who were rendered jobless by the lockdown. “They urgently needed the cash,” she said. So the local police station was contacted to seek permission for the women to come on pay day.Inspector in charge of the Technocity police station Partha Sikdar came up with another idea. “I was worried that once it was time to get their salaries, they would defy the lockdown to gather at the gate of the complex. Being refused entry could lead to unrest. So I proposed that we collect the salaries in sealed envelopes from the complex and hand it over to them at home,” said Sikdar.Six women received their salaries thus on March 28. “Another 10 working at New Town Heights will get theirs on Thursday,” Sarkar said. News of the initiative has reached other complexes. “We have been contacted by Shapoorji Pallonji and Rosedale to help them pay their domestic staff. The next lot of payments will be done on Thursday,” Sikdar said on Wednesday.“It is amazing that the police took this on. We too will seek their help with reaching the salaries if the lockdown gets extended,” said Debjani Gupta of Tata Eden Court.",2020-04-04 12:52:00
203,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus lockdown: NKDA extends property tax date - Telegraph India,"In view of the outbreak of Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed to contain it from March 23, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has extended the last date for self-assessment and payment of property taxes to June 30.

205,Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus lockdown ruins plans of rituals in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Festivals and pujas are being downscaled or even skipped in the backdrop of Covid-19. In the past few days Annapurna puja, Navratri and Nava Varsh were all marked on the religious calendar but residents could hardly celebrate them. Mayor Krishna Chakraborty had to make do by offering Annapurna puja to the ghot in her CJ Block home. “This was to have been the 11th edition of my puja through which I am continuing a century-old tradition in my mother-in-law’s family,” she said.  In fact, she took recourse to technology in doing so. “Since I could get neither priest nor an idol, I requested Swagatalaksmi (Dasgupta, the singer) to send me some appropriate slokas via WhatsApp messages. My daughter played dhak and kanshor recordings on her phone on YouTube,” the mayor said.But she ensured that puja also take place by asking a panda from Kalighat temple familiar to her to offer puja at an Annapurna temple on the bank of the Adiganga. “I prayed to Ma to grant the world respite from this terrible infection,” she said.Another priest could not reach Rahul Arora’s house in AD Block for Navratri either. “But he promised to do Chandi path on our behalf at home. My grandpa from Bhawanipore guided us on other rituals over video call and taught us the bhajans to sing. There were no belpata or garlands of 108 hibiscuses in the market this year so we plucked them from our terrace instead,” said Arora, who could also not get sabu and yoghurt that he usually eats during the nine-day fast for Navratri. He had to make do with boiled potatoes and fruits this year.Perhaps the most upset are residents of BC Block who had to cancel their Annapurna puja altogether. “It would have been the first community Annapurna puja in our block. More than 30 families had pooled in and raised funds. “We had even paid Rs 2,000 in advance to a Kumartuli sculptor for the idol. The money is non-refundable,” said the organising members.AK Block’s Aritra Ranjan Sen, who had scaled up the Annapurna puja in his house since last year, spent the last four months planning this year. “Invitations had been sent out. I had paid Rs 23,000 to the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company for 35KW extra electricity, Rs 2,500 to the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation for a water tanker, placed an order for an idol with a Kumartuli artisan and even bought a Benarasi sari for the idol to be wrapped in. All that came to nought,” said Sen. “I could salvage only the contractor's bill as the pandal was supposed to have been erected four days before the puja.”But Sen did not cancel the puja altogether. He offered it to the ghot of Goddess Lakshmi in his thakur ghor. “Thankfully our thakurmoshai could cycle to our place from Action Area 1 in New Town.” His neighbours who had planned to host pujas at their homes could not make such arrangements. “They sent offerings to our puja instead,” Sen said.But regret messages had to be sent to guests cancelling the invitation. The puja was held on Wednesday with barely 10 people present.For Navratri, Renu Verma, of CL Block, says it is a custom to invite children up to the age of six for meals and gift them money. “This time we had to wish them over phone and send them money through online money transfer,” said Verma.On Ram Navami (that was on April 2 this year), her family starts new books, like the haal khata system that Bengali businessmen follow. “This year there are no shops open to sell these so we'll be performing a symbolical puja on one of my grandchildren’s notebooks. Once offices reopen we’ll keep the book there. Of course, we’ll be offering special prayers for the health of the world amidst the coronavirus crisis,” Verma said on Wednesday.Arora’s family performs kumari puja on Ram Navami by worshipping nine girls and one boy. “We do it with children of our domestic helps, sweepers and the like. Since this year none of that will happen we’re roping in our garbage collector, who has a daughter,” said Arora on Wednesday. “We shall gift him nine envelopes of token money and goody bags in lieu of nine children.”If residents missed hosting the Mother Goddess in a grand way, Kumartuli was left counting its losses after orders were cancelled en masse. “In the 22 years that I have been in this profession, this is the biggest loss I have suffered. Of the 27 orders I had for Annapurna idols, 25 were cancelled outright. Two organisers were ready to accept their idols if I could arrange to reach it to them. But I could not risk being caught by the police during lockdown. So I backed out,” lamented China Pal, the most well-known woman artisan in Kumartuli.“The idols are all ready but for a coat of paint. I have paid labourers for a month and half to produce those. With Durga puja coming up next, I don't even have space in my studio to preserve them.” Unlike in Durga idols, Annapurna has Shiva and Nandi the bull right next to her. This makes it difficult to transform unsold Annapurna idols to Durga, she explained.",2020-04-04 12:53:00
206,Our Special Correspondent,NKDA starts coronavirus video call - Telegraph India,"With people stuck at home because of the lockdown, NKDA has arranged for counselling over video call to respond to Covid-19 queries from New Town residents. The telemedicine facility will be available from Monday to Friday, 1 pm to 3.30pm, with a half-hour break from 2pm. The Skype name for the call is NKDA Health Centre. “NKDA has two medical officers who run our health centre. Earlier, we had started a WhatsApp service for them to address queries related to infection symptoms. It did not work out. From Wednesday, we have started a video call service instead,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen.",2020-04-04 12:53:00
207,Brinda Sarkar,Teachers and students connect online as novel coronavirus infection scare shuts down educational institutes - Telegraph India,"The class must go on. Schools and institutes may be locked down to stop the spread of coronavirus but the indomitable spirit of teachers and students has ensured that education does not stop. From schools and tuitions to yoga and singing sessions — the classroom has shifted online. How it’s done Arpita Roy sits before her harmonium, switches on the Google Duo app on her phone, sees her students online and leads them on song. The founder of CE Block’s Sangeetalaya music school couldn’t imagine life without music so she learnt the technology from her son to keep the classes alive. Rakhi Nundy, a Bengali teacher of AA Block, is also teaching batches over the internet. “There’s no other way. Even the Prime Minister doesn’t know if the lockdown will end after 21 days but life has to go on. The syllabus will not finish if students become complacent now,” say the lady who is using Skype and Google Duo. “Students are sending me their homework by email or WhatsApp, I’m correcting them and sending them back.” Jayeeta Chanda, who teaches at B.P. Poddar Institute of Management and Technology, says they moved online the very day after the government called for a shut down. “It was possible as the college had an existing online platform. Teachers started sharing study material there, uploading YouTube videos and students were to go through them and come to us to clear doubts. A class that would take me an hour is now taking three hours with preparation but at least students are not suffering,” says the resident of New Town’s Sunrise Point. Suvadeep Chakraborty, founder of the elocution class Shrutibritto in HB Block, will start online classes from next week. “People are so depressed at the moment that a music or recitation class will only ease their tension. I shall take batches of four to five students, teach them at once but ask them to recite individually,” he says. Better than beforeSome classes are going great guns. Rajyam Gupta, founder of Yoga Plus says they only have space for 30 students at their centres in BF Block, Kankurgachi and Bangur Avenue. “But my Facebook Live sessions every morning are garnering thousands of views. Students are tuning in from around the world,” says the teacher who has decided to keep the classes free of cost during the lockdown. To cater to the different levels of students, he is teaching basic asanas and specifying the dos and don’ts before the difficult ones. Students of spirituality are logging in too. “Our institute has always had e-learning courses so this is something we encourage,” says Subhasis Chakrabarti, who conducts classes for Vedanta Institute Kolkata at AMP Vaisaakkhi mall.Their first few classes were on tackling the lockdown and Covid-19 scare using knowledge from scriptures like the Bhagwad Gita and even students who have now shifted to different cities signed in for solace. “We are finding online classes useful and even after the lockdown ends would like to continue them for those living out of town,” says Chakrabarti.Puloma Sen of Nrityam dance institute in DA Block cannot recall a time all her students were available whenever she called a class. “Everyone is free now and getting bored. They are jumping at the prospect of a dance class and attendance is higher than ever before,” smiles Sen. “Online classes are not ideal but something is better than nothing. At least students are staying in touch with the art.”Shirin Anwar, one of the students of Nrityam is delighted she’s getting to dance during the lockdown. “I was appearing for my Class XII CBSE exams when the lockdown got issued. I still have two papers left and am frustrated studying for them,” says the resident of Falguni Abasan. “But thanks to online classes I’m dancing after four or five months. Plus I’m relieved at being able to see some familiar faces despite not stepping out.”The challenges Online classes are not without their share of challenges. Perhaps it is toughest for schools, that have to juggle multiple subjects and thousands of students. “It’s a new system and we experimenting to see what works,” says Ajay Chopra, administrator of St Francis Xavier school in Purbachal. “We started online classes on April 1 for Class X and XII. We are using the Zoom app and offering three subjects a day. After a week we’ll have a review meeting with teachers to find out the best teaching methods.” Before class, teachers are conducting an orientation session to teach online classroom etiquette. “Students are to keep their mute button on so others are not disturbed by noises from their end. They must also avoid any movement in their background else the visual would distract others,” explains Chopra. While humanities subjects might still be taught over an online lecture, a math teacher from Salt Lake’ Sector I wonders how he is to explain the steps of sums. “I’ve found some hardware online that allows a teacher to write on a mousepad-like device through which his writings get transferred to the screen. But with everything locked down, where am I to buy this?” he asks. The teacher, who asked not to be named, is also a guest faculty at a Sector V college. “Full-time faculty there have been asked to take Zoom sessions but not everyone has WiFi at home and it is consuming way too much data,” he reasons. Roy of Sangeetalaya complains of internet issues too. “A group can begin singing together but if one has a slow connection, there is a delay in voice transmission and the whole choir goes out of tune. Also, the audio and visual do not get transmitted together sometimes so I’m asking students not to lip-read my song but only to listen to them.” Those like Nundy, the Bengali teacher, have decided to settle for online payment of fees during the lockdown. Those like Roy haven’t thought of fees yet. “I’m most upset at having to postpone our annual day that was scheduled for April. We had been rehearsing since after the Pujas and were absolutely ready to perform. It’s no use planning an online show as there’s no ambience without a live audience,” she says. Attention spanJhumur Mandal, an English teacher of AE Block, is yet to go online. “Eventually I may have to but will the classes be as effective? My cousin, who is a professor at an IIT, says half his students are not responding to online classes so what can I expect from middle school students?” she wonders.Dipika Ghatak, a student of nutrition at NSHM Knowledge Campus, is satisfied with the Zoom classes she is attending. But she also runs an art school Spectrum and tried to conduct online classes for her students, unsuccessfully. “Most of my students are five and six-year-olds who found Zoom classes too serious. They walked off,” says the resident of New Town’s CD Block. Ghatak has now asked the kids to draw the theme “coronavirus” and send her their art over WhatsAap for her to check and send tips. Priyanka Niyogi who teaches classes II and III in DPS Megacity, is preparing for online classes soon. But more than technology she’s worried about attention span. “Young children are tough enough to manage in class. Online, it will be even tougher. I will need co-operation from parents. Maybe parents can sit with the students and ensure they pay attention,” says the resident of DB Block.",2020-04-04 12:53:00
208,Manasi Shah,"As one of a handful of Baghdadi Jews living in Calcutta and perhaps the oldest of the lot, Flower's story is not her story alone  - Telegraph India","She is called Flower but there is nothing seemingly fragile about the 90-year-old woman. She is tall with broad shoulders. Her skin is smooth and barely lined. “I have seen a lot of history — 70 years of that century and 20 years of this,” smiles Flower Silliman, one of the 30 Baghdadi Jews still living in Calcutta. We are at Flower’s residence on Moira Street and though it is just her and me in the room, the many Frida Kahlo portraits on the walls, on the sideboard, form our greater audience. She is in an easy chair, resplendent in a green floral nightgown. The sun is peeping through the netted windows of her living room and lighting up the red-oxide floor. Her green-gold eyes twinkle with memories and she adds in clipped English, “I have five children, 13 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.”Flower’s parents were born in Calcutta; it was her grandparents — both sets — who came from different parts of Iraq. The paternal grandparents arrived in Calcutta from Basra. Her grandfather, a petty trader, would bring fezzes — short cylindrical peakless caps, sometimes with a tassel attached — from Baghdad and sell them all over the Far East and return home with spices. Says Flower, “All Muslims would wear fez caps then. In India, my grandfather would stop in Bombay and Calcutta. Otherwise he went to Penang, Jakarta, Singapore.” Flower’s grandfather got married when he was 50. Flower dwells awhile on his fabled good looks — six-foot tall, blue eyes and so on — but it is his 16-year-old wife, Flower’s grandmother, who seems to have made a more enduring impression on her. In fact, Flower refracts her own story and the story of her entire family as it were, through the personas of her two grandmothers. The descriptions, the attention to detail, the emotions attached are so overwhelming that by the time the interview is over and I have taken my leave of her, I realise that I don’t even know the names of the two grandfathers.Flower says, “My grandmother’s name was Farah. Farah is joy in Arabic. My name is Farah too. But I was born in the heydays of the Raj, which is why everything had to be anglicised. I became Flower. My two brothers had Arabic names but they were called Charles and Eric.”Flower cannot stop talking about Farah. Farah lived a colourful life. Farah travelled to the Far East. In the Far East, Farah moved from one Jewish home to another with her husband. Farah had a beautiful Chinese shawl embroidered with red roses. Farah and her husband smoked the hookah. Flower is so into the Farah-tales that it would be rude to turn focus back on her own life. Says Flower, “My father was born in Singapore in 1899 and my aunt in Penang. This is all in a diary and I have it with me. It is written in Hebrew...” As the story goes, Farah and her husband decided to settle down once the children reached school-going age and the city of their choice was Calcutta, where Baghdadi Jews were very many in number and mostly into indigo or opium trade.Flower’s maternal side had their roots in Al Uzair. On that side of her family, until a couple of generations ago, most of the men were trained to be mohels, or priests. “Mohels are people who perform circumcision and other special religious duties. They were trained and sent out to places where the clergy was needed to read the prayers or maintain the synagogues,” says Flower.Her maternal grandmother’s name is Simha. Most of Simha’s brothers went to Shanghai and one of them went to Poona [now Pune] to work as a steward in the home of Jewish businesswoman, scholar and philanthropist, Flora Sassoon. When Flora fell ill and someone was needed to nurse her, Simha was asked over. Says Flower, “When she died, she left some money for Simha to get married and that is how she and her brother arrived in Calcutta, where she got married soon after.” Flower recollects how Simha would sew clothes and women’s garments. She says, “My mother experienced poverty. But Jews never had to beg. We looked after our poor.” The Jewish Girls’ School in Calcutta was set up by the Jews and everything from education to clothes to food was provided free of cost. Flower’s mother, Miriam Shooker, was among the first batch of students and she eventually went on to become a nursery school teacher.In the early 20th century, there were around 5,000 Jews in the city. Everyone lived in close proximity to each other with the majority settled near Maghen David Synagogue in Burrabazar. The Jewish para extended to Bentinck Street, Grants Lane, Bowbazar, Phears Lane, Chaatawali Galli, Marquis Street, Kyd Street, Sudder Street and Middleton Row. Everyone in the community knew each other, and frequented the same synagogues and clubs. The Judean Club in central Calcutta was a world unto itself. In her time, Flower and her friends would play badminton and housie here, dance and listen to music. Flower mixes her reminiscing with footnotes — Yom Kippur is the day of atonement; Hanukkah is the festival of lights, much like Diwali; traditionally Jews never mix meat and milk; Bar Mitzvah is like the thread ceremony and so on and so forth.Flower’s parents, Miriam and Elias Abraham, married in 1920. Elias worked at the Calcutta port as a measurer of jute and gunny. Flower was born on April 20, 1930, at the Eden hospital — now part of the Calcutta Medical College. She says, “It was a British hospital and in those days it was the hospital of choice for Jews, Christians and Anglo-Indians.” By that time, both her grandfathers had passed away.And then World War II broke out. Says Flower, “Jewish refugees came into our lives because they were relatives of someone or the other. When the Japanese entered Burma [now Myanmar], the Jews there had to leave. Some came here by ship. Some trekked via Chittagong and Assam to Calcutta. And many of them died on the way. A lot of these displaced people came to live with us. They had nothing. They slept on the sofas, on the floors, and they remained with us till they got a job.”Flower looks out of the window, possibly remembering what her nine-year-old self had witnessed. As the Japanese came closer, they bombed the docks and Kidderpore. There was no casualty but it did scare the life out of people. Flower, along with her brother and mother, was sent away. The little girl found herself in Delhi for a few months, far from the comforts of home and fond things such as baklavas and Turkish Delights and cheese samosas.At 13, Flower was sent away again — this time as a boarder to a school in Nagpur. This was where she first got a taste of a non-Jewish environment. She says, “From having only Jewish friends, now I had no Jewish friends, only Anglo-Indian and Christian ones. I was the only Jewish girl. I started to eat non-kosher food. I started going to church with my Christian friends.”Her next stop was Delhi, where she joined Lady Irwin College — the director, Hannah Sen, was a Jew from Calcutta. Almost everyone around her now was a Hindu or a Muslim. Soon Flower found herself celebrating Guru Nanak Jayanti, Holi, Diwali. She says, “It felt like I had lived in a cocoon and now suddenly I was a butterfly. I loved Frank Sinatra and I had taken records with me. I told my friend Sheila to play them. She made a deal with me. If I listened to Pankaj Mullick, she would listen to Sinatra.”After graduation, Flower returned to Calcutta and started teaching at St. Thomas’ School, Kidderpore. At 21, she married a Jewish man whom she had met at the Judean Club. He came from a family of foreign exchange brokers and was also the direct descendant of Shalom Aharon Obadiah Cohen — the first recorded Jewish immigrant who arrived in Calcutta in 1798. Says Flower, “Calcutta had changed completely. Suddenly the streets were full of people in khaki. We had never seen planes before and now there were planes on Red Road. Calcutta was a big war base. In 1939, the British army arrived and by 1942, there were American soldiers too. Many of them came to our houses for festivals and Friday night dinners. They got to know the families and started dating their daughters. Many fell in love with these soldiers — some of whom were Jews — and once the war was over most left. The exodus started.”And then came a time when entire families started migrating. In May 1948, Israel was officially declared an independent state and many Jews shifted from Bombay and Calcutta. The Israeli government even airlifted people. In the meantime, a newly independent India was rife with a variety of rumours. Flower says, “There were rumours that Hindi would become the national language, everything would become Indianised. Jews felt they would not do so well in an independent India and were frightened. Jewish business firms such as the National Tobacco Company and the jute mills at Agarpara were sold out. People left. By 1955, we lost half the Jewish community.”Flower too left the city but later, in 1975. She moved to Israel, where she set up a restaurant of kosher Indian food which she called The Maharaja. “Every evening, I would wear a sari and go to the restaurant. People would call me Maharani,” she recalls with a laugh. She eventually moved to the US for a couple of years before returning to India for good in 2008. Mid-conversation, one of Flower’s neighbours enters the room. Flower asks her to check her computer’s Internet connection. The neighbour, a Mrs Ghosh, corrects Flower. She says, “It is not a computer, it is an iPad.” The nonagenarian replies, “Everything these days is a computer; even your phone is a computer. One of these days, we will be asked to swallow a tablet and we will all be computerised.”And I thought to myself — not you, Flower. Never you.",2020-04-04 18:37:00
209,Moumita Chaudhuri ,Coronavirus and the comprehensive closures it imposed have choked Calcutta’s arterial human and material supply line - Telegraph India,"In the days before the lockdown, the wholesale market in Canning would come alive at 3am. The traders would buy fish and vegetables in bulk, and make a dash for the adjacent train station. In pre-corona times, nearly 50 trains ran between Canning and Calcutta each day, ferrying several hundreds of men and women. Each had two dedicated vendor compartments packed with wicker baskets loaded with mocha and kumro shaak, cucumbers and cauliflowers, bananas and jackfruits as also men and women sitting cheek by jowl, hugging aluminium drums and large vessels filled to the brim with wriggling fish. The air inside a typical mix of fish and earth and sweat, and the floor of the compartment wet and muddy from the water spilt. Whenever a train pulled into Sealdah station or Ballygunge or Jadavpur, it was like a human outpouring. A giant workforce gushed into the city, filling up its veins and arteries and infusing them with lifeforce. Canning subdivision is a floret on the map of South 24-Parganas, a district in Bengal. The Canning line functions like a hyphen, linking a chunk of the rich hinterland with the state capital and prime market. It connects Canning town, Gosaba and other areas in the Sunderbans with Calcutta. From Canning to Sealdah station in Calcutta is a 57-kilometre long line connecting places such as Chandkhali, Taldi, Betberia Ghola, Ghutiari Sharif, Gourdaha Halt, Piali, Champahati, Kalikapur and Bidyadhari. All these dots meet at Sonarpur Junction, which further connects them to New Garia, Garia, Narendrapur, Baghajatin, Jadavpur, Dhakuria, Ballygunge Junction and Park Circus. Apart from Canning, Sonarpur Junction links two other crucial supply nodes, Lakshmikantapur/Namkhana and Diamond Harbour, to Calcutta at the demand end. At Ballygunge, more produce comes in from Budge Budge, a southwest suburb of Calcutta. The enhanced supply then reaches Calcutta’s largest wholesale market — the famed Koley Market in Sealdah. Enroute Sealdah, people get off at several junctions with their produce to feed the big and small local markets.The first stop is Sonarpur. The produce offloaded here feeds the Sonarpur Station Road market and is also transported via lorries and vans to the southeastern fringes of the city, namely Malancha and Ghatakpukur. Produce offloaded at Dhakuria feeds the Dhakuria Rail Bazar, Ballygunge Bazar and Gariahat Market. After a refill at Ballygunge, the rest of the produce, which is more than 50 per cent of the total volume of Canning’s produce, proceeds to Koley Market. And from there, further up north to Dum Dum and other arterial routes such as Hatibagan, Ultadanga and Maniktala Bazar.Calcutta has a daily demand of 550 tonnes of fish. Twenty per cent of this is from Canning alone. The percentage is higher when the entire South 24-Parganas is taken into consideration. Says Gourab Das, a wholesaler from Canning, “Until 2000, there was a dedicated fish train between Canning and Sealdah. Those days, fish used to come in from Kultali, Nyazak, Gosaba, Canning 1 & 2, Sarberia, Sandeshkhali, Jharkhali and other areas of the Sunderbans such as Maipith, Deolbari, Sonagaon, Saterkona, Mollakhali, Jibantala.” The lockdown has affected the supply.Shankar Das sells fish at Koley Market; he is a wholesaler. He gets part of his supply from Digha in East Midnapore, but a chunk of it comes from South 24-Parganas too. He says, “The freshwater fish used to come from Canning. I used to get over 250 kilos every day.” Since the lockdown he has shut shop. Goutam Mondal has a stall at the Ruby fish market; he gets about 20-25 kilos from Canning. He says, “Magur, koi, tilapia come from Canning.” It is also the crab hotspot. He adds, “There is no other place from where we can procure crab. It is caught in Basanti, Gosaba and in some more interior areas of the Sunderbans — Amlamethi, Raidighi and Namkhana — and brought to Calcutta and thereafter exported to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Europe.”Not only does the lockdown mean choked supply to Calcutta, it also means days of zero earning for at least 25-30 lakh fishermen living in and around the harbours of Midnapore and South 24-Parganas. Bablu Saha, who is a wholesaler at Canning Market, says there has been no fishing activity in Canning these last few days. Only a few fishermen are bringing whatever little they get in their own ponds — bhetki, rohu, catla, prawns.Bablu, who supplies fish to many fishsellers in Calcutta, informs that the arat or depot where he would conduct the auction is now under lock and key. “I am earning nothing these days — I cannot supply fish to Calcutta nor am I earning my daily commission from the arat,” he says.Taldi, Ghutiari Sharif, Champahati and Bidyadhari on the Canning line are important vegetable hubs. Together with Baruipur on the Diamond Harbour line and Raidighi and Joynagar on the Lakshmikantapur route, they pump in 30 per cent of the city’s vegetables. Says Tushar Ghosh, president of the West Bengal State Committee of the All India Agricultural Workers’ Union, “Canning contributes 12 to 13 per cent to Calcutta’s vegetable market.” With the lockdown, suppliers apparently have been reaching out to the city markets in lorries and vans taking the 10-kilometre long route. Some farmers are also leaving their homes in Champahati and Bidyadhari as early as three in the morning and cycling down 29 kilometres to Calcutta to bring their produce to markets such as Sonarpur, Garia and, of course, Koley Market.“It also works the other way round,” points out Shankar. After all, a lot of things are not produced there. “There are those who arrive by the same local train, buy from Koley Market and take it all back to the markets in Champahati, Canning and further down south,” he elaborates.The closure of the Canning line has impeded another critical input from the countryside, namely, labour. According to Ghosh, this line ferries around 50,000 people to Calcutta every day. He tells The Telegraph, “Of this, 35 to 40 per cent is employed in the unorganised sector.”Organised or unorganised, it is safe to say that in the absence of this army of help, several essential services are paralysed. Seventy per cent of this army comprises domestic help employed in residences in south Calcutta, from Baghajatin to Dhakuria. They are also employed as nurses, anganwadi workers, healthcare personnel, ayahs in schools, sweepers and cleaners in malls, as drivers, newspaper and milk delivery personnel, as beauticians in local parlours, masons and labourers at construction sites, as cleaners, electricians, security guards and so on.Sathi Poile leaves her house at five in the morning to take the train to Baghajatin. She works as a domestic help in two households and makesRs 8,000 a month. Others like Usha and Bithi work in four to five houses. They take the evening train home and earn over Rs 10,000 a month. The virus lockdown has come as a cruel surprise to Sathi and her ilk. She says, “Daily expenses have shot up. My employers would give me breakfast and lunch, my children would eat at school. With the lockdown, there is no supply of food grains in the local market. Even if you have the money, you won’t be able to buy what you need,” she adds.The absence of domestic help has affected the senior population most, especially those who live by themselves. It has also impacted households that engage nurses or attendants for an ailing family member or a young child. Sonali Nursing and Ayah Centre in Survey Park has been closed for some days. Says owner Juthika Mondal, “The ayahs take the local trains. They are not coming now.”Kinkor Mondal runs the Sushoma Driver Centre. Six out of 15 of his drivers are from Canning. Namita Dolui and her husband commute from Champahati. Namita is a housekeeping staff at the Metro Cash and Carry in Mukundapur, while her husband works at a construction site in Calcutta.According to Swapan Mondal, who has done his doctoral thesis on the land reclamation policies of the Sunderbans, with the Canning line closed daily wagers are haemorrhaging; the supply chain has been interrupted and there is possibly a loss of at least Rs 100-150 crore per day. He says, “Think of it this way. Our IT sector is running smoothly because of these people from the suburbs. Will you be able to go to work if your help does not come in to cook for you or look after your child? The supply chain comes a full circle only when you take into account this big picture. Nothing will run, nothing will move without them.”How Calcutta Eats Barring the East Kolkata Wetlands, the city gets its supply of fruits, vegetables and fish from suburban areas and certain adjoining districtsEast Kolkata WetlandsThe city gets 30 tonnes of freshwater fish and 150 tonnes of vegetables from here every day. The produce moves to arats in the North and South 24-Parganas and those in Calcutta too.

210,Surajit C. Mukhopadhyay,Burdwan varsity ex-VC passes on - Telegraph India,"Mohit Bhattacharya, academic and former vice-chancellor of Burdwan University, passed away following a cardiac arrest at his Salt Lake home on Friday. He was 88 and is survived by his wife, daughter and son.Bhattacharya, a leading name in the field of public administration, was suffering from multiple ailments for a long time.Surajit C. Mukhopadhyay, a professor of sociology at Amity University, Chhattisgarh, and a founder faculty of the department of sociology at the Burdwan University, pens a tribute to BhattacharyaIt is not easy writing about Professor Mohit Bhattacharya for the simple reason that many a memory come flooding to my mind. I was perhaps the junior most colleague of Mohit babu, as he was known at the University of Burdwan where he served as the Vice Chancellor from 1988-1996. In my long academic career I have never till date come across a more amiable, soft spoken person, whose style of administration was a lesson that we may all want to emulate. He never ever forgot that he was an academic first and his encouragement to faculty to excel themselves in research and classroom teaching was more by example than by orders.Born into a poor family in Gobardanga, Bengal, his journey to the portals of higher education was uncertain. Yet, he distinguished himself academically at Presidency College and then Calcutta University from where he earned his under-graduate and masters degree. He went to the University of Birmingham in the UK where he was awarded a PhD from the School of Public Policy.His books on public administration were highly appreciated by those interested in the subject and I am sure that countless bureaucrats in this country who appeared for their civil services examination read and learnt from his works. His former students would testify to his classroom craft, where his lectures and pedagogical style left no one in doubt that they were learning from a master. He is fondly remembered by his students at the University of Calcutta, where he was the Centenary Professor in the department of political science.Prof Bhattacharaya's expertise was not confined to the classroom only. His sage advice was much sought after from the government as well as those in the civil society. In his long and distinguished career, he wore many caps and adorned many a chair. Mohit babu was the Chairman of the Municipal Finance Commission, member of the West Bengal Police Commission, a National Fellow of the Indian Council for Social Science Research, member of the Indian Institute of Public Administration and an expert member of the Union Public Service Commission. Though never given to speaking much about his achievements in public his work and contribution was noticed and appreciated by fellow academics, bureaucrats and political leaders. Old hands in the bureaucratic circles remember former Bengal chief minister, Buddhadev Bhattacharya, often seeking Mohit babu's advice on matters ranging from higher education to public administration.Very few of his colleagues knew that he was a music aficionado. However, when he was among very close friends, he would regale them with his singing of Rabindrasangeet. He had a penchant for singing songs of Tagore that were rarely heard and his ability to recollect such songs was truly exceptional. He would often tell me that he missed having time to pursue reading novels and serious works of literature and that one should always read beyond the discipline of one's choice and expertise.He was very keen that the study of sociology as a subject takes roots in the state and he was instrumental in setting up the department of sociology at Burdwan University. To that end he took it upon himself to keep abreast of the troubles and travails that the new department was going through and we as junior faculty had access to his office for discussions. It was in one of such meetings that he told me that there was a thumb rule that he applied to understand the efficacy of a good teacher - one who leaves the class after it is over and yet the lecture lingers on in the minds of the students. Professor Bhattacharya lived by this precept - he left us on Friday after a cardiac arrest but what he told us in his life and works still lingers on.",2020-04-04 20:05:00
211,Our Special Correspondent,Lockdown violation count dips in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The number of vehicles on the roads and lockdown violators came down on Saturday compared with Friday.Police said 706 people were prosecuted for lockdown violation till 8pm on Saturday and 117 vehicles seized. The corresponding figures on Friday were 800 and 148, respectively.Police officers said they were flooded with requests to travel to other districts or commute within the city citing one excuse or another.“People are approaching police stations, dialling 100 or requesting over the phone to allow them to commute. All of them are claiming to be having some kind of emergency,” said an officer at Lalbazar.Some callers said they were stranded in the city for around two weeks and wanted to reunite with their families in districts. Some requested that they be allowed to meet their elderly parents, who live separately. A few wanted passes for their help so they could commute daily without being questioned by cops.“We are relying on documents and asking people to produce proof that they are in a crisis,” a senior officer said.Officers of a central Calcutta police station received a request on Friday from a woman seeking permission to travel to Hooghly. “She could not produce any document in support of her claim that she had an emergency. So, we had to reject her request,” said an officer of the police station.“We are trying to make people understand that social visits can wait. One can be allowed to step out only if there is a medical emergency or a question of life and death,” the officer added.Officers The Telegraph spoke to said the vehicle count on the roads had come down considerably.Most of the four-wheelers and two-wheelers spotted on the roads were stopped and questioned.Officers said a bigger challenge was to contain people walking on the roads.“People are visiting sweet shops. Some are stopping by to gossip, while others are just roaming around,” an officer posted in north Calcutta said.The police are trying to convince such people to stay indoors and, if needed, are prosecuting a few to set an example in the locality.",2020-04-04 20:06:00
212,Meghdeep Bhattacharyya,Coronavirus Lockdown: Lights-off drive sends shock wave in Bengal - Telegraph India,"The Bengal power sector has been forced into a dizzying scramble to counter the possible fallout of the sudden electricity load reduction at 9pm on Sunday followed by a demand surge that the Prime Minister’s lights-out call will entail.The state’s main stakeholders — the generation, transmission and distribution utilities, besides the power department — have been consulting and preparing for Sunday evening in coordination with the Power System Operation Corporation Ltd (Posoco) and the Power Grid Corporation of India. Posoco manages the country’s electricity load. “It is not about the quantum of reduction in power demand. That can be handled by the grid. It is the rate of change of unprecedented proportions that could cause problems. The impact of that is what we are trying to minimise,” Bengal power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged the nation to switch off all lights in tandem for nine minutes from 9pm on Sunday in a gesture symbolising India’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Sources in the Bengal power department said that after the daylong meetings, chief minister Mamata Banerjee was briefed about all the possibilities and how the power department was trying to minimise the impact of a possible glitch caused by the high variations in demand in such a short span of time. In its assessment, Posoco has found that the nine-minute lights-out exercise is likely to result in a load reduction of around 13,000MW across the country, of which Bengal’s share is likely to be around 1,400MW.Posoco issued an advisory on Saturday saying: “Unlike normal operations, this reduction in load of the order of 12-13GW (1GW=1,000 MW) would happen in 2-4 minutes and recover nine minutes later within 2-4 minutes.” In Bengal, the power demand has been lower than usual for this time of the year because of the lockdown. The total demand in the state otherwise is estimated to peak at 7,000MW on Sunday, one-fifth (1,400MW) of which is likely to be shorn off during the nine-minute window. The demand is expected to fall to around 5,600MW.“Lighting is otherwise not a major part of the load…. On Sunday, it is expected that the essential services will remain operational. Besides, domestic appliances will also stay on. But if millions of households do switch off their lights during that nine-minute window, it will have a considerable impact. The plans are based on estimates on how much the demand will dip, but the problem is working out the estimate is easier said than done,” said a power department source.Against this backdrop, coming to the rescue of the state could be the 900MW pumped-storage facility in Purulia. Unlike power generation from water and gas, generation from coal cannot be switched on and off instantly.“During the nine-minute event, while load crashing begins, the state-run distribution utility (WBSEDCL) will ramp down the generation from the Purulia facility to zero, keeping pace with the rate of crash. This will ensure maintenance of vital grid discipline,” said a power department source.Grid discipline, said several power sector officials, is of utmost importance. Without this, grid frequency — a vital aspect of power system operations — could change drastically from the 50 Hertz, around which it is kept in line with global standards.According to the power department plan, after the event the upward surge of demand will be mitigated by ramping up the generation from Purulia, while simultaneously imposing thermal generation backdown. The quick ramping up and down will be handled by the state load despatch centre, one of the country’s 33 such facilities. The national grid can swiftly transfer 99,000MW across the country.Because Mamata has taken a stand against politicising the fight against Covid-19 and contradicting Modi or his government publicly, seniors in her government and party were unwilling to comment on record on the Prime Minister-ordained event.“First of all, it was totally unnecessary. More importantly, by not consulting the power ministry and its experts, the Prime Minister has thrown the possibility of immense danger in the way of the grid,” said a senior minister.",2020-04-04 20:06:00
215,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus outbreak: Mamata thanks Shah Rukh for Covid-19 help  - Telegraph India,"Mamata Banerjee on Saturday thanked actor Shah Rukh Khan for his decision to contribute to Bengal’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic.The chief minister tweeted her statement in the morning, after Shah Rukh, according to sources in the government, pledged Rs 2.5 crore to the state’s fund to combat the Covid-19 outbreak, besides other assistance. The sources said the superstar, also Bengal’s brand ambassador, had called up Mamata on Friday night and spoken to her about his offer. “Thank you @iamsrk, your contribution will help assist a lot of distressed people during these challenging times,” Mamata tweeted.“Such humane benefaction will keep inspiring millions in this country who look up to you as their role model with respect and reverence,” she added.Later in the day, Shah Rukh replied to Mamata’s post in a tweet that had a smattering of Bengali.“Didi, apnar nihshwartho manobik kaaje, ekti bhai hoye haat barano amar kortobyo (Didi, extending my hand to support your selfless humanitarian work is my duty as your brother),” he wrote.“Aami Kolkata (I am Calcutta), we believe... ‘I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy’ — Rabindranath Tagore,” Shah Rukh added in English.Mamata replied: “So nice of you and your sweet words @iamsrk, I am indeed blessed to have someone who always tries to keep up and fulfil his duties of a brother.“All of us in Bengal love you and pray for your good health. Keep up your good work, stay safe and take care of your family.”The sources said Shah Rukh has promised 50,000 units of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Bengal and Maharashtra, besides promising to help with getting more contributions. According to the sources, the actor also pledged Rs 2.5 crore during his conversation with Mamata.“He told her this was just the beginning and he was going to come forward with further assistance…. She was very pleased with the gesture,” a source said. “They share a bond... have great mutual love and admiration. This was not unexpected.”While thanking Shah Rukh, also the co-owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders cricket team, Mamata had been responding to an earlier tweet by the actor announcing the steps he was taking to support government efforts.“In these times it’s imp to make everyone around u working tirelessly for u… not related to u… perhaps even unknown to u... to feel they are not alone and by themselves. Let’s just make sure we all do our little bit to look after each other. India and all Indians are One Family,” Shah Rukh had tweeted.SRK has pledged support to the governments of Bengal, Maharashtra and Delhi. He will also contribute to the PM-CARES Fund.The actor has also expressed his keenness to support the first responders, such as healthcare professionals, and help the underprivileged, especially in Calcutta, Mumbai and New Delhi.",2020-04-04 20:15:00
216,Subhajoy Roy And Pranesh Sarkar,Coronavirus outbreak: 4 released from Beleghata hospital on Saturday - Telegraph India,"Bengal’s health department has started identifying potential clusters or hotspots of Covid-19 cases, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said at a news conference on Saturday.“We have started work to identify hotspots and clusters from where positive cases are likely to rise in the future. The figures we have collected on people returning from abroad or other states, surge in fever cases or rise in respiratory distress in a particular area will be put on GIS map to identify the hotspots,” Sinha said.Public health experts said potential clusters or hotspots were the places from where multiple positive cases could be reported or where many contacts of one or more positive cases could be found.Extensive and aggressive medical surveillance, rapid testing of anyone showing even mild symptoms, enforcement of home quarantine rules and shifting people to hospital are some of the steps that could be taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, from a potential hotspot.A doctor working with the state government said the Centre had identified a number of hotspots across the country but the list does not include any place from Bengal yet.“The Bengal government wants to have an idea about potential hotspots in the state,” the doctor said.“A south Calcutta neighbourhood from where three members of a family and a help tested positive for the disease can be a potential hotspot. Those who tested positive had mingled with many people,” the doctor said.Another potential hotspot could be a pocket in the southeastern part of the city, from where two positive cases were reported. One of the patients died.“It could be classified as a hotspot. But it depends on how the committee of experts appointed by the state government define a hotspot or cluster,” the doctor said.The government, he said, should also keep a close eye on those areas where migrant labourers from other states have returned.Public health experts said once a hotspot was identified, extra precautions needed to be taken to contain the spread of the virus from there.“If anyone shows any symptom, even a mild one, he or she should be tested — a practice not usually followed in other places. A medical team will be on a door-to-door visit to know the health status of all residents. The quarantine rules will be strictly enforced,” a public health expert said.Sources said around 25,000 people from abroad had entered the state over the past few weeks. “It is important to map the areas where these people have visited,” an official said.Chief secretary Sinha said 11 new cases were reported from the state till 4.10pm on Saturday. “Of the 11 new cases, six are from the same family in Kalimpong. There are 49 active cases today,” said Sinha.The Union health ministry’s website said there were 69 confirmed cases in Bengal till Saturday. Active cases are calculated leaving out those who have passed away and those who have been cured.The chief secretary said the expert committee formed by the government would investigate the death of those who had tested positive and decide whether they passed away because of Covid-19 or some other reason. It is a mechanism similar to what the state government had followed during dengue outbreaks.“We have set up four Covid-19 hospitals in Calcutta and 55 hospitals in the districts,” said Sinha.Four Covid-19 patients were discharged from the Beleghata ID hospital on Saturday. Three others had been discharged before. “Another five are in a position to be discharged as they tested negative twice within 24 hours, but they could not be released because their family members were yet to recover,” said Avijit Chowdhury, a doctor who is a member of the committee of experts.",2020-04-04 20:15:00
218,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: Online class on hold in state-aided Madhyamik and Higher Secondary school - Telegraph India,"The state government on Saturday shelved its plan to start virtual classes for students of Classes IX to XII of state-aided Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools following an assessment that tens of thousands of students may miss out on them.Education minister Partha Chatterjee had announced on Friday that virtual classes would be held through a programme to be telecast on DD Bangla between 4pm and 5pm every day for a week from April 7 to 13.The decision was taken to make up for the time lost because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus.The minister said on Saturday that the classes had to be kept on hold because a number of students, guardians and teachers had informed the government that they would not be able to participate in the classes from 4pm to 5pm.“The government would not go ahead with the plan because students, teachers and guardians were not happy with the 4pm-5pm time slot. They wanted the programme to be telecast in different time slots,” he said.“In such a situation, we have decided not to start the classes for the time being.”An official in the education department said there was no clarity on when and how the plan to hold online classes would be implemented. The official said many teachers and heads of state-aided schools in remote rural areas had complained that a large number of students would not benefit from the classes because either electricity had not reached their homes or they did not have a TV set.The Bengal government had recently declared that it had achieved 100 per cent rural electrification. But many families in remote villages in the state have not yet applied for electricity connection because they cannot afford to pay the bill, an official in the power department said.Many who have got electricity connection do not have a TV set at home. “In such a situation, it is not possible to start virtual classes through DD Bangla,” an official said.The headmaster of a school in Diamond Harbour said the parents of more than half his students were small-time farmers. “Around 55 students are in Class IX in my school. More than 20 of them do not have a TV set at home. How can I expect them to attend the virtual class?” asked the headmaster.",2020-04-04 20:16:00
219,Sambit Saha And Avijit Sinha,Exemption for tea gardens during the coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"The Centre has permitted tea plantations to function during the lockdown period but tacked on a rider that only 50 per cent of the workforce can be engaged for work, stirring apprehensions of local resistance to the plan.In a letter written to the chief secretaries of the states, including Bengal and Assam, Union home secretary Ajit Bhalla granted the concession as part of the modified consolidated guidelines - the fifth revision in the past 10 days - that determine which operations can remain open during the 21-day lockdown.Understandably, the tea gardens aren't exactly ecstatic at the prospect of running their operations. They believe that everything will work tickety-boo only if the state government gives them a green light as well and the labour unions and political parties signal their approval.The production of tea, even at a limited capacity, will greatly benefit 87 gardens in Darjeeling that are at grave risk of losing out their premium first flush production this year.Just when the gardens in the hills of Bengal were looking forward to an early resumption of operations, local BJP member of Parliament Raju Bista shot off a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah requesting a review of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) concession to the tea gardens.Bista argued that processing of tea takes place in confined places where there is a high risk of workers contracting Covid-19. He also highlighted that several migrant workers who came back to the hills have contracted the virus and many more could be asymptomatic carriers of the disease.'…Getting tea garden workers to once again work outside the ambit of (the) lockdown puts them in harm's way,' Bista wrote to Shah a day after the lockdown.The industry estimates that it could be possible to save 40 per cent of first flush Darjeeling Tea production if the workers return to work from Monday.The Darjeeling gardens produce about 1.5-1.8 million kg of first flush tea, which contributes 30-35 per cent of their annual revenue. In 2019, the gardens produced close to 7.75 million kg of tea.An early resumption of work will help restore the fortunes of the north Indian tea gardens spread across the Dooars and Terai region of Bengal and those in Assam and other pockets in the Northeast.'Over 90 million kgs of teas are produced in north Bengal from March till May (the first and second flush). If the industry remains closed during this period and even if there is no lockdown after the middle of April, we apprehend the industry would lose around 30 million kgs of production. The loss would obviously increase if the lockdown is extended to the monsoon months, that is, May and beyond,' said Amitangshu Chakraborty, principal adviser at the Indian Tea Planters' Association.As per the data available with the Tea Board of India, the total production in north Bengal in 2019 was 424.06 million kgs. Out of it, 25.10 million kgs were produced in March. Tea production in April and May last year amounted to 23.30 million kgs and 43.35 million kgs, respectively.While political opposition could stir the pot at the local level, garden owners are not entirely sure that the administrations in Assam and Bengal will explicitly back the MHA guidelines.Even though the Assam state cabinet has allowed plantations to start operations from April 1, no plucking has begun as the district administrations have not given their formal go-ahead to individuals. The state produces about 100 million kgs of first flush tea.In Bengal too, the state has only allowed clearing bushes and spraying of pesticides till now. Gardens have started writing to the state administrations seeking their approvals after learning of the MHA concession to the tea plantations.  Asked if Nabanna - the administrative headquarters of Bengal - will approve the plan, a senior official said: 'No decision has been taken as yet on the matter.'According to one view, formal approval may not be required after the MHA clarification. 'In the first MHA guideline, it was mentioned that continuous process industries must seek approval from the local state administration. The April 3 guidelines do not mention such a requirement as far as tea plantations are concerned,' a tea industry official argued.Now that the tea gardens have been officially kept out of the lockdown, the owners may try to wriggle out of the commitment to pay wages to workers if they do not turn up.'They (the absentee workers) can be counted as absent permitting deduction of wage. Alternatively, the gardens can announce a lockout if required,' the official added.",2020-04-04 20:16:00
220,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus pandemic: Curbs on masks, sanitisers for shops in Bengal - Telegraph India","Retail drug stores have been barred from storing more than 5 litres of hand sanitisers and more than 200 pieces of two-ply and three-ply surgical masks, state government officials said on Saturday.The health department order which imposed the restrictions also mentioned that a retailer could not stock more than 100 pieces of N95 masks, which are recommended for doctors and others in hospitals coming in close contact with Covid-19 patients.The order states that masks and hand santisers are listed as “essential commodities” and makes it clear that the move is aimed at curbing “hoarding” of these items.“A stockist or a distributor can stock up to 3,000 pieces of two-ply and three-ply surgical masks and up to 1,000 pieces of N95 respirators,” a health department official said.The move by the state government comes around a time when doctors, and nurses and other health-care workers have been raising their pitch in their demand for more hand sanitisers, masks and personal protective equipment, which are a must for those handling suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases.On Saturday, masks and hand sanitisers sold at a premium across Calcutta. In Behala, Jadavpur and Lake Town, customers returned empty-handed from many stores and were asked to come back again on Monday.“At a few stores, N95 masks were being sold for Rs 480 to Rs 1,200,” a south Calcutta-based distributor said.“There are different varieties of N95 masks and the prices vary accordingly,” said the owner of a medicine shop in Kasba. “Price is not a deterrent. Customers are ready to pay anything for masks.”The WHO has said “masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.“Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.”With hand sanitisers, too, flying off the shelves, the government has decided to use its facilities to manufacture alcohol-based sanitisers and use the network of medicine distributors to reach them to the people.The health department on Saturday invited stockists, distributors and clearing agents and requested them to sell government-made hand sanitisers. “The government has sought an estimate of the requirement of hand sanitisers so it can have a production target,” said Sankha Roy Chowdhury, the president of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association.",2020-04-04 20:17:00
221,Monalisa Chaudhuri,"Out on coronavirus season bail, held for phone theft in Calcutta - Telegraph India","A youth released from jail for three months on Wednesday, as part of an attempt to decongest correctional homes to fight the spread of the coronavirus, was arrested in New Alipore on Friday for allegedly stealing a cellphone, officers said.Police said Suman Chetri, 20, a resident of Kamarpara in Behala, had been arrested by officers of Maheshtala police station last year on a theft charge. Following his release on bail, he shifted base to Dhubulia in Nadia.“Chetri and his friend ran a racket that stole motorcycles in Nadia,” an officer said. “They were arrested again. Chetri was lodged at Krishnagar jail on remand. He was among the 3,000-odd inmates released from various jails on bail or parole for three months to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Chetri was released on bail on April 1.”On Friday afternoon, a team from New Alipore police station intercepted Chetri after spotting him loitering around. “Initially, he gave a false name and address. On being questioned he revealed his real name. We found that he was trying to hide his mobile phone, which made us suspicious,” the officer said.After calling up a few contacts on the mobile phone, the cops came to know that it belonged to a man named Kaushik Mitra, a resident of Sisir Bagan Road in Behala. “Mitra’s phone had been stolen an hour before from in front of a sweet shop on NR Avenue in Behala,” the officer said.Based on Mitra’s complaint, officers of New Alipore police station started a theft case and arrested Chetri.Chetri apparently told officers that he had been involved in a laptop theft in an area under Behala police station last year. “Based on his statements, the laptop was recovered today,” an officer said.An official in the state correctional services department said over 3,000 convicts and undertrials were released for three months on parole and bail, respectively, to decongest jails across the state. Undertrials accused of crimes whose maximum punishment is less than seven years in jail and convicts who have served more than 10 years in jail were considered for the temporary release.",2020-04-04 20:17:00
222,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Covid-19 test kiosk in Howrah - Telegraph India,"The Howrah district administration has installed a kiosk to collect swab samples for the Covid-19 test at the quarantine centre in the Dumurjala stadium. At least five such kiosks will start functioning in Howrah city in a couple of days, district administration officials said. “The Howrah Municipal Corporation will install a kiosk each in its health centres in Shibpur, Salkia, Howrah Maidan and Bally. Another kiosk will be installed at Howrah District Hospital,” an official of the district administration said. The kiosks, modelled on those set up in South Korea, have a glass shield that separates the medical technologist collecting the sample, who is inside the kiosk, from the person being tested, who is outside. The technologist does not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) because the glass acts as the shield. A pair of gloves are fitted to the glass of the kiosk. The technologist puts his hands into the gloves and collects the swab samples of the person being tested, who sits on a chair outside.Every time a person is tested, the exterior of the gloves and the chair are disinfected so that no one catches infection from the previous person. Dhaval Jain, the additional district magistrate of Howrah, said the kiosks reduced the risk of health workers getting infected while collecting samples. “The medical technologists feel safe while working from inside the kiosk,” said Jain, who is also commissioner of the Howrah civic body. Jain said the corporation had adopted the dual strategy of collecting samples from kiosks and also visiting neighbourhoods to collect samples.“We collected 100 samples from Sanatan Mistry Lane in Golabari on Sunday. Our personnel wore PPE and visited lanes and bylanes to collect samples of contacts or people with symptoms of Covid-19,” he said. An official said personnel of the corporation conducted an extensive campaign in the locality before the sample collection started on Sunday. Civic personnel will visit Narasingha Dutta Lane in Bantra on Tuesday to collect samples.",2020-04-05 22:49:00
223,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Hospital normality in Kolkata ‘2-3 months away’ - Telegraph India,"Private hospitals in Calcutta would take at least another two to three months “in the best case scenario” to normalise their operations, officials of several healthcare units said on Monday.For some, the wait could be as long as six months.The count of doctors and others involved in healthcare of almost every hospital has been reduced to almost a third on an average because back-up teams have been created from the existing staff to ensure departments are not shut down in the event of an employee getting infected with the coronavirus.There is also a fear factor among a section of healthcare workers, especially nurses, that has triggered a shortage of staff. Another hurdle to returning to normality, hospitals said, was the requirement for indoor patients to spend at least two additional days at the hospital for Covid-19 tests.The OPDs of most hospitals have started seeing a rise in the number of doctors and patients. Elective surgeries, too, are being performed. But the numbers are small compared with the capacity of each.The state health department had on Friday issued a directive asking private hospitals to “undertake a plan for time bound resumption/normalisation of services ....” The resumption of services must include outpatient department and day-care services.On Monday, the Belle Vue Clinic authorities held a meeting with doctors to prepare a plan and guidelines for resumption of normality. The hospital has 250 doctors and the meeting was held with 40.“We have set up rules for OPD…. The number of furniture at the OPD was reduced to half on Monday to ensure social distancing,” said Pradip Tondon, the CEO of Belle Vue. The patients will have to take appointments over the phone and the test reports will be mailed to them. “The follow-up consultation will be by video conference,” he said.The hospital in normal times conducts 25 surgeries every day on an average. “But now we are targeting 12 to 15,” said Tondon.Other hospitals, too, said normal operations would not be possible now.“We will take about three months to return to normality if the Covid-19 curve flattens and the lockdown is withdrawn. We are having one-third strength of doctors, healthcare workers and administrative staff. There is one back-up group and two other sets of employees are working in alternate weeks,” said Alok Roy, the chairman of Medica Superspecialty Hospital.He said that would mean fewer patients and the system would continue for now.Woodlands Hospital had 40-odd patients in its OPD on Monday, against the usual daily count of 300. Rupali Basu, the director and CEO of the hospital, said it would take some time for the number to rise.Most of the hospitals that have not been designated as Covid-19 treatment centres have been asked by the health department to admit suspected or positive cases, which will require setting up of separate teams for the Covid-19 wards.All hospitals are testing all patients being admitted, including the asymptomatic ones, for Covid-19. But most are yet to get permission to conduct the tests in their laboratories, which is increasing the stay of a patient by at least a couple of days, said officials. “Normality cannot be restored in a day. Our priorities are OPD activities, the emergency wing and surgeries. Virtual OPD is also the new normal,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.",2020-04-05 22:53:00
224,Subhajoy Roy,Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim coronavirus lockdown message - Telegraph India,"Lockdown measures cannot be violated in containment zones, mayor Firhad Hakim told councillors in a meeting on Monday.Councillors should also follow distancing norms and desist from distributing relief themselves because it can lead to crowding, he said. The relief being given by the state government is adequate and councillors should alert the corporation or government officials if anyone needs relief material, Hakim said at the meeting.At least 45 councillors attended the meeting. Most were from north and central Calcutta, which have reported close to 70 per cent of the city’s Covid-19 cases. More than 650 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the city so far, a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) official said.A containment zone is an area surrounding a house, which has reported a Covid-19 positive patient. The lane or road in front of the house or the lane/road leading to it is considered a containment zone, the CMC official said.Roughly 300-350 houses surrounding an affected house fall in a containment zone, another official said. Police have installed barricades and cut off entry/exit points to and from these zones, the official said.There are more than 300 containment zones in the city now, a councillor who attended the meeting said. “The mayor said that strict lockdown measures must be continued in containment zones. There should be no relaxation in these zones. He asked us to see to it that strict distancing was maintained in places outside containment zones.”Hakim said relief distribution often led to crowding and violation of distancing norms, another councillor said.The state government has allowed certain relaxations in areas outside containment zones such as opening grocery  shops and liquor stores.“This could lead to people wanting to step out of containment zones. That has to be stopped, the mayor said. It was stressed at the meeting that people within containment zones cannot behave like areas outside it,” another councillor said.In a containment zone, no one is allowed to go beyond the zone’s boundary, marked by police barricades, the councillor said.Grocery and other essential items are supposed to be brought to the barricades for residents. “The seller will stand on one side of the barricade while the buyer on the other side. The seller cannot enter and the buyer cannot step out,” a CMC official said.A containment zone is cut off from other places to ensure no one who might have been in contact with a positive patient ventures out and helps in the spread of the virus, a CMC official said.",2020-04-05 22:59:00
225,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Hygiene kits for women in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A city girl who started a menstrual hygiene awareness initiative last year is distributing reusable sanitary pads among poor women. Ananya Chhaochharia, 24, has raised about Rs 4 lakh through crowdfunding and personal donations to distribute 2,000-odd menstrual kits in and around Calcutta and other Indian cities through NGOs that work in the communities. Each kit of three reusable washable pads  costs approximately Rs 250. The former student of Modern High School for Girls started procuring and distributing the pads in the first week of April after she heard stories of women reusing dirty commercial pads or reverting to homemade alternatives such as scraps of cloth during the lockdown. Many of these women were worried about livelihood and could not afford to buy pads. “Women across India have unfairly been made to choose between basic needs of food, clothes and shelter and their sanitary needs. What many don’t realise is menstruation is not a matter of choice but part of the natural process,” Ananya said.She has distributed 5,000 kits across the country.Ananya, who is scheduled to go to Harvard Kennedy School for masters in public policy, launched the Paint it Red initiative in September 2019 to create awareness about menstrual hygiene, prompted by a personal experience. She was travelling through rural Bihar on a job assignment in January 2019 when she started menstruating out of schedule and could not find sanitary pads in nearly 250km. “It was like a slap on my face and opened my eyes to reality,” she said.The cloth pads being distributed as part of her latest campaign, Bleed in Peace during Covid-19, are being produced by Anahat for Change Foundation, an NGO that works on women’s health and child safety. “A group of women in Diamond Harbour is making them now and it is the only source of livelihood for them during the lockdown,” said Purvi Tanwani, co- founder of Anahat.It was the uncertainty of the pandemic that forced Ananya to seek “sustainable options”. “The cloth pads are leak-proof and with every pack we give a user manual, which says the pads have to be dried under direct sunlight. If properly used, the pads can last for several months, which will not only take care of the immediate needs of the women but also empower them for the entire duration of the Covid-19 crisis, however long that may be. Cloth pads are also a familiar product, easy to use and maintain for women belonging to marginalised communities,” she said.Both Ananya and Anahat have received grants from the German consulate to distribute kits to women in Bengal.",2020-04-05 23:13:00
226,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: Food relief by Belghoria theatre group  - Telegraph India,"Migrant labourers from Bengal and Jharkhand  would cook meals at the roadside stalls around Belghoria station every day for thousands of people.They used to work in the 100-odd stalls and small eateries in the station area that are now shut because of the lockdown. So, they have to now depend on others for their food.A local theatre group has come forward to provide them with food. Most of the workers hail from Asansol, Birbhum, Shantipur and Jharkhand, Debashis Sengupta, the director of Ethic Theatre Group, said.“All these workers are jobless because the food stalls are closed. They are not eligible for ration and relief being supplied by the government because they are from other districts,” Sengupta said.The workers would roam the station area the whole day and spend the night inside the stalls, going almost without any food, he said. “When we got to know of it, we decided to make some arrangements to provide them with food.”A community kitchen has been set up for the workers. “The kitchen is unique in the sense; many among the workers are expert cooks and they are helping in the whole exercise of cooking meals,” he said. “Some of these boys have volunteered their services as cooks.”The 20-year-old theatre group had been performing till March. The shows stopped when the Centre announced the lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the members got together, along with a few people of the area, to provide the poor and the jobless with food.The group started providing lunch, prepared at Sengupta’s house, in March. When the number of recipients increased, the kitchen was set up on the station premises on April 14. Since then, the group has been providing 270-280 people with food daily.The group initially started with rice, daal, a vegetable curry and at times a non-vegetarian item for lunch. Sengupta and his wife, who is part of the theatre group, wanted to donate “a little extra”. “So, we have been sponsoring dinner, which consists of rotis, a vegetable curry and a boiled egg or a banana, since April 18,” Sengupta said. Close to 110 people are served dinner every day.There are a few doctors among the donors. The group has organised medical check-ups for the workers with the help of these doctors and provided them with medicines, too.The rail authorities have agreed to allow the group to use a small place on the station premises for cooking.The authorities of a temple have provided the group with utensils, which are used to cook 'bhog' on normal days.",2020-04-05 23:16:00
228,Chandreyee Ghose,Wall art imparts coronavirus lessons - Telegraph India,"A 22-year-old art student has used cartoons and caricature to spread awareness about Covid-19 in his village in Murshidabad district.Animesh Mondal, a final-year student of the College of Art and Design, University of Burdwan, returned to his village at the start of the lockdown  to find none following any rules.“I hail from this small village, Bhajarampur Gram, of around  200 households. When I realised that my neighbours  had little awareness about Covid-19 and its dangers, I thought of doing something,”  said the art student who is specialising to become a sculptor.Animesh got together with a few childhood friends and got down to work. The idea was to spread awareness about Covid-19 and give lessons in personal hygiene. “I was carrying some paint. I bought some more and borrowed some from a friend who paints houses. Together, we started creating interesting illustrations on walls to spread awareness about the virus,' Animesh said.The artist used Mickey Mouse and some of his own creations to tell people to stay indoors. “In my village, people were not even washing hands regularly. Only a few had sanitisers or wore masks. Social distancing was an unheard of concept to them. People were crowding shops and bazaars instead of maintaining social distance,”said Animesh, whose wall art and caricatures spoke about all that and more.“We also highlighted how children and senior citizens should be particularly careful as they are the most vulnerable,' said the artist, who was helped by two friends.Animesh and his friends initially targetted walls in public places.“Villagers were not keen on letting us paint on the boundary walls of their houses. But after seeing some illustrations some of them invited me to draw on their walls too,” Animesh said.The visuals have prompted many to change habits.“They lacked the awareness but I was able to get them to be more cautious through art,” said the student.",2020-04-05 23:18:00
229,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Residents of Nandibagan and Uriyapara in Howrah’s Golabari hang bags, youths fill them in Howrah - Telegraph India","A group of young men has been taking care of the daily needs of the residents of Nandibagan and Uriyapara in Howrah’s Golabari, both of which are containment zones, as no one is allowed to step out of their homes.Residents of the area hang bags from the gates of their houses with a list of required  items.The youths, who have teamed up with the cops, ensure that the families get everything from groceries to medicines.Over 400 families received rice and wheat from the only ration shop open in the neighbourhood on Monday.Nandibagan and Uriyapara, where the youths have been working, are part of wards 10 and 15 of the Howrah Municipal Corporation and among the 74 wards declared as “containment zone”.Since Howrah was declared a red zone, along with Calcutta and North 24-Parganas, these two wards were marked containment zones. This meant all movements were restricted and no one was allowed to go out .The Howrah district administration geared up for complete clampdown as the death count from Covid-19 crossed 15 in the district. Over 200 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Howrah. “There are 1,028 card holders at the ration shop and we realised that all of them needed rice and pulses as their stocks were running out,” said one of the youths from Nandibagan.“We had asked them to drop their bags along with the cards outside their homes. Volunteers went around collecting the cards on Sunday and from early on Monday, we started visiting the ration shop with the cards and picked up supplies. These were then delivered in e-rickshaws,” the youth said,Residents thanked the youths for saving them a trip to the ration shop and standing in queue. “It is a challenge to visit the shop every week to collect our supplies because of the long queue. Still, I have to because there is no one else to do this job,” said Alpona Koley, who lives near Taltala maidan. “The way these youths came forward today is amazing. I bless these youths for the wonderful job.”",2020-04-05 23:21:00
231,Our Special Correspondent,Two arrested for selling kites near Park Circus - Telegraph India,"Two men, who were selling and flying kites on the main thoroughfare near Park Circus, were arrested on Tuesday evening. Police have prohibited both selling and flying kites near flyovers following incidents of motorcyclists getting injured or killed with kite threads coated with a mixture of glue and glass powder.The arrests came two days after several people were arrested across Tiljala, Topsia, Beniapukur and Karaya for sale of kites and kite threads in a joint raid conducted by the respective police station and the officers of the detective department.The arrested persons were identified as Sheikh Bapi, 25, of GJ Khan Road and Mohammad Aurangzeb, 24, of Dilkhusha Street.“One of them was selling kites and spools rolled with manja sitting on the road. The other was flying a kite standing on the main road, causing obstruction on the thoroughfare which too could have led to accidents,” said an officer of Topsia police station.Several cases have been reported in the past where motorcyclists or persons riding two-wheelers have either been injured or killed while plying along Parama flyover or AJC Bose flyover after their faces or throat were slashed with kite threads.On Tuesday evening, the police seized 12 kites and three kite flying spools.",2020-04-06 00:04:00
232,"Subhajoy Roy, Pinak Ghosh, Debraj Mitra And Subhankar Chowdhury ","Cyclone Amphan: Two weeks on, some wounds yet to heal - Telegraph India","TreesTree branches are still lying by the roadside in many places. They have been cleared from most part of the city, though, according to traffic police officers and Calcutta Municipal Corporation engineers. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had removed large trees from Kalakar Street and BK Pal Avenue on Tuesday, a police officer said.A portion of Rashbehari Avenue was blocked near Triangular Park on Wednesday as CMC workers removed an uprooted tree. A CMC engineer said there were problems in getting machines and people immediately after the cyclone. “But we have hired advanced machinery from various private agencies to transport the uprooted trees.Almost all roads have been cleared,” the CMC engineer said.Metro, though, found uprooted trees and branches lying along stretches of Hazra Road and in parts of Ballygunge on Wednesday.Rainwater catch pitsAgencies clearing roads of uprooted trees had pushed them by the roadside, blocking the catch pits through which rainwater reaches into sewers.Tarak Singh, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators who heads the drainage department, said “only about four per cent of catch pits” remained blocked by trees. They will be cleared before the monsoon, Singh said.Private engineers, who know the city’s sewer design, said if the foliage had slipped into the sump of catch pits it could block the channels that carry water to the main drainage line. “These sumps have to be cleaned,” an engineer said.Sumps are cleaned round the year and there is no threat of flooding from clogged sumps, Singh said.“Even during the lockdown, our men have been cleaning the sumps. There are 74 pumping stations run by the CMC and 389 pumps installed in these stations. All these pumps are in working condition,” Singh said.Cyclone Amphan had raged across Calcutta on May 20, killing people and uprooting trees and lamp posts or leaving them to lean dangerously.The storm snapped power lines and disrupted phone and Net connectivity. Utility services have been restored at most places but some problems still exist. Metro finds out how much normality has been restored.Power supplyPeople in several pockets of Tollygunge, Jadavpur and Behala went without electricity for more than a week after the cyclone.The power utility, CESC, initially provided households in these areas with a temporary connection that allowed every house to run a light and a fan or two lights and two fans. Now, supplies have been fully restored in almost all these places, a CESC spokesperson said on Wednesday.A resident of Regent Estate — one of the worst-hit areas, which went without electricity for more than a week — said connections had been restored. “We are now able to use AC units, refrigerators and water pumps to draw water from underground reservoirs to overhead tanks,” the resident said.Behala, Regent Estate, Ranikuthi, and pockets of Kasba and Jadavpur were without electricity as power lines on metal poles had snapped.All places in CESC’s jurisdiction have at least some amount of electricity, the spokesperson said. “In most places we have restored full connection. Only in some pockets, some houses still have temporary connections… but full and permanent connections will be restored very quickly.”Lamp postsMetro has reported that damaged lamp posts and metal poles pose a safety risk to people out on roads. Such lamp posts and metal poles can be found in Kasba, Lansdowne and Ballygunge, among others. The police had sent a list of such poles to the CMC, an officer said. There has been little action on the ground, the officer said.Net connectivityCalcuttans still have to make do with poor Net connectivity.Around 95 per cent of the city’s wired and wireless telecom network that had been affected by the cyclone has been restored but service quality is still poor. Voice calls are patchy; there are call drops, and data services are inconsistent.Telcom companies have two major concerns — fibre cuts as uprooted trees are being cleared and voltage fluctuations despite restoration of power in most parts of the city. As a result the load on running network sites at any point goes up to compensate for other sites.Telecom service operators have deployed diesel generator sets, battery backups and movable network sites. Cables are being replaced wherever there are fibre cuts.Government-owned BSNL has been able to restore its landline and broadband services after some of its telephone exchanges faced fibre cuts and power issues.Intra-circle roaming has started but it is still not entirely successful. Subscribers are able to connect to other network towers but often calls don’t go through.Cable and DTH servicesCable and direct-to-home (DTH) services are still not working in many places.Multi-system operators and DTH players are still struggling to cope with complaints. Shortage of manpower and logistical challenges in moving equipment because of the lockdown are the major hindrances to restoring normal services.Representatives of MSOs and cable operators met Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators, on Tuesday. Better coordination between the civic body, CESC and MSOs in fixing metal poles that carry Internet cables and television ones can now be expected, an MSO official said. It will take “at least one more week” to restore unhindered Net services, the official said.",2020-04-06 00:14:00
233,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Some doctors set terms for return  - Telegraph India,"A section of doctors in Calcutta is demanding OT-like sanitisation, very select patients and higher fees, among other things, for returning to clinics and hospitals.Doctors in many private hospitals and clinics have started seeing patients but many are yet to return to their chambers because the coronavirus pandemic is still raging.Hospitals are talking to doctors about the terms and conditions for their return to their chambers.A senior ENT surgeon who has not started seeing patients yet has told the management of the private hospital he is attached to that he would like to wait for some more time.“The government has advised people aged above 60 to be careful and doctors are human beings, too. So, he asked me whether it was wrong to be careful and not see patients since he is above 65,” an official of the private hospital said.At some hospitals, doctors are asking for a fee hike because if they start seeing patients, it would be much less in number compared to earlier times and there would also be risks involved.“Some of the doctors who have not yet started seeing patients, and even the few who have joined, are asking for a fee hike. But we have told them it was not possible,” Pradip Tondon, the CEO of Belle Vue Clinic, said on Thursday. “We have decided not to raise the fees for one year.”Officials of the hospital said nearly 50 per cent of the doctors were yet to resume seeing patients.At a few other private hospitals, too, the authorities said they were getting requests from doctors to increase their fees.Also, doctors are asking the hospitals and polyclinics to cut down the number of patients. A gastroenterologist has told the hospital he is attached to that he would see barely five patients a day, instead of more than 30 that he used to before the lockdown.A private clinic in south Calcutta had planned that each doctor would see 15 patients on their scheduled days. But many doctors have said they would not see more than 10 and a few want to fix appointments on their own, instead of letting the clinics do so.An official of the clinic said the doctors wanted enough time for cleaning and sanitisation in between seeing two patients.At AMRI Hospitals, many doctors are seeking assurance that the authorities have taken all safety measures against Covid-19.“We have to make video calls with doctors and show them the kind of sanitisation and other safety measures we have taken in their OPD chambers,” said Rupak Barua, the Group CEO of the hospital chain. “About 60 per cent of the doctors have resumed seeing patients and we are expecting the number to go up to 80 to 90 per cent by this weekend.”Barua said many doctors were insisting on seeing fewer patients than they used to before the lockdown was imposed.Last week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had urged private doctors to return to their clinics. “I want to tell private doctors — doctors attached to private hospitals and private clinics. Please use PPE kits. Please use sanitisers. Take all the required protection but start seeing some patients,” Mamata had said. “If there are too many people, there could be a problem. You need to put a system in place. Do not grant many appointments on one day. Grant some appointments.”The state government has also asked the private hospitals and clinics to resume normal functions. But many of the healthcare institutes are still functioning with depleted strength.Peerless Hospital this week issued an “appeal” to its doctors to return to work. “We have told the doctors that all safety measures have been taken. We have told them that the hospital is functioning normally and they should return. Almost all doctors have responded positively and have started seeing patients,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of the hospital.",2020-04-06 21:46:00
234,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: Council seeks ICSE pre-board marks - Telegraph India,"The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on Thursday asked its affiliated schools for the ICSE pre-board test marks of all candidates who are appearing in the Class X board exams.The schools will have to provide the marks of all subjects (out of 100) for which the candidates had been registered to appear in the ICSE exams this year.The council has asked for the marks because it has started “collating” the students’ marks for “reference and statistical reasons”, according to a notice issued by Gerry Arathoon, the chief executive and secretary of the CISCE. Copies of the notice were sent to all ICSE schools on Thursday.The ICSE 2020 exams began on February 27 and were supposed to continue till March 30.The CISCE had postponed the exams on March 19 as a precautionary measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus.The CISCE notice sent to the schools said the pre-board exam marks would have to be uploaded on the CAREERS portal of the council through the internal assessment module on or before June 14, according to the notice.The ICSE pre-board exams are conducted by the individual schools.The principals of many ICSE schools said this was the first time the schools had been asked to submit the pre-board marks to the council.The CISCE notice reads: “The CISCE is in a process of collating the Pre-board Examination Marks of candidates appearing for the ICSE 2020 Examination for reference and statistical reasons. In this regard, you are requested to kindly provide the PRE-BOARD EXAMINATION MARKS (out of 100) of each candidate from your school, for all the subjects/papers for which the candidate has been registered to appear….”Six papers of ICSE 2020 are pending — geography, biology, economics, Group III elective, Hindi and art paper 4.

235,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: MLA diktat on school fees triggers query over power - Telegraph India,"Trinamul MLA Baishali Dalmiya has issued a notice to private schools in her constituency in Howrah’s Bally asking them not to take fees from students for April, May and June.Several schools in the area raised the question whether an MLA had the “power” to ask them to waive off fees of every student. The notice, on Dalmiya’s  letterhead as “Member, West Bengal Legislative Assembly”, was put up outside the gates of the schools or mailed to the managements.“This is hereby inform to all the Authorities of Schools under Bally Constituency not to take any kind of fees from parents of respective students of your school for the months of April, May & June 2020 and no admission charges to the existing students for the new session as well as no bus fares for the last 3 months as per the directives of Education Ministry of Government of West Bengal,” the notice reads.No order has been issued by the state government so far regarding waiving students’ fees for the three months, the schools said.Metro asked education minister Partha Chatterjee whether an MLA could issue such a notice without the government’s approval. He said that as education minister, he could not comment on an MLA’s decision.“But I will definitely talk to her and find out what prompted her to ask the schools not to take fees,” Chatterjee said.All 35 schools served the notice are part of Dalmiya’s constituency, across Liluah, Belur and Bally.Dalmiya said that “as an individual” and “also as the local MLA”, she felt she had the responsibility to “request” the schools to give some relief to the parents. She said several parents were suffering because the lockdown had robbed them of their earnings.“Schools charge fees from students from Nursery to Class XII. We are all going through a difficult time. Many parents have no income. They are suffering. Why can’t the schools offer them some relief by not charging any fees for three months?” Dalmiya told this newspaper.According to Dalmiya, the schools’ expenses have gone down because they have not been operating since the lockdown had been imposed.“The schools teach students to be kind, to help the needy and to be honest. This is the time when the schools should practise what they teach their students,” she said.Asked how the schools would pay the teachers and other employees if the students did not pay fees, the MLA said: “Schools will have to arrange the teachers’ salaries.”“The government asked us not to implement the fee hike this year. We have not implemented it.... We have not forced any parent to pay the fees if they had difficulty…. How can an MLA ask us not to take fees from any student for three months?” a principal asked.",2020-04-06 21:49:00
236,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 10km of defunct cables removed in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"More than 10km of dud cables were removed from posts on just one stretch of Harish Mukherjee Road on Thursday.Many other areas in the city will be cleared of such cables, said multi-system operators (MSOs) and broadband service providers.The push came at a meeting on Tuesday between the operators and Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators. Sources said Hakim had a stern message for the operators — remove the defunct cables as soon as possible.Old cables that have long outlived their utility have been dangling from posts, all jumbled up, for years. Civic officials have attributed the high count of electric poles felled by Cyclone Amphan to the weight of cables on them.The jobAround six MSOs and a couple of broadband providers sent teams to Harish Mukherjee Road on Thursday morning. They worked well into the afternoon but could only cover a portion of the road.“We covered around 20 lamp posts from Mitra Institution to Balwant Singh Dhaba,” said Niloy Sarkar, a worker in the team of GTPL-KCBPL.The process took time because the workers found it tough to tell a defunct cable from a functional one.The total length of the defunct cables removed from the road would be “well over 10km”, said Suresh Sethia, the director of Siti Cable.Stretches in Alipore will be taken up after Harish Mukherjee Road is free of defunct wires, MSOs said.A senior official of another MSO said at least 100 trucks would be needed to carry all the dud wires from the city.The challengeRemoving dud cables is a baby step towards fixing the overhead menace, said civic officials and urban planners. The real solution was building underground conduits, they said. But the job is easier said than done.Metro had in May 2019 reported that the CMC had readied a plan to bury the mesh of dangling cables. But the project never took off.“Late last year, the plan was sent to the state government for approval. The money was supposed to have come from the government, not the civic body. The approval is still pending,” said a CMC official.Architect and urban planner Abin Chaudhuri said it was ironic that it took a calamity for people to take notice of the overhead cable menace.“During normal times, we insist the local cable operator draws a cable through that very mess. We are also to blame,” he said.",2020-04-06 21:51:00
237,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: Fee dues piling up: Schools - Telegraph India,"Many private schools have sought the state government’s intervention to overcome a financial crisis they are facing because of parents’ unwillingness to pay their children’s fees for the third consecutive month (June).Most private schools depend entirely on students’ fees to run the institutions, pay the teachers and other employees.Many private schools affiliated to the ICSE, CBSE and Madhyamik boards have complained to the government that 60 to 80 per cent of the parents have not paid the fees for April and May and are reluctant to clear the dues even in June. As a result, the schools have told the government that they are exposed to “severe financial constraints”, an official in the school education department said.The owner of a middle-ranking ICSE school said he had to spend Rs 18 lakh every month on salaries. In April, the school received fees totalling Rs 4.5 lakh, which means the management had to spend Rs 13.5 lakh from its reserve fund to meet the deficit.In May, the collection had further come down to Rs 3 lakh. “The June collection could be even lower,” he said. Many schools have written to the state government that they have rolled back the enhanced fees which they had planned to implement from the 2020 academic session. They have also submitted compliance reports to the education department, which the government had asked for in April.“…Private unaided schools by and large have given a compliance report to the respective District Inspector of Schools stating that we have rolled back our current year’s school fees to the level of the previous year i.e. 2019-2020…. In spite of the same, most of our Parents/Guardians are not paying fees…. It is now becoming humongous task for the management to meet up all expenditure and carry on the online lessons, which incurs additional cost if Parents /Guardians do not cooperate. Kindly look into the matter…” reads a letter written to the government by one of the schools. After the lockdown was imposed on March 25, parents had complained to the government about their difficulties in paying fees because of salary cuts, job loss and the general slump in the economy.On the basis of appeals by parents, the state government had directed the private schools in April not to implement the enhanced fees and also not to put “pressure” on guardians to pay the fees on time for the next few months.Ranjan Mitter, the secretary of the Bengal chapter of the Association of Schools of Indian School Certificate, said several institutions were facing financial constraints. “The schools have been forced to write to the government and seek its intervention,” said Mitter.",2020-04-06 21:52:00
238,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Fare hike or more passengers, it cuts both ways for Autorickshaw drivers of Kolkata - Telegraph India","Autorickshaw drivers are in a Catch-22 situation. If they double the fare to make up for the drastic fall in passenger count, people are not always willing to pay.If the drivers decide to ferry four people on each trip, they run the risk of scaring away potential passengers.In such a situation, some auto operators and their leaders, who otherwise lord over the streets, don’t know the way forward.On at least three routes, Metro saw operators pleading with passengers to pay more, if possible, considering that no more than two people could take a ride at a time.In Calcutta, auto operators are not known to make requests. From running an auto on split routes to demanding extra fare, they usually have the last word.The prolonged lockdown, the fear of the disease and the resultant financial impact have dented the won’t-bend attitude of at least some auto operators.On routes such as Ranikuthi-Jadavpur 8B and Golpark-Jadavpur, it appeared that even as the government was trying to normalise the city’s mass transport, the reality on the ground continued to pinch both operators and passengers.An auto on the usually busy Ranikuthi-Jadavpur 8B route was waiting with two passengers for 15 minutes on Thursday afternoon, while the driver kept shouting that he could ferry two more. Since no one came forward, the driver, Bablu, told the two persons seated in the vehicle that he could start the trip only if they agreed to pay double the fare. The two agreed.“If passengers don’t pay double, I won’t earn enough even for the LPG consumed by the vehicle,” said Bablu. For loading a litre of LPG, he has to pay Rs 36.Now, he is required to fill at least 3litres of gas a day because the passenger count has nosedived. Before the lockdown, the daily requirement was 6litres.Charging the double fare was not always a pleasant experience.While getting off an auto, a middle-aged woman asked the driver why he was asking for double fare. He said: “Think of the reality.”The passenger was heard responding: “We are all suffering, isn’t it?”Sushanta Ghosh and Shankar Sardar, who ply autos on the Ranikuthi-Jadavpur 8B route, said they were not getting passengers because schools, colleges and Jadavpur University were yet to open.Ghosh said he had earned Rs 150 till 4pm on Thursday. “On this route I used to earn Rs 1,200 a day. I don’t know how much I could take home after paying Rs 100 to the owner as the daily rent,” Ghosh said.Most autos on the Baguiati-Ultadanga, Salt Lake-Ultadanga, Karunamoyee-Phoolbagan and Karunamoyee-Beleghata routes are plying with two passengers and asking for extra fare.Additional reporting by Snehal Sengupta",2020-04-06 21:53:00

241,Snehal Sengupta,Cyclone Amphan: Change of heart for civic body on Salt Lake trees - Telegraph India,"The Salt Lake civic body has decided to chop the trees that fell on houses and clear driveways of uprooted trees that were lying unattended since Cyclone Amphan struck the city on May 20.The storm felled more than 3,000 trees in the township.The civic body had earlier left it to residents to clear the trees that had fallen on their houses if they had been planted by them on nearby pavements and median dividers.An official of the corporation said councillors had been asked to prepare a list of houses on which the trees fell. The list has to be readied by Monday.According to the official, the decision to remove the trees was taken at a meeting held in Poura Bhavan.The Telegraph had reported  on June 1 about the plight of the residents on whose houses trees had fallen or were leaning precariously.“Earlier, our teams would go and ask the owners of the houses if the trees that fell on their properties had been planted by them. If they answered in the affirmative, the team would ask the residents to cut the trees on their own,” the official said.Krishna Chakraborty, the mayor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said they would remove all uprooted trees from driveways and houses.According to Chakraborty, they had earlier steered clear of removing trees that had fallen on houses because they wanted the handful of tree-cutting teams to focus entirely on roads and other public places like parks.“Now, most roads in Salt Lake have been cleared and we have managed to remove several big trees that had fallen in parks, too,” said Chakraborty.A senior official in the civic environment department, however, said the reason for the change in stand is the resentment among residents as the fallen trees had not been removed even two weeks after Amphan had struck the city. Despite repeated calls, no one from the civic body turned up to remove the trees.Trees have either fallen on buildings or are leaning on them in several blocks of Salt Lake, including AE, EE, AD, AC, BC and DL.The corporation has around four teams that are working to clear the township of fallen trees. It has, however, only one hydraulic lift, which is needed to reach branches at higher levels.The official said a recent survey had revealed that most of the trees that had fallen on buildings were quite high. The hydraulic lift is needed to remove the trees because the tree top has to be pruned first to reduce the weight.“If we cut near the base of the trunk with the top foliage intact, the tree can veer out of control and injure people or damage property,” said the official.Several residents said the civic body should have removed the trees earlier. Debarjun Saha, who stays in a two-storey house in BC block with his family, said it was a miracle that the krishnachura tree that was hanging dangerously over his balcony had not come crashing down yet.“I am scared for my children,” said Saha.",2020-04-06 22:05:00

The local councillor said he was not aware of the man lying on the road.A resident posted the man’s picture and a note on her failed attempt to shift him to hospital and it garnered attention from several quarters.The Telegraph made queries with the police and councillor Bikas Naskar about their alleged indifference and both initially pleaded helplessness. A few more queries later, the woman got a call from the police. “They were finally ready to do what they could have done two days ago: take the man to a hospital,” said Aditi Basu Roy, the Kestopur resident who led the drive to have the abandoned man rescued.She had spotted him from her fifth-floor apartment, clicked his photograph and posted his plight on the social media.The man, wearing only a green T-shirt, had been lying on a kutcha road near the canal. “I spotted the man on Tuesday afternoon. Since then I have been trying to help him with food and water. Some neighbours are also helping. He needs medical help. The worst fear is, he would be run over by any vehicle as there is no light on this under-construction stretch,” Basu Roy had said before the man was shifted to hospital.Earlier on Thursday evening, police officers said they had tried to shift the man to a hospital but he had “scratched us with his long nails.... We could not force him as he looks weak.”Within an hour after this newspaper started making the queries, a team from Baguiati police station reached the spot with members of an NGO and an ambulance.

244,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Cancellation and quarantine rules hold up fliers - Telegraph India,"Many fliers are getting stuck in Calcutta because airlines are cancelling flights following changes in quarantine rules in some states and poor phone network is leading to passengers missing alerts about changed flight timings.The temporary closure of the Mumbai airport because of cyclonic storm Nisarga was another reason for the fliers getting stranded.Gaurang Dalal, along with three others, was scheduled to fly from Bagdogra to Mumbai through Delhi on an AirAsia flight on June 2. But they were stuck in Calcutta till June 4 afternoon because of cancellations of several flights, he said on Thursday.Dalal, who owns several hotels in Sikkim, was stuck there during the lockdown and was returning home.“We were told at the Bagdogra airport that the Mumbai flight was cancelled but we were redirected through Calcutta. The flight to Mumbai from Calcutta was to leave at 8.15pm,” said Dalal. However, at 5.35pm that day, he received a call from the airline and was told that the flight had taken off almost three hours before the scheduled departure.The airline had arranged for hotel accommodation for the four persons on June 2 and had booked them on a SpiceJet flight the next day (Wednesday, June 3). However, after reaching the airport, Dalal came to know that the flight had been cancelled because of the cyclone.AirAsia rebooked them again on an IndiGo flight for Thursday afternoon, which they finally took.“We had to cancel flights to Mumbai because the airport was closed. The passengers were informed but there are serious network problems, for which many passengers are not receiving messages,” said an official of the airline.Other airlines also said they had to cancel flights because of the cyclone and change in quarantine rules in some states.Manipur has temporarily restricted flight movements from all parts of India because of Covid-19. Airlines said the state was allowing only three flights every day, forcing them to abruptly cancel flights.“We had to cancel our flights to Imphal because of the state government’s decision,” said an Air India official.An official of a private airline said because of changes in the quarantine rules, many passengers were cancelling bookings.“It’s not viable to operate a flight with only a handful of passengers,” said the official. After booking, passengers are being sent links related to the quarantine policy of the state they are to fly to. After booking a ticket, a passenger comes to know that he or she would be quarantined for seven to 14 days and would not be able to finish the work and so, is cancelling the ticket.“On an average, domestic flights in and out of Calcutta were having 50 to 60 per cent load, compared with almost 90 per cent before the pandemic,” the official said.",2020-04-06 22:29:00
246,Monalisa Chaudhuri,"In lockdown, a dog’s life for all - Telegraph India","When Ankit Gupta returned to his car after removing parts of a fallen roadside tree that were blocking his way, he had a shock waiting for him.His pet Labrador Shabby, whom he had taken along for a spin after she had been confined at home through the lockdown, had vanished.The canny canine had taken advantage of a half-rolled-down car window.Thus began a saga at 2pm on Wednesday — of befuddled dog, anguished family, kindly police and the long arm of social media — culminating in a reunion of pet and loved ones at midnight.It appears that nine-month-old Shabby could not find her way home even though she had jumped off the car in her own neighbourhood, Phoolbagan. Perhaps because she had not had a sniff of outdoors in the last two months.Cops found her loitering on the streets, took her to Phoolbagan police station and circulated her pictures on social media.All this while, Gupta, who runs a garment business, kept returning to the spot in his car. He did so five times between 2pm and 6pm, calling out to Shabby by her name, hoping to hear a familiar bark.At Gupta’s home, the youngest and most despondent member had already declared a hunger strike till Shabby returned.Shabby seems to have had a better time, quickly making friends with a stray dog, Katappa, who lives on the police station compound.“She (Shabby) had been confined to our flat, apart from occasional trips to the terrace, through the lockdown. So, while going out to buy essentials yesterday, I took her along in the car,” Gupta said on Thursday.“A part of an uprooted roadside tree had got entangled with my tyres. It took me around 15 minutes to clear the obstruction with my hands and return to my car. By then, Shabby was gone.”Around 7pm, the family spotted a tweet by the police saying a pet dog had been found loitering on the road.“I immediately went to the police station, which is less than 500 metres from our home. Shabby was comfortably ensconced in an AC chamber,” Gupta said.“The officers had taken good care of her. They had put a nice collar on her too.”The police asked for Shabby’s identity documents. Gupta went back home to collect her veterinary doctor’s prescriptions and her photographs with the family.The formalities took several hours to complete before he could take Shabby home – and only after he had correctly mentioned Shabby’s “identity mark”, a scar from a recent infection on the left side of her head.“The police checked Shabby’s vaccination charts, her last veterinary prescriptions and her pictures with us. I told the police about the scar on her head. Only then they handed her over,” Gupta said.The happiest in the family was Gupta’s two-and-a-half-year-old son Yug, who had not eaten a morsel since Shabby went missing.",2020-04-06 22:55:00
247,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus Lockdown: Many private buses off roads in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"At a bus stop in Mudiali on Thursday, Sunita Devi waited for nearly 35 minutes before she could board a bus.On other days, the woman from Bansdroni, who works part-time at a company, would have had to wait for over 55 minutes, she said. Throughout Calcutta, commuters had to put up with a frustrating wait as only a handful of private buses and minibuses rolled out despite the unions agreeing to resume normality from Thursday.The situation, however, was slightly better during the day because only government buses were on the roads till Wednesday.Around 700 of the 9,000-odd private buses in the city and its adjoining areas were on the roads on Thursday, transport department officials said. Bus union leaders said most of the vehicles were not fit to be on the roads because of lack of maintenance for more than two months, since the lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus had started.And to make matters worse, several workers refused to resume duty fearing ostracisation once they returned home, mostly to suburbs in North and South 24-Parganas, the leaders said.Buses on some routes — including Barasat-Botanical Garden, Belghoria-Golf Green, Lake Town-Kalikapur and Metiabruz-Shyambazar — were only a third of their full fleet strength on the roads.On some routes — for instance, Howrah Maidan-Salt Lake — vehicles started showing snags as they prepared to roll out, forcing the owners to decide against running buses on Thursday.“It is unlikely that there would be a sea change in a day and all private buses would start plying immediately,” said Rahul Chatterjee, of the Bus Minibus Samanay Samity. “Getting staff to resume their duty will remain a challenge.” A section of bus owners said they would rather wait for the government to increase fares before rolling out buses. “It costs around Rs 5,000 to fix a snag. Where will we get this money from?” asked the owner of a bus on route 214A, which plies between Sajiarhat in Madhyamgram and Babughat.“Now, a bus owner doesn’t even get Rs 500 after paying his staff their dues. So what’s the point?”Others said if their staff were willing, they would run a few trips in the morning and evening and save on the fuel in the afternoon.“Private bus owners should have clearly said they needed a day or two before they could resume their services,” said Pritam Das, who was spotted waiting for a bus near KC Das in Esplanade. “I have been waiting for a bus to Barrackpore for over half an hour now and there aren’t any.”Transport department officials began distributing masks and sanitisers to bus owners to help staff overcome the fear of contracting the coronavirus. Over 1,000 masks, sanitiser bottles and face shields were distributed on Thursday. While private buses were a few, state-run buses were visible in greater numbers on Thursday than on other days.  Transport department officials said more AC buses and battery-run buses were put into service to fill the demand-supply gap. “We have decided to withdraw state buses from the duty of ferrying health department officials and replace them with hired private buses,” said a transport department official. “This will add another 150-200 buses to our fleet.”",2020-04-06 23:29:00

By the time he returned home early on Thursday, doctors at the surgery ward had started preparing Montu Sarkar from Amtala, in South 24-Parganas, for the operation.On Thursday afternoon, surgeons stepped out of the operating theatre and informed Montu's family members that the procedure had been successful.Nilkantha, who works in the back office as a member of the sales team of a hosiery group in Sector V, knew he had to respond when a call came from SSKM’s blood bank on Wednesday night.There was a strong stirring inside and he had to go, Covid pandemic notwithstanding. Around 10pm, he called one of his neighbours and rode pillion on his two-wheeler to the hospital.“Since this is a rare blood group, whenever someone requires it, I know what it means. Manusher rokto ta dorkar. (The man requires blood). Er beshi aami kichhu jani ni. (I didn’t know anything beyond this),” Nilkantha said.“I did not have to donate blood earlier during the pandemic. But if it was required, I wouldn’t have hesitated.”Nilkantha’s words offer hope for state-run blood banks across Calcutta that are battling a shortage. The blood bank at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, for instance, has 40 per cent less stock compared with the demand.“People are afraid to turn up at blood donation camps because of the Covid-19 pandemic. We are trying nevertheless,” an official of the blood bank said on Thursday. At the SSKM blood bank, the daily requirement is around 350 units. At a donation camp held around two weeks back, a team from the hospital had collected 260 units.“The Bombay blood group is a rarity and people like Nilkantha stand out during these times with their gestures,” said an official at the SSKM blood bank. “We wanted to send him a car at his home. But he refused saying that would mean loss of precious time.”Montu’s family is thankful to Nilkantha for his priceless contribution to the effort to save a part of the left leg of the businessman. The rest of the leg had to be amputated as a part of a pillar of his rented office space in Amtala collapsed.Montu runs a small factory that manufactures mineral water. On July 28, a part of the pillar came crashing down, leaving Montu with gashes on his head and a severely damaged left leg.“He received 23 stitches on his head,” said Biswajit Pal, one of his family members. “Two other persons had donated blood. But Nilkantha’s donation ensured that the surgery could take place.”",2020-04-09 01:45:00
249,"Mita Mukherjee, Tapas Ghosh",Supreme Court reprieve for minority schools - Telegraph India,"Six minority schools in Calcutta can approach Calcutta High Court for a “recall/modification” of the court’s order asking a two-member committee to go through their income and expenditure details, the Supreme Court said on Thursday.Until an order is passed on the application of the petitioners, the high court order will be kept in abeyance, the Supreme Court said.The high court formed the two-member committee after parents of students of 121 private schools sought a fee waiver. They had said they found it difficult to clear the dues because of financial crisis during the pandemic.Six Christian missionary schools run by the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) had moved a special leave petition before the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.The church decided to move the petition because minority schools enjoy financial autonomy to run their schools, a CNI official said. This freedom to minority schools is guaranteed by Article 30 of the Constitution.  “The direction to submit the audited books of accounts with income/expenditure statements of the schools causes grave hardship and prejudice to the minority rights of the petitioners who are private unaided minority schools managed and controlled exclusively by the Diocese of Calcutta, Church of North India,” the petition in the apex court read.A special bench of Justice Ahoke Bhusan, Justice R. Subhash Reddy and Justice M.R. Shah of the Supreme Court on Saturday allowed the special leave petition and gave the six schools the liberty to make a fresh application before Calcutta High Court.The apex court was “of the view that looking into the issues, which are involved in the writ petition, the high court may decide all issues at an early date”.The six schools that moved the special leave petition are the two La Martiniere schools, St James’, Pratt Memorial, St John’s Diocesan Girls’ Higher Secondary School and St Thomas’ Church School Howrah.Some of these schools had offered 25 per cent relief on computer fees, sports and games fees and library fees from April to September. The La Martiniere schools do not charge separate fees for computer, library or sports but they form part of the tuition fees charged every quarter.Parents whose children are in the La Martiniere schools could not say if they had received any waiver at all.On July 18, a division bench of the high court, headed by Justice Sanjib Banerjee, had set up the two-member committee to examine the income and expenditure details of the 121 private schools while hearing a public interest litigation.The bench had asked the committee to submit a report to the court after going through the details.The two members of the committee are Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, and Gopa Dutta, the former vice-chancellor of Gourbanga University.The court had asked the committee to examine the expense and income details of the schools to find out if the institutions had faced any financial difficulty as many guardians were reluctant to pay the fees during the lockdown.The committee can seek the help of chartered accountants for the accounting job, the court had said.",2020-04-09 01:51:00
250,Sanjay Mandal,Calcutta airport chaos shifts gates - Telegraph India,"The airport had on Tuesday witnessed congestion at the entry to the terminal and security check counters. On Thursday, the congestion shifted to gate 3C, in front of the ticket counters of various airlines.The airport authorities and airlines deployed additional personnel at the entrances and extra scanning equipment at the security check counters to clear the rush on the second day flights operated between Calcutta and six other Indian cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, since resumption on September 1.Hundreds of passengers on Thursday were found not carrying smartphones or the necessary app and travel documents on their smartphones. These passengers were then redirected to gate number 3C at the departure level of the terminal building, where the airlines have their ticket counters.“These passengers, all first-time fliers, were taken to gate 3C, where airlines helped them with the documents. Those who did not have smartphones and so could not download Aarogya Setu app were given self-declaration forms on their health conditions. Others were helped by airline staff to get web check-in done,” said an official of a private airline.It was taking nearly an hour on an average for most passengers to complete the formalities.“On Tuesday, there was a crowd build-up outside the entry gates. On Thursday, the crowd shifted to gate 3C. Those who had all the documents entered the terminal without any hassle on Thursday,” said the official.On Tuesday, hundreds of passengers missed flights and several flights were delayed because of lack of passengers. Many had blamed the chaos on lack of preparedness on the part of the airport authorities despite the number of departing flights jumping from 60 to 92.Asked about the congestion, an airport official had said on Tuesday: “A large number of the passengers who had booked tickets on resumed flights are first-time fliers. They did not have required documents or apps and that led to congestions at the entrance.”Flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur had been suspended on July 6, following a request from the Bengal government, because of high Covid prevalence there. The flights resumed on Tuesday.Till September 14, the flights will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Later, they will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.After Tuesday’s chaos, officials of the airport and airlines conducted a survey on Wednesday to find out possible solutions.As part of the plan, it was decided that airline employees and security personnel would identify first-time passengers and help them. But that led to the congestion at gate 3C.“We have appealed to the airport authorities to allow these first-time fliers to show their tickets at the gate and enter the terminal. Inside, the airlines can assist them. Inside the terminal there is a lot of space. Because of the congestion at gate 3C, social distancing could not be maintained,” said a representative of the airline operators’ committee at the airport.“The airlines have verbally appealed to us (to relax the rule for first-time fliers). But because this is against the safety norms laid down by the Centre, we need a formal application from them. We will then consider it on humanitarian grounds,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.The congestion was much less at the security check-in area on Thursday because of additional equipment to scan hand baggage, Bhattacharya said.The number of X-ray counters with faster automatic tray retrieval system was increased from two till Wednesday to four on Thursday.",2020-04-09 01:52:00

Earlier such housing complexes could pay Rs 40 lakh… a sort of compensation… if they failed to provide space for a station,” a CMC official said.Debabrata Majumdar, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators who is in charge of solid waste management, said “the stations would be used to compact the waste generated by residents of the housing society as well as the neighbourhood”.But waste management specialists said compost units would have been better. Composting is a process to make fertiliser out of organic waste such as fruit and vegetable peels and cooked food waste. It helps in the recycling of waste and reduces the volume of waste going to landfills, according to waste management specialists.A compactor, on the other hand, only squeezes waste to make it more compact and reduces the volume of waste without recycling it.“Waste compactors only remove the problem from the streets… what is needed is more stress on recycling, for which waste segregation at source is necessary,” Brajesh Dubey, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Kharagpur who specialises in waste management practices, said.Running a composting unit will ensure that fruit and vegetable waste is turned into fertiliser and the civic body will need to pick up a small fraction of wastes produced in a housing complex.The CMC should have insisted on houses segregating waste into biodegradable (wet) and non-biodegradable (dry), Dubey said. “The solid waste management rules of 2016 speak about waste segregation at source; but compactors create a habit of anti-segregation among people.”If wet waste is segregated and put into a compost unit then there is hardly any need to compact dry waste, which mostly includes plastic products, papers and metals. These can be handed over to agencies that run plants to recycle such waste, a waste management specialist said.The state level environment impact assessment authority had in December notified the construction of a compost plant in projects with a built-up area of at least 200,000sq ft. The notification made it mandatory for the projects to “install onsite compost plant to treat biodegradable waste”.",2020-04-09 02:00:00
254,Subhankar Chowdhury,Stay-put advice for IIT Kharagpur staff - Telegraph India,"IIT Kharagpur has advised teachers and others who stay on the campus to refrain from moving out of the campus/city “considering the recent increase in the number of cases on the campus”.A notice issued by the registrar of the institute on Thursday seeks support from the faculty and other employees to keep the campus safe during the Covid-19 pandemic. The notice came on a day the number of Covid-positive cases on the campus climbed to 14.If any resident comes from outside, he or she will have to visit BC Roy Technology Hospital on the campus on arrival and mandatorily spend 14 days in home quarantine, the notice says.The first positive case on the campus was detected on August 19. Of the 14 confirmed cases, five are students of the institute. Among the rest are a teacher and her son, who are being treated at a private hospital in Calcutta.“The faculty, staff and others who are staying in the campus are strictly advised to refrain from the movement out of the campus/city considering the recent increase in the  number of cases in the campus. Your help and support may make our campus safe and secure from the COVID-19 pandemic,” the notice reads.Registrar B.N. Singh said the earlier order asking the students and research scholars to leave the campus and head for their hometowns would be in force.“The notice is applicable to those who are residents of the campus. The handful of students who are staying at the hostels have to leave for their hometowns,” Singh told Metro.The students had been asked to leave the campus by August 30. The institute snapped Internet connection to the hostels on Tuesday evening to force those who could not comply with the deadline to leave.An official of the institute said the notice had made a distinction between residents of the campus and the students because residents have to move in and out of the campus for various reasons.“Many of our teachers and other employees often have to visit Calcutta or other places to meet their parents orother relatives. Many visit various markets in the town outside the campus to buy stuff. Such movements are not advisable now,” the official said.Residents are allowed to visit the market on the campus.",2020-04-09 02:02:00
255,Snehal Sengupta,Tiger attack in Sunderbans - Telegraph India,"A man who had ventured deep inside the Sunderbans to catch crabs and fish died after being mauled by a tiger on Thursday morning.Ram Raptan had set out on a small boat with several others from Kumirmari island, a forest department official said.The Indian portion of the Sunderbans encompasses an area of 9,600 square km, comprising 102 islands.Of these, 54 islands — including Kumirmari, which derives its name from the word kumir (Bengali for crocodile) — have human settlements.The rest are thick mangrove forests, home to the Royal Bengal tiger.According to the forest department official, the tiger attacked Raptan from behind inside the Jhila forest.Before the other men could realise what was happening, the animal had dragged him away.The tiger tried to drag Raptan deeper into the forest when some of the men managed to hit it with axes and sticks. “The tiger then let go of Raptan and went away,” said the forest official.Forest minister Rajib Banerjee said the men had ventured deep into the forest when the tiger attacked them. “The men told our officials that they had gone to catch fish,” Banerjee saidThe lockdown and Cyclone Amphan, which has left most fields and ponds in the Sunderbans inundated with saline water, have resulted in loss of livelihood for many people, according to foresters and people working for the welfare of those living in the Sunderbans.Even inexperienced groups have been venturing into the forests in search of a living, an official said.“Many migrant workers have returned to their villages after losing their usual means of livelihood during the lockdown. Several have fallen back on the forest and have taken to catching crabs and fish in order to make ends meet,” Sagnik Sengupta, a member of Stripes And Green Earth (SAGE), an NGO, said.Members of the NGO had visited several ranges in the Sunderbans to distribute relief materials in the aftermath of Amphan.At least 15 fishermen have already been killed in tiger attacks in the mangroves — two more than the number of persons killed in 2019.This is the official data, the actual number might be higher.",2020-04-09 02:06:00
256,Our Special Correspondent,Signal jump proves fatal for biker at Esplanade - Telegraph India,"A motorcyclist came under the wheels of a lorry after he jumped a traffic signal at the Dorina crossing in Esplanade and collided with a lorry moving towards Lenin Sarani on Wednesday, police said.The motorcyclist died on the spot. The person on the pillion escaped from being crushed under the lorry’s wheels as he was flung off the two-wheeler on impact and he landed a few metres from Lenin Sarani, the police said.Alauddin Laskar, 23, a resident of Rajabagan, and his friend Abul Jisan Mallick, 20, a resident of Nadial, were wearing helmets when the accident occurred minutes past midnight on Wednesday, a traffic police officer said.“It is clear from the CCTV footage of the area that vehicles on Central Avenue headed towards JL Nehru Road were not moving when the bike sped past them,” the officer said. “The lorry was headed towards Lenin Sarani from the Raj Bhavan end.”The motorcyclist saw the lorry to his right and accelerated in a bid to cross the stretch before the lorry but could not avert the collision, the officer said.“Both the vehicles were moving at high speed… it is clear that neither the lorry driver nor the motorcyclist could control their speed,” the officer said.Laskar came under the wheels, along with the motorcycle. Mallick got saved from being run over as he was flung off on impact, the officer said.Officers from New Market, Hare Street, and Bowbazar police stations went to the accident spot.They could not pull the mangled motocycle out from under the lorry and a crane had to be used to remove the mangled two-wheeler and Laskar.Laskar and Mallick were taken to SSKM Hospital where Laskar was declared dead, the police said.Mallick had to be admitted to the hospital.The driver of the lorry fled after the accident, the police said.A case of causing death by negligence, rash and negligent driving, causing grievous hurt by doing a rash and negligent act to endanger human life and causing mischief has been started against the driver.Laskar used to look after his family’s business of garments. He was headed home with Mallick when the accident occurred, the police said.",2020-04-09 02:13:00
257,Anasuya Basu,Cheaper isotope for PET-CT  - Telegraph India,"A medical isotope which plays a key role in cancer detection is now being produced on the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC) campus and supplied to hospitals at a price cheaper that market rates.The isotope — 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) — is used in a PET-CT scan. The commercial production and supply began in June, when most of the country was under lockdown. Earlier, hospitals and diagnostic centres had to purchase the isotope from private agencies.Ten hospitals in the city are procuring the isotope from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT), which is producing it on the VECC campus at Chakgaria, off EM Bypass. Among them are Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, AMRI Hospitals Dhakuria, Quadra Diagnostic Centre, North City Diagnostic Centre, HCG EKO Rajarhat, Spandan Diagnostic Centre on the NRS Medical College and Hospital campus, Netaji SC Bose Cancer Hospital and others.“We have been supplying 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uninterrupted through the lockdown to these hospitals,” said Sankha Chattopadhyay, scientific officer and head, BRIT, Calcutta.This was echoed by doctors and radiology-safety officers at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, Quadra Diagnostic Centre and HCG EKO Rajarhat, the hospitals that have since shifted their entire purchase of FDG to BRIT.“Earlier, we used to procure our supply from a private agency of a US-based company. But now we are shifting our purchase to BRIT because it is made in India and safety and quality are on a par with international standards. Besides, it is about 60 per cent cheaper,” said Debasis Chowdhury of Apollo.BRIT will also supply Gallium-68, another important isotope used specifically for breast and prostate cancer detection. Gallium-68 radioisotope has been successfully produced for the first time in India by VECC and BRIT recently. “We will soon be supplying Gallium-68 to the city hospitals too,” said Chattopadhyay.The medical cyclotron that was purchased from Belgium was set up and made operational by VECC scientists and engineers.",2020-04-09 02:42:00
258,Debraj Mitra,Metro date expected after Friday meeting - Telegraph India,"A meeting between officials of Metro Railway and the state government on Thursday could not finalise the date of resumption of commercial services.A date and other modalities are likely to be announced after another round of meeting on Friday, said state government and Metro officials. “Today’s meeting was positive. The state government has assured us of all help. But some operational modalities are yet to be finalised,” said a Metro official.The state government has requested Metro Railway to run trains on September 13 for NEET aspirants, said the official. “A similar request has also come from Delhi. If commercial services do not resume until September 13, we are likely to run at least some trains for students on that day,” the official said.The focus of Thursday’s meeting was social distancing and crowd control, the two key areas where Metro Railway needs the help of local police.“The idea is to ensure crowd management at the surface gates of stations which are the first entry points. Subsequent checks will be in place at the concourse and on the platform but controlling the crowd at the entry points will be crucial,” said Indrani Banerjee, Metro spokesperson.Once the number of passengers is controlled at the main entrance, the job of managing them at the concourse and on the platform will automatically be easier, said Metro officials. “The RPF can keep a check on passengers on the platform or train but we need the help of the police at the main gates,” said an official.The Unlock 4 guidelines of the Union home ministry had given a green signal for “graded” resumption of Metro services from September 7. The state government had said Metro trains can run in Calcutta from September 8. The entire state will be under lockdown on September 7.The proposals discussed at Thursday’s meeting included keeping only a couple of gates open at every station (one for entry and one for exit) and allowing only a fixed number of people on each train, said another official.The proposals are in alignment with the standard operating procedures announced by the Union urban affairs ministry on Wednesday and a protocol released by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation on Thursday.A section of Metro officials in Calcutta said each train “should not carry more than 400-450 passengers”. The normal seating capacity of an eight-coach Metro train is around 400.The state government’s team included the home secretary, transport secretary and the Calcutta police commissioner. Metro Railway was represented at Thursday’s meeting by the assistant general manager, chief operations manager and the chief security commissioner.",2020-04-09 02:57:00
259,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Brands move to customers’ doorsteps - Telegraph India,"Retail chains and apparel brands have started holding one or two-day camps to showcase their collections in housing complexes across the city at a time most of their potential customers are scared to step out and visit stores because of the Covid pandemic.Brands like Bata, Pantaloons, Max and Lifestyle have initiated this marketing strategy to reach out to their customers instead of waiting for their customers to reach them.Officials of Bata India Limited said they had covered over the past three weeks around 30 housing complexes, including Upohar Condoville on the EM Bypass and Siddha Pines in Rajarhat, to make up for the loss incurred during the lockdown.“Children’s shoes, slippers and walking shoes were most in demand. Many parents brought their children whose feet have outgrown their shoes. They have been delaying the purchase because of the fear of going to the store,” said Subhasish Chatterjee, senior district manager (retail), Bata India.The company has been fixing sales targets for the teams that organise the events based on the number of flats and their occupancy in a particular complex, Chatterjee said.“It may not be equivalent to the normal sale we have, but this revenue model is definitely more profitable than sitting idle in the stores and waiting for customers. People are more comfortable when we are going to their doorsteps,” he said.The companies are setting up temporary tents or hiring community halls in the housing complexes to display their products to the residents.All lifestyle stores — including apparels, shoes, cosmetics and leather goods — were closed during the lockdown from March andstarted to reopen only with the Unlock that started in June in a phased manner. However, the footfall across the city stores had been negligible.Officials of Pantaloons (Kankurgachi outlet) said they had started approaching the big housing complexes in the city to boost their sales in the run up to Durga Puja.“We have held a three-day event in five housing complexes till now. Talks are on in a few more complexes,” said Shyamdip Paul, deputy store manager, Pantaloons (Kankurgachi).Paul said they had been maintaining all social distancing norms and also ensuring that no one without a mask was allowed inside the shopping venue. Potential shoppers are being asked to maintain a queue if the number of people in the venue is crossing 20.For several Calcuttans, the chance to shop at their doorsteps has come as a relief after a gap of four months.“I am not comfortable with online shopping. Although my daughter (who lives abroad) had booked a pair of Sketchers for my morning walk, there was an issue with the size and I had to return them. I was so happy to see shoes being sold inside our housing. I could try and purchase one, finally,” said Gopal Mukherjee, who was one of the Bata customers at a south Calcutta housing complex in August.From apparel brands to laptop companies — several have replicated this model.“Initially, bank ATMs, frozen fish and meat carts were coming to our housing. But now even laptop repairs are happening at our doorsteps. The other day, Lenovo (a computer brand) came up with a stall in our housing complex where I could get my old laptop repaired,” said Anirban Bhattacharya, an IT professional who had been working from home over the past few months.However, housing complexes like South City have not been able to allow any of these vendors inside because of their association rules.“We cannot organise any commercial activity in the complex other than for essential commodities. Hence, we are not considering these offers when vendors are approaching us,” said an official of the South City Residents’ Welfare Association.",2020-04-09 03:00:00
260,Brinda Sarkar,Name of the road - Telegraph India,"The road along Kestopur Canal, between AB and AD blocks, may be named Barnaparichay Rasta, if the corporation has its way. The naming of the road was ratified at a meeting of mayoral council members of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.According to civic sources, besides renaming the road Barnaparichay Rasta they would install motifs of Bengali alphabets and popular characters from Sukumar Roy’s Abol Tabol along the stretch.“We thought of giving a road in Salt Lake a name as it would help people identify it. None of the roads in Salt Lake have names and it gets difficult for outsiders to navigate or drive inside the township,” said mayor Krishna Chakraborty.She did not explain why the AB to AD Block stretch was chosen when the road stretches from AA to SA Blocks. Nor did she explain why the name was selected.Barnaparichay, of course, is the path-breaking 1855 book by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar introducing learners to the Bengali alphabet. September 26 this year would mark the 200th birth anniversary of the educationist and social reformer.Streets in the township are formally known as Avenues and Crossroads — first, second and so forth — they are hardly used by residents. First Avenue would more likely be known as the street from PNB Island to Tank 8, for instance.After coming to power in 2010, the Trinamul-run civic board had wanted to name streets after eminent personalities but the Opposition had pointed out that the major roads in Salt Lake were maintained by the urban development department and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and that the civic body maintains only roads inside the blocks. The project died a natural death. The Telegraph Salt Lake had reported the issue on July 9, 2010.The AB to AD Block stretch is rather green. While one side has homes the other has the Green Verge, followed by the canal and then VIP Road.Grass on the AB Block side of the Green Verge could be trimmed shorter but overall the stretch is reasonably well-maintained. “People used to come here for morning and evening walks but we’ve kept it under lock and key during the lockdown,” said the guard at the AD Block portion of the park. “A side entrance is open only to allow people to use the municipal tap inside.”Some sections of the fence are broken and others have wild growth through them, intertwined with cables overhead. Two vats, however, ruin the view. The one at AB Block was almost empty but some trash lay outside on the road. The vat at AD Block had a lot of branches and leaves spilling out onto the road. While the vat itself was hardly full, the garden waste had covered more than one flank of the road outside.An empty plot at the beginning of AB Block even has a few hutments built on it and if one is lucky, one can spot the beautiful VIP Road flyover on the other side of the road through the trees in the verge here.The junctions of AB-AC blocks as well as of AC-AD blocks have tea shops and rickshaw stands. The state of the road is better than many around the township at the moment.Abhisek Chakrabarti, a resident of AC Block, is tired of telling people he lives “on the khal dhaar”. “People associate the canal with mosquitoes and get a negative first impression of my home,” he says. “Every lane outside Salt Lake has a name and I welcome the idea of having a respectable name for where I live too. It would be easier to give directions to visitors.”Pallabi Maiti, an entrepreneur, too feels the road deserves a better name than “khal paar”. “It’s a good idea but maybe a shorter name would be suitable. Also, Barnaparichay would be a tongue twister for residents who are not Bengalis. Domestic helps and security guards would hardly be able to remember such a long name too,” says the AD Block resident.AD Block’s Saumitra Maiti agrees. “No one understands names like First Avenue and Second Crossroad. Barnaparichay sounds secular and apolitical. But a name should have a link with the road. It’s only names like Mahatma Gandhi Road and Netaji Subhas Road that can be assigned to any street anywhere in the country. So why suddenly Barnaparichay?” Riju Roy, a resident of AD Block, feels the colloquial name “canal side road” is descriptive and functional. “The way renaming Tollygunge Metro station as Mahanayak Utam Kumar led to confusion, so will this. It will be years, if not a generation before people call it Barnaparichay road,” says the IT sector employee. “If it must be renamed, it should be something related to trees, given how green the stretch is.”Another AD Block resident proposes the stretch be called Bhaba Sarani since the Variable Energy Cyclotronic Centre under Homi Bhabha National Institute, is located here. “Besides, I doubt the chief minister will allow such a move. Some years ago water tanks of the township were named but each of them was, not one. They should do the same with roads — all or none,” he says.  “In any case, the major roads of the township are under the CMDA. It is they who can rename the roads and not the corporation.”Others could not care less. “A road by any other name would be just as bad,” AD Block’s Swapan Kumar Brahma shakes his head. “They dig it up to lay cables and move on without covering the ditch. The footpaths have paver blocks but they are so slippery after the rains that no one dares walk on them. Amphan debris are still lying about, residents dump their trash, the statues are cleaned only on the eve of occasions…Will a name change all that?” he wonders.Roy mentions how the new Bailey bridge of AE Block now brings in added traffic to the canal side road. ""The road is getting congested and needs better traffic management,"" he says.Brahma wonders if the christening would have any functional use. Our Islands have statues of personalities now but we continue to call them by their older established names like Island no 3 and 4.Anita Banerjee, also of AD Block, says she doesn't mind a name as long as the street is maintained. ""It would be nice to see the jungle outside cleared even if the pujas aren't around the corner. The footpath on the canal side of the street aren't cleaned either,"" she says.Her fear however is different. As it is we are driven up the wall submitting our KYCs and linking our Adhar cards with various accounts. I don't have the energy now to change my address to Barnaparichay Road on all my documents,"" says Banerjee.Additional reporting by Snehal Sengupta  ",2020-04-09 03:23:00
261,Brinda Sarkar,Platinum rating for New Town - Telegraph India,"Two years after it won gold certification for being a green city, New Town has achieved platinum — the highest level of certification awarded by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC).The IGBC is a part of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Formed in 2001, it rates cities as well as buildings, schools, healthcare centres etc on their eco-friendly quotient and had in September 2018 had conferred on New Town a gold certification - the second highest level after platinum. The news was reported in The Telegraph Salt Lake on September 25, 2018.Since the authorities have worked to fill up the lacuna and improve their standing.“We had applied for the certification last year and they began a series of reviews, making observations and recommendations for us to implement. It all happened before the lockdown,” said  Debashis Sen, chairman cum managing director of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) and chairman of New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA). Sen last week presented a copy of the certificate to state urban development minister Firhad Hakim.The authorities have worked on pushing new buildings to adopt rainwater harvesting and they are building infrastructure for cycle lanes and electric vehicles. “Parking lots are now required to reserve two per cent space for electric vehicles, we have entered a public-private partnership with a group called EESL (Energy Efficiency Services Limited) whereby they set up and operate e-vehicle charging units at eight places in New Town while paying Hidco a percentage. The project has been successful and they have asked for two more plots for stations,” said Sen.They have also worked to make their pavements wheelchair-friendly and they are developing India’s first Sensory Park for differently-abled children.New Town also scored well due to its waste management and segregation system and the upcoming eco-friendly modes of transport like the Metro and monorail.The only other cities to have received platinum certification from IGBC so far are Chennai, Amravati in Maharashtra and Rajkot and Dholera in Gujarat. The certification is valid for five years. “The platinum certification is the Everest of mountains. There’s no higher peak to scale,” says Sen. “But we shall continue to improve on our practices,”  promised Sen.saltlake@abpmail.com ",2020-04-09 03:25:00
262,Snehal Sengupta,Theft bid reported at Karunamoyee - Telegraph India,"Two theft attempts on the same night in Karunamoyee’s E Block has left residents jittery. The incidents happened on the night of August 31.  Around midnight on Monday, corporate trainer Neena A. Ghosh Roy heard a noise and got up to investigate. Ghosh stays in a flat where construction of new rooms is nearing completion. The family has put internal construction on hold due to the pandemic and no lights have been installed in the newly-constructed rooms.“Although it was dark, I could see that one of the windows of the room facing the elevator shaft was open and a man was peering inside. I immediately started shouting and he disappeared,” said Ghosh.Alerted by her screams, Ghosh’s husband called the police. When the cops arrived, they found a couple of slippers near the landing of the elevator shaft. “In all likelihood the man had climbed up the bamboo scaffolding put in place to facilitate the construction work,” said an officer of the Bidhannagar East police station.Sometime later on the same night, in another E Block building, Sanghamitra Mukherjee, 69, heard a rustling sound coming from outside her bedroom.“As soon as I heard the sound, I woke up and walked out. The construction of a new wing along with an elevator is on at our building and I saw that somebody was pulling out the sheets of plastic sheets covering the scaffolding. I raised an alarm but the person ran away,” said Mukherjee, a former principal of Lady Brabourne College.She said that they were living in fear as her family resides in a ground floor flat and the area around their building has plunged into darkness since cyclone Amphan damaged the streetlights.The police are probing both cases but have not been able to ascertain if it was the same person behind both.Several residents said that police patrolling inside the complex was extremely lax. “There is a police barrack on top of the Karunamoyee Municipal Market but the cops only park their vehicles and reside there. There is no patrolling at all,” said a resident who did not wish to be named.Mukherjee, on the other hand, pointed out that the large housing complex is devoid of security guards. “Most buildings here are getting new wings built but there are no security guards. There are absolutely no checks in place,” said Mukherjee.Another resident said they had to let go of guards as very few residents had agreed to pay for their services. “In the absence of private security guards, groups of young men often park their cars and two-wheelers inside the complex to drink and smoke,” he said. “We cannot protest as we are aged and we don't want to risk any trouble.”An officer of the Bidhannagar Commissionerate promised to increase patrolling inside the complex. ",2020-04-09 14:39:00
263,Sudeshna Banerjee,BE Block holds Covid Q&A session online - Telegraph India,"How to handle vegetables that come straight from the market? Does one need to wear a mask while walking in the park? How to disinfect a house?Such many and various questions came up at the webinar organised by BE Block Nagarik Sangha on Saturday. Facing the questions was Sibabrata Banerjee, internal medicine and critical care physician of Fortis Hospital.Banerjee started off stressing on the essential practices — wearing masks, social distancing and frequent washing of hands. “This is an unknown virus. It has already mutated 11 times across countries and climates,” he said.Explaining how its presentation was varying across geographical regions, he said doctors initially were screening for fever as that was the dominant symptom in the West. “But later we realised that most people here, who were later being found to be Covid-19 positive, were coming initially with diarrhoea.”The initial exposure was putting medical practitioners at risk. “There have been situations when a patient has entered my chamber without a mask when I was sitting wearing only an N95 mask (not complete personal protective equipment). I could not scold them,” he said, adding a grim statistic — already 264 doctors have succumbed to Covid across the country. “I am treating Covid patients so I may get infected any day. If I have stayed safe so far, it is only by following the basic safety guidelines.”But while stressing on social distancing, he pointed to the need for social bonding. He shared how panic was making people behave irrationally and insensitively. “An acquaintance, who tested positive, contacted me for a hospital bed which I arranged for. But once she realised that I was treating Covid patients, after getting cured, she called my wife to ask why I was coming home from the hospital!”Though one hardly ever knows when one gets infected, symptoms, he said, usually start appearing from the third or fourth day. “As for those who are being treated at home with mild or no symptoms, a person usually remains capable of infecting others for 10 more days starting from that day. The first Covid-19 detection test should be done on the fourth or fifth day. “The later half of the discussion was interactive, with residents seeking answers to questions related to the pandemic. (see box) The doctor suggested keeping the government helpline 180031344422 and the local police station contact number at hand. “If you need government help, the police arranges for an ambulance.”His parting advice was not to keep patients aged over 65 years with comorbidities at home unless a doctor specifically allows home treatment with a nurse in attendance.How to handle vegetables and other things that come straight from the market?Vegetables, fish or meat do not transmit the virus. So cleaning them normally should be adequate. Printed materials like newspapers are also not known to be transmitters. Currency notes could be a risk and should be handled with care.

Is it safe to order home-delivered food?Cooked food does not contain the virus but the container in which it is delivered might. So instead of putting the container in the microwave to heat, it is better to put on disposable gloves, take out the food immediately, keep it in utensils and dispose of the container as soon as it arrives along with the gloves.  

What should be the hygiene protocol to follow for caregivers coming from outside?He or she should have a separate toilet where he or she should go directly on entering the house. The person should wash his hands and change out of the outside dress and into a set of washed clothes left for him in the toilet. Before leaving, the person should wash the dress and leave it to dry. Since mornings are often cloudy, it is better to keep two sets of clothes in the toilet for the person to use in case the first set does not dry adequately the day after.

How to disinfect the inside of the house?Two chemical solutions are being used — sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide. You can buy a can used to spray insecticides from a nursery and use it. But spraying hypochlorite will ruin your furniture and wall paint. The buttons of our hospital lifts have lost the digits due to regular spraying. Hydrogen peroxide is slightly better that way. But can you sanitise everything every time? The best remedy is washing hands with soap and water.",2020-04-09 14:39:00
264,Sudeshna Banerjee,Plasma donation camp for Covid-free - Telegraph India,"A blood donation camp will be held with Covid-19 survivors in New Town on Sunday morning. Organised by New Town Forum & News (NTFN), a local social welfare  organisation, and Cenergy, another non-governmental organisation, it will be held at the CB Block community hall. Organisers claim this will be the first such camp outside a hospital in the state which is aimed to help with plasma collection for Covid-19 treatment and research.“We were receiving many requests for plasma donors from friends and relatives of Covid-19 patients. That made us think of holding such a camp. In the meantime, the health department issued an order on August 24 to set up convalescent Covid-19 plasma banks in 20 state-run hospitals. That order also allowed collection from voluntary blood donation camps. So we sought permission from the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA),” said Samaresh Das, president of NTFN. The State Blood Transmission Control and the blood transfusion cell of the National Health Mission were then approached.
The organisers are contacting residents who have recovered from Covid-19 sufficiently early. “We are taking the cut-off date for eligibility to be 38 days from the day of the report coming positive. The other criterion is 28 days after the report coming negative. But now many are not going for a test after they recover,” Das added.Arindam Dutta Chowdhury, who has been a moving force behind the series of blood donation camps organised during the lockdown by the forum across New Town, explained that though the target is plasma collection, the team coming from SSKM Hospital will collect whole blood. “That way the other components can be put to other use, especially platelets which are needed for treatment of dengue, which is also being reported,” he added.",2020-04-09 15:14:00
265,Sudeshna Banerjee,Green dream spread over 12 cottahs - Telegraph India,"A dumpyard for construction materials with a store of bamboo poles. Ever since they shifted to New Town in 2017, this is the view that would greet Barun and Purabi Basu whenever they would step out of their apartment in AB Block. But thanks to their endeavour, the plot is now a green verge.Their inspiration was a stretch of Gobi Desert where billions of trees are being planted across 13 provinces since 1978 in China’s fight against expanding deserts. “When we were flying back from the US, I kept an eye on the flight path displayed on the screen in front of me. When it showed that we were over Gobi Desert, I looked down. I could surely spot greenery,” said Purabi. The thought inspired the 65-year-old lady. “If they could plant trees in a desert, why can’t we do so on this stretch, I wondered.”Earlier, the Basus used to stay in a garden villa in Baguiati. Then they went to Connecticut, US to visit their daughter. “On our return, we settled in New Town. So this view just across the street used to be an eyesore for us, more so as encroachments were coming up right along the empty stretch,” said Purabi.So she went off to the NKDA office one day to check the map of Street 93. “I put in a request to protect it from shanties. NKDA heeded my request and fenced off one-third of the stretch that was still empty. But the encroachers started drying their clothes and heavy blankets on the fence. Soon the fence broke.”Purabi would send pictures of the stretch regularly to NKDA and keep in touch with the officials. That is how the bamboo fencing got barbed iron wire on the top.“Even then, grass was growing wild inside. And a narrow canal adjoining the stretch, which is the northern boundary of New Town, had turned into a den for mosquito larvae.” At her entreaty, NKDA covered that with concrete slabs.Seeds of ambitionThe first tree was planted on July 12, 2019 in presence of a monk from Ramakrishna Saradashram and neighbours. The Basus bought 80 trees from the Tall Tree Nursery. “I wanted tall trees instead of saplings as they would help in cloud formation,” Purabi said. The couple footed the Rs 3,500 bill from their own pocket.The first lot of plantation fired their ambition. Some time later, they invested Rs 1,500 in 50 slightly more expensive trees.“The nursery gave us a hefty discount this time though the trees they gave us in the second lot are refusing to grow.”
Barun may be 77 years old but he is sprightly. “I still go on treks and avoid taking the lift in my building,” grins the man who can hardly stay seated at one place for long. Till recently, he used to run a free coaching centre on Sundays in the garage space of the apartment where children from underprivileged families, aged three to 14 years, came to study. The Sunday school ran from 9am to noon. In between classes, the children watered the trees.By then, their venture had become locally known and hands were extended in help. A local Rotary club sponsored some trees. A gardener brought 15 mahogany saplings. Volunteers of a residents’ forum gave five guava trees. Some neighbours too planted a couple of betel nut and sal trees.At one side of the 12 cottah stretch, there is a garage for NKDA germicide spraying vehicles. The garage had a water connection. The Basus requested for water to be drawn from there for the trees which was allowed.Even now, they walk into the stretch and inspect each twig for fungal infections and ant attacks.  “I want an orchard to grow here so that birds flock to peck on fruits and nest. Flowering trees would be a nuisance as people would try to climb over the fencing to steal flowers,” Purabi says. The stretch now houses about 120 trees of varied species — neem, banyan, ashwattha, mango, betel nut, chhatim, mahogany and krishnachura.“Somehow, spinach has also started growing here. Women from the shanties enter to pluck the leaves with our permission,” Purabi says.Though classes are suspended, Barun continues to work for the kids. “A neighbour from Utsa Luxury once celebrated his grandson’s birthday with them. Even after the lockdown, we have distributed milk and biscuits thrice among 300 children. We also collected old clothes from the neighbourhood and distributed among them,” he says.His next goal is Sunday breakfast meets for 20 kids. “We can accommodate that many, maintaining social distancing. We will explain to them how coronavirus is spreading and discuss lives of icons. That way they can stay in touch when their regular classes have stopped,” says Barun.Even as he nourishes the minds of young human saplings, his wife keeps an eye on the plot in front. “It feels nice to watch the greenery from the window on waking up. Wish more people offer to plant trees here,” Purabi smiles.",2020-04-09 15:40:00
266,Snehal Sengupta,Civic body plan for rapid coronavirus tests - Telegraph India,"The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has decided to increase the number of Covid-19 tests in all 41 wards.A mayoral council member said they are looking to procure rapid antigen test (RAT) kit and test residents focussing on areas like Duttabad, Teghoria, Kaikhali, Raghunthpur, Mongalganthi and several places of Rajarhat that are reporting a steady stream of cases.According to a health department official, the corporation has put in place two testing centres at the Bidhannagar Municipal Sports Academy in Central Park and at Rajarhat near Narayanpur but these are not adequate to conduct tests for the masses.Additionally, the Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital in DD Block has a walk-in swab collection kiosk. Samples from these three centres are being sent to various government-run hospitals that have laboratories equipped for testing.“So far, the councillors were either recommending or bringing specific people of their wards for testing. This has yielded little result as there is a sizeable section that doesn’t want to undergo tests for a variety of reasons. We have come across many people who have had symptoms of Covid but flatly refused to visit the testing centres,” said the official.He said reports often came late and that the time-lag was risky since the potential patient might step out of isolation in the meantime and increase the risk of the infection’s spread.This is one of the reasons the civic body is looking to conduct rapid antigen tests and is also planning to conduct random tests like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is doing. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had expressed her concern about the rising number of cases in North 24-Parganas some days ago.As per figures released by the health department, the number of cases in North 24-Parganas is 35,259 with 728 new cases as on September 1. There are three containment areas under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation — two in Duttabad and one in Deshbandhunagar, Baguiati.NKDA is already conducting free rapid antigen tests in New Town for shop-keepers, domestic helps and toto drivers who could be super spreaders.",2020-04-09 16:21:00
267,Swarbhanu Chatterjee,CE Block ode to spirit of women - Telegraph India,"The New Town CE Block Cultural Association celebrated the spirit of women in an all-woman extravaganza. The event was organised by the women of CE Block, for all women, with a view to provide expression against the various atrocities committed against the modern-day women and to celebrate the success of women in various fields.The guest of honour was retired judge Abha Khan who encouraged the women to maintain the trend and enthusiasm. The programme was hosted by Shobhona Roychowdhury and Madhumita Chatterjee, and was inaugurated by a chorus group from the same block. It was followed by a self-composed poem recitation by Satabdi Banerjee.“I like writing so the organsiers requested me to pen something down for the occasion. I wrote on the strength of women,” said Banerjee, a graphic designer. “The concept of equality hasn’t percolated down to everyone in society even in the 21st century. While my husband helps me a lot with chores I know of cases where the husband and wife both work but when it comes to chores, the woman alone is expected to perform them.”Nandita Chatterjee shared with the crowd some information about women achievers around the world and engineering student Srijonee Ghosh danced to the recitation of Ami shei meye by Bratati Bandyopadhyay. “I’ve danced at lots of functions before but this was my first time at an event dedicated to women. I chose this poem as the title is both intriguing and makes a direct connection with women.”There was a distinct effort made by men to ensure that the day belonged to the fair ladies to celebrate their independence.The crowd ranged from five-year-old Aaradhya Roy, to the extremely matured Jayoti Das, all of whom participated in their own way to enlighten the gathering.If you want to get a programme featured in this column, write in to The Telegraph Salt Lake, 6, Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta - 700001  or e-mail to saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-04-09 16:21:00
268,Brinda Sarkar,Dressed as first in their fields - Telegraph India,"As a child I wanted to become a pilot but it didn’t happen. Nonetheless, I got to look and feel like a pilot at a programme to pay tribute to women this year and it turned out to be next to the real thing,” smiled Priyanka Kejriwal, who had dressed up as Durba Banerjee, India’s first woman commercial pilot.Priyanka and eight other women celebrated their gender by dressing up as Indian women who were firsts in their field. The fun project was the brainchild of Namitha R. Dalmia, who runs Ssidhh Studio in Kankurgachhi. The programme took place before the pandemic stalled all activities.“I first picked the personalities I wanted to feature, studied their dressing styles and chose women from among my clients and friends to play them. I assigned them roles as per their figures as it would bear the closest resemblance,” said Namitha, a fashion designer.The participants had a ball. Whether it was AJ Block’s Suman Jhawar who felt all important draping the ghoonghat over her head like former president Pratibha Patil or Suddha Dalmia, who sat behind an autorickshaw wheel to pose as the country’s first lady auto driver Shila Dawre.“We had hired an auto for the shoot and, no, I didn’t try to drive it lest I also stage the first auto accident by a woman!” laughed the lady who had worn a green and yellow salwar to match the colour of autos in the city.Madhu Sureka, smartly turned out in jeans, shades and leather jacket, posed with an Enfield. “I play Roshni Sharma, the first lady biker to ride from Kanyakumari to Kashmir,” said Madhu, who confessed she had to Google Roshni to learn about her. “The lady had a point to prove. Riding was her passion and she didn’t let anyone stop her,” said the lady who runs a boutique. The bike, by the way, was borrowed from the photographer who was covering the event.Rekha Choudhary was flattered when told she would be playing the beautiful Sania Mirza. “My husband and I play tennis and I’ve watched Sania playing too. Her wardrobe, however, is nothing like mine and I had to borrow my daughter-in-law’s skirt to wear for the role. I couldn’t source a nose ring like Sania’s either and I finally resorted to jugaad by using a pin from a chandelier for the job,” laughed the resident of CD Block.To play Saina Nehwal, Sweety Agarwal took tips from her daughter, a district level badminton player. “It was great fun but next time if Namitha holds such a shoot, I would like to pose as Rhonda Byrne, author of my current favourite book The Secret,” said the lady who runs a furniture business.Priyanka jests that she had an upper hand at playing a pilot as she lives so close to the airport. “I can see the airport from my terrace at Ujwala Luxury Complex in New Town and we can hear flights taking off and landing all day. If I was a real pilot I would have travelled the entire world by now.”For those like Indra Choudary, the opportunity was one to live their dreams. “How else could I feel like I’m going to outer space?” asked the lady who played astronaut Kalpana Chawla. She wore an orange sweatshirt and draped a black dupatta in a way that resembled the NASA space suit and let her straight hair down to recreate the iconic picture of Chawla.“I played Anandi Joshi, one of the first lady doctors, and I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for her to fight for an education so many generations ago,” said Usha Saraf, a resident of AJ Block. “She remains a role model for women today.”Rekha does not have a daughter but says has asked her daughter-in-law to do everything she herself wanted and couldn’t.
Everyone wanted to know what Namitha, the brains behind this project, would dress up as. “They all thought I would save a beautiful princess-like personality for myself but I told them I’m like a mother to them all. So I dressed up as Mother Teresa.”",2020-04-09 16:22:00
269,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Muted Baisakhi celebrations amid coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"Baisakhi was celebrated across homes in the city on Monday and people offered prayers in their homes because they could not visit gurdwaras during the lockdown.A few committee members offered prayers, along with those who live there. “We prayed at home for the well-being of all… to fight this pandemic together. Baisakhi has a religious and cultural significance for the Sikh and Punjabi community… the day is observed as thanksgiving for abundant harvest and to seek blessings for future prosperity and progress,” Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, general secretary of the Behala Gurdwara, said.The gurdwara organised a langar on Monday like it has been doing during the lockdown to feed 3,500 underprivileged people, Ahluwalia said.Celebrations are a low-key affair this time, a member of the community said. “There is uncertainty and people cannot go to the market like they usually do to get fresh vegetables. But still families made some signature dishes.”“Only four or five members went to gurdwaras to offer prayers... We had cancelled the April 11-13 celebrations on the Maidan,” Satwant Singh, president of Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Calcutta, said.“Usually, there are 3,000 to 4,000 people at the gurdwara on Baisakhi and there are people from other communities as well. This year, we did not organise the langar,” Devinder Singh, president of Dunlop Gurdwara, said.",2020-04-13 21:49:00
270,Our Special Correspondent,Mukti World's London Paris multiplex screens up in flames - Telegraph India,"Two screens of London Paris multiplex in the Mukti World building in Ballygunge were gutted early on Monday. There were no casualties or injuries as there was no one in the building, police said.The fire had spread across the adjoining screens and gutted the seats, which were inflammable in nature, a fire officer said. It took three hours and 10 fire engines to douse the flames.“Thick fumes were spotted billowing out of the building in the morning. Our officers and fire officers rushed to the spot,” an officer of Gariahat police station said.Firefighters could enter into the building after the windowpanes were smashed and the trapped smoke was released, the police said.The fire brigade suspects a short circuit triggered the fire. Forensic officials will visit the spot and collect samples to ascertain the cause of the fire.“It will be the primary task of forensic officials to check if the main switch was switched on though the building was locked,' a fire officer said. “That will be crucial in determining the cause of the fire.”The building has several commercial establishments, including a banquet hall and restaurants and a jewellery store on the ground floor facing Ballygunge Phari. None of the other establishments were affected in the fire, the police said.Some police officers said if it were not for the lockdown someone would have spotted the fire sooner and alerted the fire brigade and the extent of the damage would have been less.",2020-04-13 21:50:00
271,Chandreyee Ghose,Coronavirus lockdown: Novel idea of online programme for Bengali New Year - Telegraph India,"A New Town neighbourhood and a school in Ajoynagar are celebrating Poila Baisakh online.Sudipta Guha, 55, who lives in New Town's AB block will wear her favourite red ikkat sari and perform an audio play and recite Shankha Ghosh’s Jamunaboti before an audience of nearly 100. Online rehearsals every evening for the past few days gave Guha and her neighbours something to look forward to during the lockdown. “All of us have shifted here recently. We have been planning our first independent Bengali new year celebrations since January. So when the lockdown was announced, we were heartbroken,” said Anik Chowdhury, the secretary of the AB Block Owners’ Association.But Chowdhury soon hit upon the idea of a virtual celebration. The programme would be held as planned, only it would be a Zoom meeting.“Most members are senior citizens They are missing their walks and addas. They are not tech-savvy but I helped many of them download the app and guided them,” said Chowdhury, a software engineer.Guha is definitely looking forward to Tuesday’s programme. “My son is in Mumbai and I worry for him all the time. I was getting depressed hearing the Covid-19 updates. I miss my walk, my gym too. I am looking forward to dressing up, performing and forgetting the reality for a while,” she said.It’s not only the elderly who are excited. Kosturi Sarkar, 25, can’t wait to put on her make-up and dress up for the occasion. “It’s been a month since I dressed up. That itself is a high. I plan to present a dance and I am enjoying this sudden adrenaline rush,” she said.Academic Somali Chakraborty has been taking virtual classes but on Tuesday she will go online for a different reason. “I am playing the synthesiser and am also part of a group performance. It is taking a lot of coordination,” the teacher at a south Calcutta college said.A city school, too, has decided to go online with its Navavarsha celebrations. Seven teachers and four students of Indus Valley World School have got together to present a 20-minute cultural programme to mark the Bengali New Year. All the performers have recorded their bits at home with Class XII student Rohosen Bhattacharya stringing them together. One presentation is a dance staged by three teachers of the school. “We recorded our respective performances at home, keeping one movement common,” dance teacher Ritwika Ghosh said.The director of the school, Amita Prasad, said the idea was to spread the message of hope and cheer. “The students keep asking me when school will reopen. We can sense their restlessness,,” she said.The video was coordinated by the dean of arts, Priyadarshinee Guha, who also oversaw the narration. “Editing the video took my mind off the stress.  Our future is uncertain now and that is making us restless,” said Bhattacharya, who appeared for the Class XII CBSE exams this year.The video link will be uploaded on the school app. There will also  be Facebook watch party.",2020-04-13 21:52:00
272,Our Special Correspondent,Grocery shop in Chitpore makes burglars’ list after essentials were robbed amid coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"A grocery shop in Chitpore has been burgled and packets of detergent powder and cartons of biscuits on the front rack were stolen.Essentials have become valuables, courtesy the lockdown imposed to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus.Grocery shops are allowed to stay open during the lockdown. The one in Chitpore that has been burgled was stocked with essential items such as rice, pulses, spices, soap, detergent powder and biscuits.When the owner turned up to open the shop at H/1 Dum Dum Road on Monday morning, he found the wooden door broken. Inside, a large quantity of essential items were missing.“The burglars had broken a side of the wooden door to enter the shop,” said an officer of Chitpore police station.The shop is located in a neighbourhood lined with commercial stores and residential buildings. Sources said police had not found any CCTV camera that covers the area of the alleged theft.People have been rushing to collect and store essentials since the lockdown started around three weeks ago so they have enough to feed their families for days and do not have to step out often. There are instances of families stocking up for an entire month.“Since grocery shops are open every day, people should not stock essential items in excessive amounts. That may create a crisis in the market and encourage blackmarketing,” said an officer at Lalbazar.“If there is a scarcity of a particular item in the market, it becomes easier to sell the product at a premium,” the officer said.Dry food such as cakes and biscuits have been on the priority list of many for stocking at home.Last week, a readymade garments shop in New Market, which has been closed since the lockdown started, was robbed of 30 pairs of jeans. Two men were arrested in connection with the theft.",2020-04-13 21:55:00
273,Sanjay Mandal,Airlines plan for social distancing after coronavirus lockdown ends - Telegraph India,"Keeping the middle seat of each three-seat row vacant, not assigning the last row to any passenger, allowing only one person to sit in each row in coaches that carry passengers to aircraft or terminal buildings...These are some of the measures airlines plan to take in the post-lockdown period to ensure fliers maintain social distancing as a safeguard against the coronavirus.But this could also end up burning a bigger hole in fliers’ pockets, officials of various airlines and tour operators said.It is not yet clear when domestic and international flights will resume even after the lockdown is lifted but airlines have started making plans for that, a key aspect of which is to ensure social distancing among passengers.SpiceJet on Monday released pictures of how passengers would be seated on coaches on their way to the aircraft or the terminal.“Social distancing. This will be the seating arrangement on SpiceJet coaches when operations resume. No passenger will sit on seats marked X. Standing space has also been earmarked,” read a statement issued by SpiceJet, referring to pictures the airline released.The stepladders also have similar X marks. One passenger would be allowed to board through the stepladder at a time. “This will be the new normal,” said an official of the airline. “These are initial plans which can be altered if the DGCA (directorate general of civil aviation) comes out with some rules,” said the official.Apart from keeping the middle seats of the aircraft vacant, SpiceJet is planning to keep the last row empty. “The last row will be reserved for emergency isolation,” the official said.Other airlines, too, are planning such moves. IndiGo is planning to operate with 50 per cent capacity. International airlines are also considering similar measures but waiting for instructions from the regulatory authorities. Aviation industry sources said some airlines were planning to stop serving meals on board.“When the flight operations resume, we are expecting very few passengers. Only those in emergency situations will fly. So, such social distancing measures would not be a problem,” said an official of an international airline based in the Gulf.However, social distancing would also mean more expensive tickets.“We are expecting a steep price hike because each flight would have less passengers but operation costs would remain almost the same,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.",2020-04-13 21:55:00

275,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus fighters unwanted in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Some technicians of a private hospital who shared a room in south Calcutta were asked by the landlord to move out because the hospital is treating Covid-19 patients.Another private hospital’s outsourced laundry stores are facing threats from residents of the respective areas who don't want the linens and other items to be cleaned there out of fear that those might spread the coronavirus.Health-care workers of government and private hospitals, even those who are not coming in contact with Covid-19 patients, are being ostracised in the city and elsewhere in Bengal. Officials of government and private hospital said the fear about coronavirus had become deep-rooted and they expressed the fear that such ostracism would continue.Public health experts and government officials feel this attitude of a section of society would leave health-care workers demoralised.Metro on Monday reported that many people, fearing ostracism and getting quarantined, are not going to hospitals even if they have primary symptoms of the coronavirus infection.Last week, state health department officials and members of the Covid-19 task force formed by chief minister Mamata Banerjee had faced protests from residents of Siliguri, who opposed the government’s decision to convert a private hospital of the Medica group into a treatment centre for patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI).“It’s not even a Covid-19 treatment centre but people would still not listen. Even local councillors joined the protests. In the face of the protests, we had to change the decision,” said a health department official.On Sunday, the government issued a notice announcing that another private hospital in Siliguri would be converted into a SARI treatment centre.“Many health-care workers, including doctors at several government hospitals, have told me they are being ostracised. Neighbours asked many of them to stay at their hospitals,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, a member of the task force. “Now is the time to show true patriotism and stand by the health-care workers who are treating coronavirus patients risking their lives.”Psychiatrists said the behaviour was expected. “This kind of reaction happens when an unknown disease surfaces. People used to ostracise HIV patients and it’s the same trend now,” said psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram.“Initially, people thought it would never attack them. Now that it is so close, there is panic and mass hysteria, which are aggravated by percolation of fake news about how the virus spreads.” Peerless Hospital has taken on rent rooms in hotels around the facility for its health-care providers. The primary clientele of these hotels were patients from Bangladesh and other states of India. “Now, these rooms are empty and we have taken them on rent,” said an official of the hospital.The AMRI Hospitals group is also facing similar problems and it had to file police complaints. “It was only after the police intervened that the problems were sorted out,” said an official of the group.",2020-04-13 21:56:00
276,Mita Mukherjee,Plea for home delivery of books amid coronavirus lockdown in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Booksellers supplying textbooks to ICSE and CBSE schools have urged the state government to allow them to deliver the books directly to students’ homes.Some booksellers said they already offer the option of buying books online and getting them delivered at home. But all of them would need the government’s permission for bulk doorstep delivery of books.“We need special permission from the government to deliver textbooks in bulk to students during the lockdown,” a bookseller said.At least three booksellers have written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, seeking permission for accepting home-delivery orders. Some others have appealed to school education department officials. “We are ready to take all necessary precautions recommended by the government and WHO,” the bookseller said.Students of most schools are yet to get books for the new class as the institutions had to shut down all of a sudden because of the lockdown.Booksellers usually set up counters on the school campus, where guardians can go and buy the books. Some suppliers sell books from their own outlets, too.Books for the new academic session were to be distributed at the La Martiniere schools on April 1 and 2.“But the schools can't allow us to open counters on the campuses now,” said a bookseller who supplies books to at least 20 ICSE and CBSE schools in Calcutta.   The schools were shut down on March 16 after the state government announced that all educational institutions would remain closed for the coronavirus outbreak.The schools will reopen on June 10. Several schools have started online classes to make up for the loss of classes and many more are preparing to start virtual teaching and learning sessions.Schools welcomed the booksellers’ proposal of delivering books to students as it would help them if they have the textbooks with them during online classes.Supriya Dhar, the secretary of the La Martiniere schools, said online classes will soon start and students will benefit if they get the books before that.“We have no problem if the bookseller can deliver the books at the students’ homes since it is not possible to distribute the books from the camus now,” Dhar said.",2020-04-13 21:56:00
277,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Kolkata private hospitals mull rate hike - Telegraph India,"Some private hospitals in Calcutta are planning to increase their charges beyond their annual rate revision because of a sharp dip in income following the coronavirus-related lockdown and mounting expenses, officials of several private health-care units said.A few want to wait and watch, while others are contemplating the quantum of hike in patient charges.Private health-care industry sources said hospitals would usually increase their charges by five to seven per cent annually to “cover inflation”.But this time many are mulling a 15 to 20 per cent increase in charges, including those of beds, investigations, surgeries and other procedures, and consumables, sources said.This, however, would not include the charges to be paid by patients admitted under various government health schemes, they said.Some hospitals are charging for personal protective equipment from patients to reduce expenses.The chairman of one private hospital has tweeted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi pleading for refund of outstanding income tax, while another hospital group has written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to speak to banks and financial institutions for soft loans for hospitals. Most hospitals in Calcutta are running at 30 to 35 per cent bed occupancy because of the lockdown. A large number of elective surgeries have been postponed and outpatient departments are all shut.The CEO of a private hospital in south Calcutta said if the situation did not improve by May, they would have to go for major borrowings and that would result in increase in charges. The bulk of patients at Calcutta’s private hospitals come from Bangladesh and Bhutan, as well as from districts of Bengal and other states of the country.Because of the lockdown, the flow of patients has stopped. It’s not clear when international flights or inter-state transport connectivity would resume even after the withdrawal of the lockdown.Private hospitals, however, said they had to maintain a minimum operational cost since the facilities were open.“Apart from the low occupancy rate, we have to pay huge amounts to buy personal protective equipment and N95 masks for health-care workers and doctors who are treating Covid-19 patients or those who have similar symptoms. The price of these gear has gone up by three to four times,” said Rupak Barua, the group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.He said the providers of these gear are refusing to allow credits because of high demands and low supplies. “So, we are telling the relatives of patients admitted with Covid-19 or symptoms of the disease to pay for these equipment additionally. Otherwise, the financial burden would be huge,” he said.Barua said the AMRI group had requested the chief minister to speak to banks and financial institutions for soft loans for hospitals. “Medica hospitals, largest chain in Eastern India is not able to pay salary, please pay outstanding income tax refunds of 17-18,” Medica Superspecialty Hospital chairman Alok Roy has twitted to the Prime Minister. He said there was no reply yet from the central government.All other hospitals have written to organisations such as the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI), Central Government Health Scheme and defence ministry to release dues that resulted from treating patients under these schemes.“Currently, our OPD numbers are at five per cent of our normal volume. Patients’ capacity to pay will also be majorly affected because of the economic crisis that will result from the Covid-19 pandemic,”  said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, of which the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences is the flagship unit.He said minimal activities were putting enormous strains on the finances. “We are requesting the governments to clear all dues under various schemes,” he said.",2020-04-13 22:02:00

Basu has been working with such women for more than two decades.“When we have access to the digital world why not make it available to them. If they have mental issues, counselling is an important aspect.”Similar sessions will be held once or twice a week. “Many are going through phases of feeling low and depressed and we think we need to support them with counselling,' Mudar Patherya, trustee of NGO Kolkata Gives that put the initiative together, said. Addressing the group was motivational trainer Soumitra Chatterjee whose organisation works with scientists, students and sportsmen. “Initially, the women were shy but gradually they opened up. They are in a vulnerable state and if they feel someone is compassionately listening to them they will be encouraged to speak out. We will help them come out mentally tougher through the session.'Chatterjee will design a module, which will include doing exercises and making lifestyle corrections. Patherya said the next step was to make the women digitally independent so that they could go online by themselves and do banking transactions online.",2020-04-14 20:29:00

Ninety-eight vehicles were seized from across the city on Tuesday. “Most of the violations on Tuesday were reported from the southern fringes of the city. Fewer violations were reported in central Calcutta,” an officer said. Unlike other years, there were no community celebrations for Poila Baisakh this year but several people stepped to go to the market, the police staid.Calcutta police have prosecuted more than 10,000 people till now for violating the lockdown.",2020-04-14 20:30:00
281,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Kolkata Gives helps home for kids with HIV - Telegraph India,"A home that takes care of HIV positive kids have run out of resources because regular contributors have stopped funding in the wake of the lockdown.But the home in Gobindapur in South 24-Parganas, Anandaghar, that supports 76 such kids has not stopped running because of some individuals from Kolkata Gives Foundation who have stepped forward with contributions.The Organisation for Friends Energies and Resources runs the home.Kallol Ghosh, the home secretary, said the private facility depended on contributions from individuals to take care of the kids. Apart from the HIV positive kids, the home has 150 children who are differently-abled.Ghosh, who founded the home in 1986, said they needed Rs 7.5 lakh a month to provide the children with food, education and regular health check-ups.The HIV positive kids require special attention as they are immunocompromised, he said. “We started feeling the pinch from March-end when regular donors stopped their contributions. People are now saving their resources to save themselves from the pandemic. In fact, no can be blamed for the panic reaction in this unforeseen scenario. But it has left us in the lurch,” Ghosh said.The extent of the crisis is so large that people who were unfazed by the demonetisation have now backed off, a home official said. “They kept contributing steadily then. But this time they have been forced to rethink.”The home generally approached companies for funds towards the end of March because donations get tax exemption, Ghosh, who has worked as a volunteer with the United Nations, said. 'But the situation is grim this time… companies are hardly responding.'As resources ran dry, the home contacted Kolkata Gives Foundation, a platform of donors. These donors are trying to help those struggling to collect resources during the lockdown.“We knew about the kind of work Kallol Ghosh has been doing over the years. So, when we got to know that he had run out of resources, our foundation chipped in to provide the essentials needed to feed the kids,” Mudar Patherya, one of trustees of the foundation, said. “We are helping labourers and the marginalised who have been out of work for weeks as well.Patheya has been associated with the foundation since its inception in 2014.Ghosh said he was “grateful” to the foundation for bailing him out. “But I am scared… what if the lockdown is carried forward. I am worried about the future of these kids.”",2020-04-14 20:31:00
283,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Stuck Kashmiris live on NGO help in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"More than 30 Kashmiri traders are stuck at Maheshtala on the city’s western outskirts, waiting to return home at the first chance after the lockdown is lifted.Their customers, mostly into stitching garments, cannot afford to clear their dues because their units are shut. So, the cash-strapped traders are living on free ration provided by local NGOs. “The lockdown happened suddenly. We had booked flight tickets for April 18. That is impossible now. But we hope that the curbs are lifted by April. We have no money to sustain ourselves any longer,” Farooq Ahmed, 39, said.The traders are living in five rented rooms in the Maheshtala area. “The rent has been paid up to April. I don’t have money to pay any more. If the landlord evicts us after that, I don’t know where to stay,” Yasen Bhat, 25, said.Last week, the traders got some dry ration — rice, potato and oil, from an NGO. “We had approached a local club that got us in touch with the NGO,” Bhat said.The men are cooking small portions every day to ensure the ration last long. The only solace is being able to talk to family members back home. “I want to go back. I will stay in quarantine and take every precaution but I need to go home,” Ahmed, who has been coming to the city for over a decade, said. “Returning home without money is also a problem. We bring stuff on credit,” another trader stuck in Maheshtala said.Many Kashmiri traders have returned, but the 32 stuck in Maheshtala, all from Budgam district, around 30km from Srinagar, are among those who could not. They had reached Calcutta between late October and early November to sell shawls and winter garments, a primary occupation of many residents in the valley. The traders usually start going back from early March.They sell their stuff to workers in the garment industry in Metiabruz and surrounding areas in South 24-Parganas like Maheshtala, Chakmir and Memanpur, around 16km from the heart of Calcutta.They sell on credit and get money in small installments when the workers get paid. All the production units are currently shut because of the lockdown. And the workers don’t have enough money to sustain themselves. Consequently, the Kashmiri traders are still to get their dues.",2020-04-14 20:31:00
285,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: Milk for north Calcutta kids on Nava Varsha - Telegraph India,"Children from financially weak families in a north Calcutta pocket received a glass of milk each on the first day of the Bengali New Year, while their mothers got to take home milk packets, vermicelli, sugar and biscuits to last a few days. The milk was bought from milk traders in  central and north Calcutta who have been incurring huge losses because most sweet shops, their biggest customers, are closed during the lockdown, sources said.The drive was aimed at helping both local milk traders and the children who have not been able to afford milk.The minister of state for women and child development and social welfare, Sashi Panja, handed over glasses of milk to over 60 underprivileged children in Gauri Shankar Lane.“Today’s day has a special significance. We have distributed milk, sugar, biscuits and vermicelli among mothers here so that they can cook payesh for their little ones on this special day. Because that is nutritional and healthy, too,” Panja said.Children from the neighbourhood were made to sit in chairs, maintain social distancing norms, and were offered a glass of milk each. Some milk traders, who depend on supplying milk to sweet shops, have been complaining about huge losses during the lockdown. “With most sweet shops closed, our business has taken a hit. We are also finding it difficult to transport milk because of multiple restrictions,” a milk trader in central Calcutta said.The government has allowed sweet shops to remain open for a few hours every day but shopowners have been complaining of huge losses.“This is directly affecting the milk industry,” the milk trader said.Several NGOs, individuals and police stations have come forward to distribute essential supplies, including atta, uncooked rice, pulses and dry food items during the lockdown.",2020-04-14 20:48:00
286,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Fish in Poila Baisakh lunch in JU's community kitchen  - Telegraph India,"Jadavpur University students who have been running a community kitchen to feed the poor donated a little extra so people living in shanties near Jadavpur railway station and under the Gariahat flyover could have fish in their Poila Baisakh lunch.These people have been surviving since the lockdown started on a meal comprising a bowl of rice and soybeans, delivered from the kitchen on the university campus. On Poila Baishakh (Bengali New Year Day), the students wanted to do something extra to bring smiles to the faces of the impoverished.A group of students, including research scholars, had set up the “Community Kitchen” in late March in the parking lot near gate No. 4 to feed the poor in neighbouring areas. They started with khichdi before switching to meals comprising rice and soyabean or egg.But on Monday, 300-odd people had something better — fish curry and mish-mash with fish heads — in lunch as part of an initiative to ring in Bengali New Year. “Amid the pandemic, we wanted to do something that could bring smiles to the faces of these people. The lockdown has robbed them of their livelihoods. We thought this would be the best way to cheer them up,” said Hindol Majumder, a research scholar.The students are running the “Community Kitchen” through crowdfunding. But for Monday’s menu they decided to spend from their pockets. “We started the initiative with our own resources. Then a corpus was created with generous contribution from the alumni and benevolent individuals. But we decided to fund Monday’s lunch from our pockets,” said Debjan Sengupta, another research scholar.Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Suranjan Das appreciated the gesture of the students amid the crisis. “Our students have always cared for the marginalised. The community kitchen has become a model for others to follow. I was touched with what they did on Poila Boisakh,” he said.The students said they would continue the initiative till June 10.",2020-04-14 20:49:00
288,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown: Baguiati stalls moved to unclog market - Telegraph India,"A least 160 temporary stalls have been shifted from their usual spots in the Baguiati market to a nearby fairground to control the huge crowds that would gather at the market in violation of social distancing norms.The market, in a narrow lane, was witnessing a huge footfall every morning as hundreds would converge to buy vegetables, fruits, chicken and fish, an official of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said. The 1-km stretch from the Baguiati bus stand on VIP Road till the Baguiati AC market would be clogged with shoppers. “It used to get so crowded that ensuring social distancing was not possible here,” said the official.  The owners of the stalls that have been shifted to the ground in Narayantala, around 900m from the  market, have been advised to set up their establishments at least three metres from each other. The authorities expressed the hope that since the fairground is at least 900m away from the market, many people would be dissuaded from making too many unnecessary visits to the stalls.Pranay Kumar Ray, the mayoral council member in charge of the health department of the civic body, said: “We have moved all the temporary stalls to the fairground to ensure social distancing is maintained. The first day has been satisfactory as all the stalls are well spaced out.” Several shopkeepers Metro spoke to said sales were low on Tuesday despite it being Poila Baisakh.“It cost me Rs 400 just to get these vegetables from Hatiara in Rajarhat to here. I have not even been able to raise the money spent on transport,” said Sunil Maity, who hails from Rajarhat. Corporation officials said they would place placards and flexes giving out the directions to the fairground.In Salt Lake, masks were distributed for free at three block markets including the AB, AC and BD market.Civic officials also conducted an awareness programme at the market where preventive measures including social distancing and the use of online modes of payment were discussed.“We distributed the masks and asked people to use hand sanitisers or wash their hands at the facilities placed at the entry and exit point of each market,” said Anindya Chatterjee, the councillor of ward 41 under whose purview the markets fall.",2020-04-14 20:49:00
289,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus: Stepped-up scan for lockdown violation in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The state government is planning to step up surveillance in congested slums and other places in and around Calcutta from where the authorities will receive reports of lockdown violations, the step aimed at fighting the spread of Covid-19.The decision on surveillance was taken at a meeting on Tuesday attended by Calcutta’s mayor Firhad Hakim and senior government officials.“The rapid spread of the coronavirus in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum has left all of us worried. That is why the slums of Calcutta have been identified as areas where surveillance may need to be stepped up,” said an official of the health department.Till Tuesday evening, 55 cornavirus cases, including seven deaths, have been reported from Dharavi. “In Calcutta’s slums, there are common bathing areas and toilets. There are narrow congested lanes and the virus can spread fast,” said the official. “The next 15 days will be important and we are increasing surveillance in Calcutta and other parts of Bengal,” he said.Several fever clinics have been opened in government and private hospitals across the city but officials fear not too many people will turn up there despite running a temperature.The officials feel active surveillance would help in tracking such cases. One official said there were reports that residents of several slums in the city were violating the lockdown.The officials, however, clarified that at this moment they were not planning to impose total lockdown on those areas.“Instead, surveillance will be stepped up. We are planning visit to every house by officials of the health department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The officials will track down people with fever or other symptoms of Covid-19 and send them to isolation wards of SARI hospitals,” said the official. The government has set up several treatment centres for SARI, or severe acute respiratory infection, in Calcutta and other parts of the state. People who have Covid-19 symptoms but not yet diagnosed of being infected by the virus are being admitted there.The Telegraph has reported that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has started a drive that involves civic workers visiting every house and finding out whether anyone has coronavirus symptoms. At Tuesday’s meeting, it was decided that health department workers, too, will be visiting slums to intensify the vigil.In rural areas, the state government is planning to deploy more personnel for fever surveillance.“There will be more accredited social health activists (ASHA), auxiliary nurse midwifery (ANM) personnel and public health nurses,” a health department official said.“All these workers will be provided with vehicles to move around in a large area and carry out fever surveillance.” The officials are also planning to expand community participation by involving NGOs to make the surveillance more effective, said sources.Public health experts said unless the community was involved in house-to-house surveillance, the programme would never succeed.“The number of ASHA and ANM workers and public health nurses is far less than what is required for such a large-scale surveillance. So, NGOs should be involved,” said a public health expert.Metro reported last week that  many people, especially in rural areas, are scared of going to hospital even if  they are having fever. They fear they would be ostracised. “Instead of depending on self-reporting by people, we are planning active surveillance,” the health department official said.",2020-04-14 20:50:00
290,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus outbreak: Covid-19 kits plenty, tests few in Bengal - Telegraph India","The Indian Council of Medical Research has distributed 7,500 kits among the five state-run laboratories in Bengal that are conducting Covid-19 tests, officials at Niced, the laboratory that is distributing the kits among government testing centres, has said.Only 3,081 samples had been tested across the state till date, according to a  bulletin issued by the Bengal government’s health department on Tuesday.“We have distributed 7,500 kits to SSKM Hospital, School of Tropical Medicine, the medical colleges in north Bengal, Malda and Midnapore,” said Shanta Dutta, the director of Niced (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases).Malda Medical College and Hospital is yet to begin the tests, sources in the health department said. “We have 27,000 kits in reserve at Niced. If any of these laboratories want more kits, we can supply them immediately,” Dutta said. Yet, Bengal lags behind all states in number of tests conducted — less than 50 tested per million — according to data from the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. Delhi has so far tested 840 people per million, the highest in the country.The National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (Niced), under the Union health ministry, is the nodal body of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for kit distribution in eastern India, including Bengal. Several scientists and public health experts have said more tests are the need of the hour to identify asymptomatic carriers. Else, they would end up spreading the virus to more people, increasing the risk of community outbreak.No state official was available to comment on the allegation that Bengal was not testing enough.Sources in the government said they were going by the ICMR protocol that says “all symptomatic people who have undertaken international travel in the past 14 days, all symptomatic contacts of confirmed cases, all symptomatic health care workers, all patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), all asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case and all those symptomatic in a hotspot / cluster should be tested”.But several states have broken away from the protocol and are testing more aggressivelyPartho Sarothi Ray, an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, said only more tests can help identify and isolate silent carriers. “The asymptomatic carriers, if not isolated, can pass on the virus to others. A percentage of these newly infected people could need hospitalisation and intensive care. Some may even die,” said Ray, who has specialised in molecular virology.Ideally primary, secondary and tertiary contacts of any positive case should be tested even if asymptomatic, Ray said. Primary contacts are family members and other close contacts of a person who tested positive. Secondary contacts are contacts of primary contacts and tertiary contacts came in contact with secondary contacts.Four state-run institutes conducting tests — SSKM, School of Tropical Medicine and the medical colleges in Midnapore and north Bengal -- together can conduct about 200 tests every day, a source in the health department said.Niced, too, is conducting Covid-19 tests. So are Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and Tata Medical Center.Niced was doing close to 100 tests in the initial days, a health department source said. But the number of tests has gone down since. “We have done more than 90 tests in a day. But we are receiving 17 or 18 samples nowadays. It is up to the state government to decide where they want to send the samples,” Dutta said.Shahid Jameel, who heads an independent public charity that funds research in health and biomedical sciences in India, said the Centre should be asked why Bengal got only 7,500 kits when there is no shortage of kits. He said more tests would enable the state to frame a strategy for now as well as for the post-lockdown period.Antibody-based blood tests that have been approved recently by the ICMR are yet to start. “Kits for rapid tests have not yet arrived,” Dutta said.There are seven laboratories conducting tests in Bengal now. A few more private laboratories - AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake, Peerless Hospital and Suraksha Diagnostics -- have received ICMR’s approval to conduct tests. Three government-run facilities - RG Kar Medical College, Murshidabad Medical College and Command Hospital - are yet to get approval.",2020-04-14 21:01:00

The distribution will be initially restricted to Calcutta and Salt Lake. But it maybe extended to other places outside the city if there is more demand, he said.“We have set a target to offer hand sanitisers and masks to 400 families in the first phase. We want to gradually extend the facility to more people,” Chaudhuri said. “The senior alumni will get priority.”The association has alerted the alumni and other members of the Presidency family through social media about its decision to distribute hand sanitisers and masks. Requisition can be done through WhatsApp.Those who want the items will have to give their details and mention the number of sanitisers and masks they would need. A form sent on WhatsApp has to be filled.Applicants should request for the items only if they need so, the association has said.The home delivery of the items will be done by two companies, the owners of which are members of the alumni association.The companies have the government’s permission for door-to-door delivery of essential commodities. “They have agreed to deliver hand sanitiser bottles and masks free of cost,” Chaudhuri said.The entire programme will be carried out maintaining rules of social distance.The alumni association has bought the first lot of items from the state government on Wednesday evening.Apart from providing sanitisers and masks, the association has decided to launch a campaign to motivate people to use hand sanitisers and masks even after the lockdown is lifted, the association secretary said.",2020-04-15 20:52:00

Over 200 schoolchildren from Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi have been drawing inspiration from lines from books or famous artwork as part of an online initiative to keep children engaged during the lockdown.“Covid-19 and the lockdown had left my daughter upset. She kept asking me when she could go out and why people were dying. A creative task every morning kept her mind off such thoughts,” said Sharanya’s father, Souvik. The Class IV student of The Akshar School now can’t wait to read Tove Jansson’s Tales from Moominvalley, a line from which — “He was the owner of the moonlight on the ground” —  was her prompt.“Schools closed down in March. We did not want children to spend time aimlessly at home. So, we started giving literary prompts to encourage kids to research and create something new every day,” said Ruchira Das, the founder of ThinkArts, which hosted the online initiative.The entries ranged from poems to paintings.  Arhant Jain, 11, would wait for the prompt on the ThinkArts website every morning. “I would keep checking right after breakfast. The lines prompted me to think differently. I love drawing but three prompts made me write poems. And I was not even a fan of poetry before,” said the Class VI student of St Xavier's Collegiate School.

294,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus outbreak: Out of the market to ensure social distance - Telegraph India,"Police have started to enforce the rules of social distancing in markets that have been attracting the largest crowds during the lockdown by shifting out temporary shops from these markets on roads.So far, the police had asked customers to maintain social distance in markets. Circles had been drawn at least a metre apart to ensure people waited for their turn instead of crowding at shops in markets.From Tuesday, several temporary shops have been shifted out of big markets on to the roads, which have been otherwise empty because of the lockdown.Every stall outside the market area is roughly about six feet in length and there is a gap of at least two feet between two stalls.“The permanent structures inside a market where fish and meat are sold have been kept intact. Only the temporary shops that mostly sell grocery items have been shifted out,” an officer in Lalbazar said.The markets in Gariahat, Bagmari, and Behela are some from which temporary shops have been shifted out, thereby expanding the market area.Gariahat market has more than 250 shops, one-third of which has now been shifted out of the market to ensure crowd management. Temporary shops have been shifted out on the link road adjoining the market.Roadside hawkers in the Muchibazar area who sit on either side of Ultadanga Main road have been shifted to the Aurobindo Sangha ground not far from the original location.Similarly, hawkers and temporary shops that used to operate from outside the entrance to Bagmari market will be shifted to Bagmari Park in Maniktala, the police said.An officer said the idea was to ensure not just customers but also shopkeepers maintained social distance. “If safe distance is maintained between two shops, the chance of overcrowding automatically gets minimised.”Efforts are on to implement the same model across all the markets in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area, the police said.Cops, though, have found it difficult to implement the model in wholesale markets in central Calcutta. “It is practically not possible to maintain social distance between labourers who load and unload goods on and from trucks,” an officer posted in the central division said. “At times, gunny sacks weigh close to 100kg and it takes two or more labourers to carry such sacks. We are helpless in such times.”The wholesale markets of Burrabazar, Jorasanko and Posta remain “very crowded all through the year”. Shopkeepers there, too, are trying to follow social distancing rules.",2020-04-15 20:55:00

An important part of the training is to ensure those infected with Covid-19 are not stigmatised.To allay the fears in the minds of the people about Covid-19 a part of the training is to tell them that not all will be severely affected and there will be many with mild infection and that people will recover.The training is also needed to allay the fears of health workers that they might get infected and stigmatised socially, a health department official said.“The training will make them aware how Covid-19 spreads and how people can stay safe. It will allay the fears of health workers and they in turn can spread the message in villages,” Mohammad Mohiuddin, chief, Unicef office for Bengal, said.“Since Asha workers visit homes, the precautionary measures for Covid-19 can be disseminated in the districts through them. The Asha workers are mainly from the districts and their acceptance in villages is more,” he said.The questions that have come up from health workers during the training are mostly related to precautions they should take while visiting homes in villages. The training has focused on ensuring neither health workers nor people in general should stigmatise those infected with Covid-19.The dangers of stigma can result in people hiding the disease or not accessing medical services, the health workers have been told.“Community health workers are being told that they should see to it that general people don’t stigmatise the infected. Health workers should be sensitive with words while communicating with family members of a Covid-19 suspect or someone who has tested positive for the virus,” Kaninika Mitra, health specialist who has been conducting the training, said.'People have to understand that all health workers are not directly dealing with Covid-19 patients. And those who do take necessary precautions not just for themselves but also for their family members because they know that the virus is contagious,' Mitra said.At least 20,000 ANMs and 50,000 Asha workers have been trained so far. They have been told to focus on facts and figures while addressing people and not to be led by messages circulating on 'social media'. The important messages that need to be spread are: follow proper hand hygiene, cough hygiene, social/physical distancing and special attention to high-risk people (those with underlying medical conditions).",2020-04-15 20:59:00

Gusts of wind started blowing around 5pm. The winds picked up speed gradually, reaching close to 50kmph.Frequent streaks of lightning and thunder accompanied the wind as well as the rain thereafter.Social media was flooded with “Nor’wester” posts and pictures. But Wednesday’s squall was not one, said a Met department official said.A Nor’wester is a squall that originates over the heated Chhotanagpur Plateau in late afternoon and sweeps through parts of eastern India over the next three to five hours at a windspeed of over 45kmph. It is usually followed by a brief spell of rain.The origin of Wednesday’s  squall was a cyclonic circulation and not the Chhotanagpur Plateau, said a Met official.“The circulation was hovering over Bankura, Jhargram, East and West Midnapore, Burdwan, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas and Calcutta,” said G.K. Das, the director of the India Meteorological Department, Calcutta.The system is likely to bring a similar spell of winds and rain on Thursday afternoon onwards, he said.The first half of Wednesday was hot and sultry. The maximum temperature was 35.6 degrees, a notch above normal, and the maximum relative humidity was 92 per cent.Thursday’s first half will see a dip in the Celsius, thanks to the wind and rain on Wednesday.

The Class XI students have already written their language papers. “For most students, only an elective paper is pending,” an official in the higher secondary council said.The decision to postpone the HS and Class XI examinations had been taken last month  in keeping with the precautionary measures adopted by the state government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.The government had first announced that education institutions would remain closed from March 16 to March 31. The closure was extended till April 14 as the 21-day nationwide lockdown was in place. Later, the closure was extended further till June 10.",2020-04-15 21:08:00
303,Subhankar Chakraborty,Coronavirus lockdown: Workers cut short mission impossible - Telegraph India,"A group of 106 migrant workers from Bengal stuck in Thane, Maharashtra, because of the lockdown decided to cycle all the way home to North 24-Parganas, more than 2,200km away, but cut short their journey after hearing about Tuesday’s police crackdown at Bandra station.   Yunus Ali, 26, a tailor in Yogeshwari, was among those who had embarked on the mission impossible.Yunus, along with Selima Biswas, 36, Irshad Mandal, 28, and others had started off on cycles from Indira Nagar, Bhayandar East, on Tuesday afternoon.The fleet comprised 50 cycles and among those riding them were labourers at steel factories and masons.Most rode the cycles that they use to reach railway stations on their way to work every morning. A few cycles were donated by a group of Thane residents with roots in Bengal.Each cycle carried two workers who took turns at the pedal.  “It would have taken us seven, may be eight days. It did not matter. We were starving and out of resources. We were so desperate that we thought of cycling to our our villages,” said Yunus, whose home is in Dakshin Shimulia village, Baduria.“Our stock of food that representatives of NGO Prantojon, that operates from Bengal, had bought for us at the start of the lockdown ran out on Saturday. We approached the Thane Nagar police station but the help they provided was not enough,” said Irshad Mandal, who hails from Aatghara village in Swarupnagar, North 24- Parganas.Yunus and his colleagues cut short the journey after they came to know about the police crackdown on migrant workers who had assembled at Bandra station on Tuesday, hoping to catch a train home.   At least 1,000 migrant workers, including those from Bengal, stranded in Mumbai had gathered near Bandra station on Tuesday afternoon, demanding to be allowed to return home, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an extension of the lockdown till May 3. Police allegedly lathicharged to disperse the mob.“We suspended the journey as I received an alert on my mobile. What if police had assaulted us? We had women in our group. Prantojon members advised us to return and promised to help,” Yunus said. Soumya Sahin of the New Town-based Prantojon said the plight of the likes of Yunus revealed the lack of planning  behind the lockdown. “They haven’t earned anything for close to a month. They have to pay monthly rents. The help from the police is meagre. They told us that police verbally abused them so much that they did not feel like approaching them again,” said Sahin, who teaches economics at the National University of Juridical Sciences.Sahin transferred money through Google-Pay to Yunus, enabling him to buy rice, pulses and other items on Wednesday.",2020-04-15 21:08:00
304,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus lockdown: Help us: Migrants stuck in Nashik - Telegraph India,"A group of 30 workers from Bengal stuck in Nashik, Maharashtra, have been sharing two makeshift tin rooms and surviving on bare minimum food since the start of the countrywide lockdown .A few in the group are from the North 24-Parganas part of the Sunderbans, while most others are from the Gosaba block in the South-24 Parganas part of the Sunderbans. They were working on a highway construction between Nashik and Mumbai.Desperate to return home, they have appealed to the Bengal government for help. Many have said they have run out of money. They have accused the contractor of refusing to provide them with food till two days ago.“We were eating one meal a day because we had run out of money. We had hoped the lockdown would be lifted after April 14 and we would either get back to work or return home,” Biswajit Roy, one of the 30 workers, told Metro over phone on Wednesday.The contractor started providing them with basic food twice a day from Tuesday, Roy said. A Left trade union gave them potatoes and rice on Wednesday.Roy said they had joined work between January and February. “We received payments till March 15 and had sent the money back home. Work stopped after March 15 because of the coronavirus. There has been no payment since as we work as daily labourers.”On Tuesday, thousands of migrant workers in Mumbai's Bandra and Gujarat's Surat had staged agitations, demanding transport back home. This followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of extending the countrywide lockdown till May 3. “We want to go home,” Nani Biswas, 38. said. He has a son and wife at home. Biswas, who was previously engaged in a construction project in Andhra Pradesh, said skilled workers earned between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000, depending on the extra hours they could manage.Unskilled labourers get between Rs 3,500 and Rs 6,000, another worker said.Workers used to get Rs 200-300 a week to buy essential items, or get a haircut, Sarkar, who has a wife, son and elderly mother back home in the Sunderbans, said. “Our last month's wage has not been deposited as the company said there were problems because of the lockdown…. Now, the contractor has promised to provide us with food.”Several among the workers said they were marginal farmers and owned small plots back home in the Sunderbans. The paddy and vegetable grown on their lands are inadequate to feed their families through the year, they said.One of the workers said his friends from other blocks of the Sunderbans were stuck in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. “We speak to them over phone. They are facing problems of getting food.”",2020-04-15 21:09:00

306,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Caution over conduct near water taps and tankers - Telegraph India,"A large number of Calcuttans who get their daily water after  standing in queues in front of community taps should be made aware about the possible dangers around these public sources of water if they do not act responsibly, public health professionals have said.  They insist the civic body should clearly communicate to citizens to not touch a tap unless their hands are cleaned with soap and to maintain social distancing while waiting in a queue to collect water from a community tap or tankers sent by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The civic body sends tankers to areas that lack a  distribution network.Public health experts said the CMC could ask its personnel to pour water from tankers into containers brought by people. The CMC personnel, the experts said,  should maintain hand hygiene before doing so.“The municipal corporation has to communicate the message to people on how to collect water. In many localities, especially in slums, people queue up to collect water from a community tap. The authorities have to clearly educate them about the need to touch the tap only with clean hands. Someone should not cough or sneeze while collecting water from a tap,” said V.K. Madhavan, the chief executive of WaterAid India, a non-profit organisation that works for improving access to clean water, clean toilets and hygiene. “By now people have understood the need for social distancing, but the necessity of maintaining hand hygiene while using a common resource like a community tap needs to be emphasised, too.  The CMC has a major role to play in this.” Mohammad Mohiuddin, the head of the Bengal office of Unicef, too, stressed the importance of communication. “We have been telling people in districts where we work to maintain social distancing,” he said.“It is the same protocol that has to be followed in market s and while standing in a queue to collect water. One must also be careful while touching a community tap that hundreds of people use,” said Mohiuddin. Unicef runs its water, sanitation and hygiene programmes in Purulia, South 24-Parganas, Malda and Murshidabad. A CMC official said it had  asked the helper and driver of tankers to operate the taps. “The driver and helper are operating the taps. Others are not allowed to touch them. Besides, in some places people are leaving their containers and standing apart. Our personnel are using hosepipes and filling the containers. It is only after the tanker leaves that people come and collect their containers,” he said. An expert said the CMC could spread awareness about the necessity of hand hygiene through loudspeakers, radio messages and by pasting posters. An official in the CMC said 114 water tankers, each of 3,500 to 4,000litre capacity, were doing seven trips every day to provide water to some pockets.",2020-04-15 21:10:00
309,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown: Shops shut to stop crowding in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A temporary market in Jagatpur near Baguiati was shut down on Thursday because it had been attracting large crowds every day in violation of the social distancing norms.There are around 200 stalls made of tin and bamboo in the market, barely 1km from VIP Road, along the banks of Kestopur canal, an official of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said.Every morning, hundreds were converging at the market to buy vegetables, fruits, chicken and fish, the official said.The 2-km stretch of Adarshapally Road between the Kestopur bus stop on VIP Road and Hatiara used to be clogged with shoppers. “It was not possible to enforce social distancing rules on such a huge crowd,” the official said.Metro had earlier reported how the corporation had shifted out at least 160 temporary stalls from their usual spots in the Baguiati market to a nearby fairground to control the large number of people who would gather at the market every day in violation of social distancing norms.Temporary shops have been shifted out of Gariahat, Bagmari, and Behala markets to prevent overcrowding.So far, customers had been asked to maintain social distance and the corporation had undertaken several measures to ensure it was followed but “everything fell flat”, the corporation official said.“We had drawn circles a metre apart from each other to ensure people waited for their turn instead of crowding in front of a shop. We had repeatedly asked people over loudhailers to maintain distance… deputed civic officials in the market to distribute leaflets on the importance of maintaining social distance,” the official said. “But none of these made any difference as the market kept drawing one of the largest crowds in the area.”A member of the Jagatpur market’s administrative committee said masks and gloves had been distributed to shopkeepers but “hardly anyone used them and nobody followed the social distancing norms”. “It was getting increasingly risky… so we asked shopkeepers to close down.”Pranay Kumar Ray, the mayoral council member, health, said corporation officials had held a meeting with the market committee and a search was on for alternative sites where some of the shops can be allowed to operate.In Salt Lake, cops have been posted at every market to ensure people maintain a gap of at least a metre while standing in a queue and that all shops shut down by 6pm, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.",2020-04-16 21:23:00

314,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Online test for some CBSE students   - Telegraph India,"Students of Classes IX and XI in several CBSE schools will have to write online tests for promotion to the next class.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had issued a circular earlier this month, asking schools to promote students of Classes IX and XI to the next year on the basis of school assessments or by giving them an opportunity to appear in online or offline tests. This was meant for schools which could not complete their examination, evaluation and promotion process before the lockdown. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has announced that schools in the state will remain shut till June 10.Bhavan’s Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, Mahadevi Birla World Academy and Birla Bharati are some of the schools that will conduct online tests for a handful of shortlisted students who could not be promoted on the basis of internal assessments and projects.The board had said: “...schools are advised to promote students of grades IX and XI to the next grades on the basis of all the school  based assessments including project work, periodic tests, term exams, etc conducted so far... for any child who is unable to clear this internal process (In any number of subjects), the school may utilise this period for providing remedial interventions, and school may give the opportunity of appearing in school based test/s online or offline”.“We will take oral online tests.

The students have been given a truncated syllabus,” said Anjana Saha, the principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy. The school has scheduled an online test for three students of Class IX on April 20 and eight students of Class XI on April 20. Bhavan’s Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir will conduct an online test for about seven students of Classes IX and XI next month. The school had some exams pending, included two subjects in Class XI and one subject in Class IX, that had to be deferred because of the lockdown.“The students were promoted on the basis of the average of internal exams and soft copies of report cards have been distributed,” said G.V. Subramanian, the secretary and director of the school.Before conducting the online tests, the schools have also had to ensure that the students have access to computers.“To make it easier for them we have decided to take MCQ- pattern oral tests,” said Apala Dutta, principal of Birla Bharati.

Since the incubation period for Covid-19 is considered to be 14 days, a person can develop symptoms during that period and we might fail to spot it,” a CMC official said.“Now that we have a team of people who would call residents whose homes have been visited, the surveillance would be stronger. The chances of missing someone who has developed symptoms get minimised because our people would call them. But we cannot do anything if someone hides that he/she has developed Covid-19 symptoms,” the official said.Mayor Firhad Hakim held a meeting with health department officials at the civic headquarters on Thursday, after which teams were formed. The teams will work together with the borough executive health official.Metro had on April 9 reported that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was going to start door-to-door surveillance in all wards. CMC officials had then spoken of the challenge of covering so many homes with staff-shortage.The 2011 Census pegged the population of Calcutta at close to 4.5 million. The civic body’s health department has around 600 honorary health workers who are trained to collect data and note down replies to a set of questions.Another 1,400 are engaged in work related to information, education and communication on various diseases.The teams formed on Thursday will be doing what a set of CMC personnel has been doing for some time.Some CMC personnel has been engaged in the task of speaking to people who had arrived from countries hit by the novel coronavirus every day or in two-three days’ interval to check on their health status and to find out if they have developed any symptoms of Covid-19.The moment someone speaks about some symptoms, they are advised to visit a hospital and seek medical opinion. Their report is sent to the state health department for further tracking and ensuring he/she seeks a doctor’s opinion.The net of surveillance has now been extended to people arriving from any country and from other states in the country.Public health experts have said that tracing, tracking and isolating potential Covid-19 people is an essential strategy in containing the spread of the disease.",2020-04-16 21:30:00
318,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Fever clinic on Belle Vue premises - Telegraph India,"Belle Vue Clinic has set up a fever clinic outside the hospital building, the culmination of a process that officials said got delayed because of the lockdown. The fever clinic started earlier this week. Belle Vue officials said the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission had asked them to set up the clinic in the middle of March.For the clinic, the hospital authorities had initially planned to bring from New Town a container that was lying on the premises of their upcoming nursing college, said Pradip Tondon, the chief executive officer of Belle Vue.  It was converted into a makeshift clinic by March 22  but then the lockdown kicked in and it could not be transported to the Loudon Street address of the hospital. “We had arranged for permission from the state government but no trawler was available. Nor was there any driver because of the lockdown,” said an official of the hospital.  Since the container could not be brought to the hospital, the authorities approached an agent who sets up stages and pandals for programmes. The order was placed last Friday and the makeshift clinic was up and running earlier this week, said Belle Vue officials.   The 350sq ft structure has prefabricated steel covered with plastic sheets. It has two rooms — patients wait in one and doctors examine them in the other. “The clinic has been set up in front of that part of the building where the eye hospital functions. People entering the hospital are screened and those with fever are being sent to the clinic,” said an official. “Officials of the commission had visited us in the middle of March and asked us to set up the fever clinic outside the main building of the hospital,” said CEO Tondon. Many people with fever are showing up voluntarily at the clinic, said officials. “Till date, no one has been referred to a Covid-19 designated hospital because they don't have symptoms of the disease,” said the official.",2020-04-16 21:31:00
319,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Several quarantine units coming up in Calcutta municipal area - Telegraph India,"Several quarantine centres are being set up in the Calcutta municipal area to isolate and quarantine contacts of people who test positive but lack space at home to stay isolated from others, officials of the civic body said on Thursday.Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said they were realising that a lot more people from the city needed to be isolated in the coming days than what was being done over the past few weeks, a reason why the quarantine centres are being set up. These centres are the first ones being opened in the Calcutta municipal area. Two quarantine centres had been established in New Town — at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) and NBCC Square. While the CNCI campus has been converted into a Covid-19 hospital, NBCC Square is still a quarantine centre.The state had also used some hotels in New Town to quarantine people in some cases, such as when doctors at the NRS Medical College and Hospital had to be kept in isolation.The CMC has identified four buildings where quarantine centres are being set up. These four — located in Anandapur, Tiljala, Kasba and Behala — together can accommodate more than 750 individuals. One of the buildings houses an educational institution, one a women’s hostel, one a yet-to-be-occupied office of a real estate company and the fourth the office of a professional body. Civic officials said the real estate company’s office would have 350 beds, while the one that housed an educational institution would have 300 beds. “Even if a building is large enough, it cannot accommodate too many beds. Various factors such as number of toilets on a floor and the space required to maintain adequate social distancing between two beds are being considered,” said the official. Atin Ghosh, the deputy mayor of Calcutta who also heads the CMC’s health department, said people were quarantined in at least one centre in Topsia, a property belonging to  a media company. He said the quarantine centres were being set up under  instructions from the state health department. “The health department asked us to set up quarantine centres within Calcutta. We are identifying buildings where the centres can be set up,” he said. An official said the search for the centres had started about a week ago.  The CMC is identifying buildings in  five other locations, where another 300 beds can be set up, said another official. The locations include Sinthee, Behala, Chitpore and Regent Park.The CMC’s personnel have started door-to-door surveillance of homes across Calcutta, with special emphasis on densely populated areas such as  slums where several people share a room and there is hardly any scope to maintain social distancing. If any person from a densely populated place like a slum tests positive, his/her contacts will have to be quarantined. “We have started door-to-door surveillance in densely populated areas like slums. In such places, people often live in homes where multiple residents share a room. It is impossible to maintain physical distance between individuals in such homes, which is why we are creating quarantine centres,” said a CMC official. According to the official, if the surveillance team comes across anyone with symptoms like fever, sore throat, runny nose or respiratory distress, the person’s condition  will be reported to the state health department. If the department asks the CMC to get the person tested for Covid-19, civic personnel will help him or her reach a hospital where the test is done. “If this person tests positive, she/he will be admitted to hospital and the contacts will have to be quarantined. That is not possible in a room crammed with people,” said the official.The CMC will ensure that basic facilities such as adequate water, clean toilets, electricity, beds and mattresses are in place at the quarantine centres. Police will be deployed around the centres so that no one could step out. No unauthorised person will be allowed to step in either. “Our central store is procuring beds and mattresses and sending them to the quarantine centres,” the official added.",2020-04-16 21:35:00

This number is from those five blocks alone. The actual number of people in a similar or worse condition in the entire region will be huge,” said Sankar Halder, the founder of Mukti, whose work includes agricultural support for farmers, education of children and self-help business groups for women, to name a few.Mukti has just concluded a survey among dependent families in Patharpratima, Mathurapur I, Mathurapur II, Joynagar II and Kultali blocks in the wake of the lockdown. The survey categorised the families into three sections, the third being the worst-hit.“The results show that 5,000 families are in the third category, meaning they need an immediate supply of food and water,” said Halder, an IT professional who had founded Mukti in 2003.Mukti has arranged dry ration, oil and other essential stuff for around 2,000 families, with help from some Calcutta-based organisations, led by the Kolkata Gives Foundation. But the fate of many others remains uncertain.Halder shared a series of videos with Metro that captured the mood of the households the Mukti volunteers visited during the survey.One such video shows a middle-aged woman, with a baby in her lap, and a hearing impaired man next to her in a mud house. Another woman is seen in the background beside what looks like mud oven. A girl is sitting near the woman.“Khawa jutchhena. Ranna korbo bose achhi. Kintu ranna korbo ki diye (We are not getting food. I am ready to cook but what do I cook?),” the middle-aged woman asks the volunteer.Another video shows an elderly couple sitting in another mud house, with tarpaulin sheets acting as walls. The woman, who identifies herself as Geeta Naskar, says she is a “cancer patient” and shows a big red lump on her right breast. “We don’t have anything to eat, nor any money to buy his medicine. Our son works in Calcutta. He has come back and is out in search of some cash or food,” she says, before breaking down.The men of the families are involved in farming, organic farming and fishing. The women are part of self-help groups that make puffed rice, pickles, bori, dairy and other edibles. The women are also involved in poultry farming. They sell their products in the local wholesale markets from where the produce is sold in Calcutta and other places.But the lockdown has shut most wholesale markets. The entire supply chain, from wholesaler to transporter to retailer, has been crippled.“Only one or two small bazaars are open. Say a farmer produces 200 quintals of ladies’ fingers, he can sell only a minuscule portion in the retail market. His main source of income is the wholesale market. If that is shut, the farmer’s income is also gone,” Raghunath Bairagi, a Mukti volunteer, said. “Around 95 per cent of our sales channels are shut.”The NGO has been ferrying a small portion of the organic produce to sell it at some of the city’s apartment blocks.Lakhs from the Sunderbans embark on short journeys on packed suburban trains to and from Calcutta, where they work as domestic help or sell vegetables at markets. A majority of these people have also come back with little or no cash, said Bairagi.",2020-04-16 21:43:00

The shields, made of fibreglass that is used in helmet visors, have been distributed among 175 doctors and other health workers. The protective gear covers the entire face, from the forehead till the chin, and is worn in addition to prescribed gear such as N95 masks, goggles, personal protective equipment, gloves and shoe covers.“Lots of Covid-19 patients and those with symptoms are being treated at MR Bangur Hospital and all health-care workers are being provided with PPE kits. However, these kits do not have good face shields. I was concerned about the partial exposure of the face since a large number of health-care workers are getting infected every day across the world,” said Makhan Lal Saha, the head of the surgery department at SSKM Hospital and governing council member of the Association of Surgeons of India. Saha and his family, along with Rishav Dev Patra, a paediatric surgeon at SSKM, and the  management of Eskag Sanjeevani Multispeciality Hospital, Bagbazar, raised funds for the fibreglass visors .“The shields were procured in three days. They prevent droplets from infecting  health-care workers,” said Saha.“There are about 600 health-care providers, including doctors, at our hospital. The shields were distributed among 175 of them,” said an official of MR Bangur Hospital.Saha said he was planning to distribute such shields to all health-care workers in Bengal’s Covid-19 treatment centres. The next point of distribution will be the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital. The Covid-19 task force of doctors, set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, will request the state government to provide additional protective gear to health-care workers.“If a large number of doctors and nurses start getting infected while treating coronavirus patients, the entire system might collapse. Also, even if a small number get infected, the morale of doctors and nurses would be down and the treatment would be affected,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, a physician and member of the task force. “Any additional safety shield which would not compromise treatment is welcome,” he said. In Spain, which has witnessed the world’s highest reported rate of Covid-19 infection among health-care workers, there have been reports that doctors and nurses are using improvised devices. Doctors have shared images of their colleagues using garbage bags, raincoats and other improvised materials to protect themselves from the virus.The Union ministry of health has provided a guideline for PPE components that include goggles, face-shield, mask, gloves, coverall/gowns (with or without aprons), head cover and shoe cover. 'Contamination of mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth is likely in a scenario of droplets generated by cough, sneeze of an infected person or during aerosol generating procedures carried out in a clinical setting. Inadvertently touching the eyes/nose/mouth with a contaminated hand is another likely scenario. Hence protection of the mucous membranes of the eyes/nose/mouth by using face shields/ goggles is an integral part of standard and contact precautions,' the ministry has said. Shortage of personal protective equipment, used by doctors and other healthcare workers treating Covid-19 patients, is faced by countries across the world and in many places improvised equipment are being used.   In Spain, where world's highest reported rate of Covid-19 infection for healthcare workers has been reported till date, there have been reports that doctors and nurses are using improvised devices.

He cannot stop washing his hands every 15 minutes and is constantly anxious about death and separation. Rahul was a carefree youth who wouldn’t ever think about death. Now, sitting in one corner of his room, he cannot control his thoughts about this illness. He is glued to the television screen at all times.As the lockdown was extended, there has been a surge in insecurities among people. An invisible curtain has been pulled down and people are feeling helpless, restless and uncertain about their future. Majority are having difficult-to-control bouts of panic, dread, and despair.Apart from the physical effects that are associated with Covid-19, we need to be cautious about the psychological and social effects that this virus is about to create, which would have a long-lasting effect on people. This needs to be addressed immediately for the well-being of people across the country. The immunity of a person also partly depends on his/her mental state and hence, we need to know how to deal with anxiety.Awareness about the disease, its treatment mode, the probable quarantine phase, the governmental strategies need to be addressed in detail. It is time to realise that mental disturbances arising out of Covid-19 pose a real issue.We need to focus our attention towards people who already live on the margins, many of whom rely on consistent, face-to-face support for survival.The cost of this virus would not be limited to deaths but would create a negative impact in the form of child abuse, domestic violence, hunger and long-term educational and behavioural problems.Fight quarantine bluesThe media can play a major role. News should focus not only on deaths but emphasis should also be laid on stories of recovery. Frequent news of effective treatment techniques and interviews of individuals who have recovered could cut down the growing fear and insecurities.People need to get as much information as possible from reliable sources so that they are not affected by fake news circulating on social media.Trust and assurance that regular supply of food materials is adequate in the locality would stop people from visiting markets frequently and chances of being exposed to the virus would reduce.Helpline numbers should be made available so that people can get both physical and mental support.Job assurance without curtailing wages of employees is essential.It is not only the poor people who need assistance. Individuals from all economic and educational backgrounds might need psychosocial assistance and support. The growing anxiety, stress, insecurity and depression need to be addressed.Everyone should try to increase their communication with loved ones through mobiles, video-chatting and other facilities so that the physical distancing does not create social distancing in the long run and an apathy towards meeting people.Psychological effects like panic attacks, severe depression, crushing bouts of anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations and thoughts of self-harm and suicide could rise if the lockdown continues for an indefinite period.

The soya chunks were meant for the Centre’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) project.Officers of the enforcement branch seized 260kg of soya chunks from the house in a government colony at Padmapukur in the Regent Park area on Wednesday. Small packets of soya chunks had been stuffed inside gunny bags with “Not for sale, only for ICDS supply” written on them.The arrested have been charged with sections under the essential commodities act and sections of cheating and criminal conspiracy. “All three have been remanded in police custody for three days,” said the deputy commissioner (enforcement branch), Biswajit Ghosh.",2020-04-16 21:48:00
325,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus Lockdown: Sweet shops to open at 8am  - Telegraph India,"Sweet shops across Bengal can remain open from 8am to 4pm, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday, extending the earlier noon-to-4pm window.The state government had earlier allowed sweet shops to remain open from noon to 4pm. The relaxation followed a letter from the traders, who had pointed out that closure of their units was leading to huge loss of milk.“We have been getting feedback about poor footfall. So, we decided to extend the timings from 8am to 4pm,” the chief minister said at Nabanna.Only around 25 per cent of the more than 9,000 sweet shops in Calcutta have been opening, according to the Paschimbanga Mistanna Byabasayee Samity. “Hardly anyone comes to the shops in the afternoon. Most people go to the market in the morning and return home before noon, when the sweet shops open,” said Jagannath Ghosh, the secretary of the samity. “More shops are likely to open after the extension.”The association had written again to the chief minister on March 31, complaining about lack of customers.“The decision is welcome. It will allow us to consider opening our outlets,” said Dhiman Das, executive director of KC Das, whose outlets have remained shut so far.",2020-04-16 21:49:00
327,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus lockdown: Some lanes sealed in Covid-19 fight - Telegraph India,"Some roads in Calcutta were sealed with guardrails on Friday to prevent vehicles and residents of the neighbourhood from coming out.In these areas, police used loudhailers to announce that people should remain indoors and must not step out of the barricaded areas.A section of police officers said that  unlike the barricades in Howrah — where the government has imposed Section 144 of the CrPC — some of the barricades in Calcutta leave space for people to move out in case of an emergency. Some, however, have completely sealed the roads.Calcutta mayor Firhad Hakim told Metro that entire wards would not be sealed anywhere in Calcutta. “We are sealing off particular places from where cases have been reported. For example, we have sealed three lanes in a Belgachhia bustee, two lanes in Ultadanga and one lane in Narkeldanga. Most of the places being sealed are around slums.”He added: “Police are erecting barricades in these places to stop people from going out. If the residents need grocery, medicines or any essential items, they can contact the police. The cops will make arrangements so that the essentials are delivered to them,” he added.  A senior police officer said the attempt was more to create “a mental barricade” to keep people off the thoroughfares and to stop free movement of vehicles on the roads.An officer cited an example to show how police have been helping residents in areas where the lockdown is being stepped up. An elderly gentleman needed to go to the bank to withdraw cash. “The police went to the bank for him,” said an officer of south division.Several pockets that otherwise remain busy — such as Picnic Garden Road, VIP Bazaar, Canal East Road, Zakaria Street, Scott Lane, Chetla Hat Road near Alipore, Padmapukur in Bhowanipore, CIT Road, Belgachhia, Narkeldanga Main Road and Rajabazar — bore a deserted look after the roads were sealed on Friday.Despite the lockdown, which started three weeks ago, there has been a continuous string of prosecutions and arrests for violating the lockdown in the city, suggesting that a section of citizens has been coming out on the roads without any pressing reason.The city had earlier seen such barricades only during festivals, big political rallies, Republic Day and Independence Day parades.The police posted at the VIP Bazaar crossing were restricting the movement of all types of vehicles through the barricaded zone.“If we are not strict from Day One, no one is going to take us seriously. We have been instructed to ensure that nothing can pass through these barricades,” said an officer of the traffic police.People in some of the vehicles that were stopped on Friday were returning home. They were not allowed through the sealed stretch.Sumit Chowdhury, a resident of CN Roy Road, had to take special permission from Tiljala police station to take his motorcycle out and go to Jadavpur with food for his elderly aunt, he told Metro while returning home. “Aajke prothom pishike khabar dite giye eto oshubidhe holo (today was the first time that I had to face so much trouble while taking food to my elderly aunt),” Chowdhury said.Stretches such as Park Circus and Rajabazar, Picnic Garden, Bhowanipore and Padmapukur bore a “different” look on Friday.“This area was teeming with people on the eve of Poila Baisakh — people were queuing up in front of meat shops as if there was no lockdown. On the contrary, only two medicine shops are open today,” said a police officer in the Tiljala area.The officer in charge of a police station in the port division tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, said joint commissioner (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. Sources said steps were being taken to identify the people who had come in direct contact with the officer recently.The slums along Chetla Hat Road, where people usually spend their afternoons chatting outside their dingy one-room homes, had all residents indoors. A rickshaw-puller sitting idle said: “Corona hoyechhe boley, lokjon bhoy bhetore chole gechhe. Police rasta bondho kore  diyechhe (People are scared of the coronavirus and have fled inside their homes. Police have blocked all the roads),” he said.Around 2.45pm, two vehicles of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation entered the slum to fumigate the area.At Padmapukur, the police had put up posters written in Hindi, making an appeal to the people to remain indoors and announcing that legal steps would be taken against those found violating the lockdown.Entire Zakaria Street was sealed; a lone fruit seller was sitting on the pavement. The road to the Belgachhia slum, adjoining Belgachhia Metro station, was sealed on Friday afternoon.“No one is allowed to enter or come out. If someone needs something, they can call us (police),” said an officer posted near Belgachhia Metro station.“I have never seen a barricade in my locality before. Usually, people here are reluctant to follow traffic rules, too. But today, for a change, there were no bikes on the road,” said a college student who lives in Ultadanga, close to Belgachhia.",2020-04-17 20:40:00
328,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: 70-plus and cured in twin signals of hope  - Telegraph India,"A 76-year-old woman and a 70-year-old man, both of whom had tested positive for Covid-19, have been cured and discharged from hospital. Doctors are citing their cases to drive home the point that all is not lost even if an elderly person gets the infection. It is true that the aged are more vulnerable to Covid-19, doctors said, but there are examples in almost every country of people above 60 returning home from hospital after defeating the virus. The condition of one of the two elderly patients, both of who were treated at the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital, turned critical but he did not need to be put on ventilator. The 70-year-old man, from Madhyamgram, was discharged on Thursday and the 76-year-old woman, from Narendrapur, on April 4. Both are hale and hearty and without any complications, they told Metro. “When I was admitted to hospital, doctors asked me if I was feeling scared. I told them why should I when there were so many doctors, nurses and other specialists all around? Their job was to help me recover and they did it very well,” the woman said. The man, too, said unnecessary panic would only worsen the situation. “I will tell everyone to follow basic hygiene. Do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth, especially after touching a surface because you do not know whether it is contaminated or not. Also wash your hands with soap and water frequently. Always wear a mask when you are out. That is all we need to do as common people,” he said.The WHO website mentions that “older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus”. But it also adds: “Most of the people who catch Covid-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies”. The website also mentions that “people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)”. According to the state health department’s Friday bulletin, 55 people have been cured of Covid-19 and discharged from hospital in Bengal. Figures provided by the Union health ministry show 1,749 people have been cured across the country. A doctor at the Beleghata hospital who treated both patients said that while the man had developed some complications, the woman was fit and fine all through. What amazed the doctor was the courage of both. “They had such positivity that we, the medical service providers, felt energised seeing and talking to them,” said the doctor. The doctor said the man had severe respiratory distress and low blood oxygen levels when he was admitted. He had to be administered high-flow oxygen. Doctors suspected that he had developed “a secondary bacterial infection, superimposed on Covid-19, which exacerbated his breathing difficulty”. The woman said though she did not develop any complications from Covid-19, she had breathing trouble for long and used an inhaler as advised by a doctor. Besides, as a patient of rheumatoid arthritis she was on immunosuppressant, which made her immunity compromised and doctors were worried about it. “We managed to cure them. These two patients prove that even someone above 60 can survive after  catching the virus. Keep faith in doctors, nurses and keep faith in science,” the doctor said.The woman was a contact of a patient from Calcutta, who had gone to Egra to attend a wedding. “I was first quarantined at a hospital in East Midnapore’s Egra. When I tested positive, I was brought to the Beleghata ID Hospital,” she said. The 70-year-old man, a resident of Madhyamgram, said that people should be extra cautious to avoid catching the infection. He said though his recovery was timely and without much difficulty for him, it was a lonely one. “Throughout the days I had only to eat and sleep at the hospital. There was nothing else to do. I was kept in a cabin with glass partitions through which I could see others in the ward, but we could not interact. It is this loneliness during the recovery that bothered me. This was painful,” he said The other factor that bothered him was that because of his catching the infection, his family and friends had to be quarantined at Barsat. The woman’s son, daughter-in-law and grandson too were quarantined at MR Bangur. The advice for both the septuagenarians during their discharge was to stay indoors for another 14 days at least. While the man just started his home quarantine after release from hospital on Thursday, the woman would be done with the 14-day home quarantine period on Saturday. “At home too, I have maintained a safe distance from my son, daughter-in-law and grandson.",2020-04-17 20:44:00

But the kitchens of a handful of eateries are still preparing food for thousands of people.The food is not for regular patrons but people who have never entered a fancy eatery — residents of slums, orphanages and shelters for the destitute.Eight city-based restaurants have come together to serve cooked food to the underprivileged in the wake of the lockdown,  that started in the city on March 23. The food being prepared at the restaurant kitchens is being distributed with the help of police and a network of NGOs.The exercise is part of the nationwide campaign Feed the Needy, by the National Restaurant Association of India, which represents more than 5 lakh dine-out addresses across India.1000BC, Barbeque Nation, Kaidi Kitchen, Khichdi Khichri, Refinery 091, Sanjha Chulha, The Grid and Wow! Momo, all part of the association’s Calcutta chapter, have come together for the exercise.The restaurants are shut for diners and some are only delivering food via online aggregators. But their kitchens are operational to make food for people in slums, orphanages and other areas.If masala khichdi is being made in one kitchen, another is preparing roti and sabzi. A third is making rice, daal and a curry, another is making vegetable rolls.“The menu is being decided according to the availability of raw material. The food is nothing fancy. It is simple but being made with love and served hot. Till now, the feedback has been great,” said Asif Ahmed, the owner of Sanjha Chulha and one of the organisers of the campaign.His brand has four outlets. Only one is operational, for online delivery and to feed the needy.The association of restaurants (NRAI) is coordinating with the police. The local police stations are sending their vehicles to collect the food from the restaurants. The NRAI volunteers are networking with NGOs who are distributing the food.The campaign had started on March 24. Around 125 packets of food were prepared on Day 1. Now, around 20,000 meals are now being prepared every day.One of the destinations the food is reaching is Universal Smile, a home for around 40 children, near the Ruby intersection. “We are stretching our resources to keep the shelter running. The food from the campaign has been of great help,” said Ankita Roy Chowdhury, who started the home with her husband in 2013. “Food is the most fundamental need of the people.... In Calcutta, we are currently serving nearly 20,000 meals daily and want to take it to at least a lakh a day,” said Sagar Daryani of Wow! Momo.",2020-04-17 20:49:00
331,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus lockdown: Bone out, now travel worry  - Telegraph India","A 16-month-old boy who had to travel nearly 300km from Pakur in Jharkhand to SSKM Hospital to get a meat bone stuck in his respiratory tract extracted has been discharged from the hospital but his family had to spend Rs 6,000 on the journey home.Shariyat Hussain was discharged from SSKM earlier this week. His family is now worried how to bring him back to SSKM for check-up.“We had to pay Rs 6,000 for an ambulance to return home. Usually, it would take not more than Rs 3,500,” said  the boy's uncle Mubarak, a college student. Doctors at SSKM have scheduled a check-up for Shariyat on April 30. “But the lockdown will continue till May 3. It will be difficult to travel. Earlier, police didn’t stop us because my nephew’s condition was critical. But now we can’t hire a vehicle and ambulances are demanding a very high price,” Mubarak told Metro over phone from Pakur on Friday.The doctors at SSKM have advised the boy’s family to get his stitches cut at a local hospital after a week. “That will be done. But our problem is taking him for a check-up to Calcutta. Even if the lockdown is lifted, we are not sure whether public transport will be allowed,” Mubarak said. The Telegraph had earlier reported how Shariyat's family had taken him to several government and private hospitals in Murshidabad district but none could treat him. Shariyat was initially taken to private and government hospitals in Dhulian and Jangipur. The doctors at Jangipur sub-divisional hospital had referred the boy to the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital in Behrampore. There, he was treated for acute respiratory distress for two days before referring him to the NRS Medical College and Hospital or any other hospital in Calcutta. “We don’t have the required manpower and equipment to treat a critical paediatric patient. Also, we don’t have facility to perform bronchoscopy (a procedure that allows doctors to look into the patient’s air passage and lungs) on kids,” Devdas Saha, the medical superintendent-cum-vice-principal of the Murshidabad medical college had said.The child reached SSKM in such a critical state that he could not undergo surgery on the first two days. The operation was performed last week and the meat bone, 1cm long and 0.5cm wide, was taken out. “He was briefly put on a ventilator after the surgery. But now he is stable and cured. He has no problem in breathing or eating,” said  Kaustuv Das Biswas, an assistant professor at SSKM’s Institute of Otorhinolaryngology and Head Neck Surgery and part of the team that operated on Shariyat.",2020-04-17 20:58:00
333,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Textbooks in e-format for online classes - Telegraph India,"Publishers are providing digital versions and e-content of textbooks to schools to help with virtual classes.The publishing houses are providing a few chapters instead of the entire book to make up for the absence of hard copies, while making sure that the entire content of the book is not available digitally. Teachers and students had been finding it difficult without referring to any textbooks during online classes.“We are conducting online classes and we understand the requirements of the parents. Children come from different backgrounds and they need books to refer to because not all of them are able to retain what is taught in class,” said Bratati Bhattacharyya,  the secretary general of Shri Shikshayatan School. The Heritage School, Indus Valley World School and Birla High School, Mukundapur, are some of the many schools who are using digital versions of the books. Delhi Public School New Town has also approached publishers for e-content. “We have asked for e-files of the first few chapters so that we can share them with students. We had been receiving e-content the last few years and would upload it on our school server but  this time we also need files that we can send to the parents,” said Amita Prasad, the director of Indus Valley World School. The principal of Birla High School-Mukundapur, Minnie Sengupta, said students can refer to the e-content after the online class. Some publishers who have responded to requests from schools are Oxford University Press, Scholastic and Ratna Sagar. “We are not sending the entire book but content that will help teachers cope for a couple of months. If things deteriorate, we might have to send more content,” said Chitralekha Bhaskar, subject matter expert,  Scholastic. Some publishers are sharing PDF files, others are allowing schools password-protected access to e-content. “We had received requests from across the country and some e-content was developed so that first few chapters could be sent to schools,” said Rakesh Paul, business development manager in Bengal, Ratna Sagar.An official of Oxford University Press said schools have been requested to ensure the content is not misused.Schools have asked parents not to copy or share the e-content with anyone because of copyright issues. “Please note it is our responsibility to ensure that this material is used only for the purpose of the students’ learning and not for any unauthorised or commercial purpose,” reads a note from Indus Valley World School to parents.",2020-04-17 21:04:00
334,Dipyaman Ganguly,Coronavirus: the fight & the soldiers - Telegraph India,"An unprecedented pandemic. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused by the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. Infected cases in the world have crossed 2 million and already resulted in more than 1.39 lakh deaths. At this point, India has also reported more than 11,000 cases and over 450 deaths. Due to the “novelty” of this coronavirus, we are not yet equipped with a vaccine or any proven anti-viral drugs to fight this pandemic, although biomedical scientists in India, just like all other parts of the world, have greatly ramped up their research to come up with suitable vaccines and drugs as soon as possible. But one must not think that contracting infection with this novel virus always portends grim outcomes. That is not at all true. Most of the patients who are infected are having very mild disease, just with flu-like symptoms. In some cases there are no symptoms at all. Why Sars-CoV2 is so different?Then why is it wreaking such a havoc worldwide? The secret lies in its propensity of spread. According to a key epidemiological parameter, the Basic Reproductive Ratio, Sars-CoV2 seems to be far more contagious than other recently encountered viruses. What is Basic Reproductive Ratio? In simple terms, it denotes the number of healthy people who can get infected by a single infected person, when the whole population is susceptible. Estimates on the Basic Reproductive Ratio of Sars-CoV2 ranges from 2.2, as per reports from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as well as University of Hong Kong, to 5.5, according to a more recent report from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US. These were calculated based on data from Wuhan. Now let’s remind ourselves what was the Basic Reproductive Ratio for other virus infections which also resulted in more limited pandemics in recent past. The number for the influenza virus that caused the 2009 pandemic was estimated to be 1.4-1.6, for Ebola it is around 1.5-2.5. The high-risk groupsIn some people, the infection comes with undesired outcomes, mostly people who are old, or have pre-existing health conditions, like uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or long-term kidney disease. Age seems to be a critical factor — while, as per Chinese data — only 2 out of 1,000 deaths are reported in children, young adults and people below 40 years of age, the rate goes up to 1 in 10 beyond 70 years of age. Finally, despite the really mild disease in most of the infected people, due to the high contagiousness of the virus the people who are susceptible to rather severe infections have greater chance of contracting the infection.Convalescent plasma: what and why?In the current phase of this pandemic, convalescent plasma therapy, an age-old practice for immunisation, provides great hope for severely ill patients. On infection with such viruses, our body immune system gets into work and starts producing chemicals that can neutralise the viruses and prevent the disease from worsening. These are called antibodies, which are released by specialised cells in the body called B cells. Any person in whom this antibody generation in response to infection is efficient and the antibodies are present in the circulating blood in sufficient quantities, fights the disease better and recovers. But persons whose immune system fails to do this succumbs to the infection. The convalescent plasma therapy works on the premise of equipping this second group of people with the antibodies, taken from the recovered patients, thus supporting their immune system to fight the infection more efficiently. As the antibodies are soluble chemicals and circulate in the blood, one can take the fluid part of the blood, ie. plasma, from the recovered patients and introduce it to the non-recovering patients. Thus recovering patients are assets and their help to passively immunise other patients can save a lot of lives.Biomedical research agencies in India, like the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), have already taken initiative to promote this therapy in different parts of the country. CSIR has already approached the Bengal government to initiate this programme in collaboration with the clinicians working in the designated Covid hospitals. The Bengal government has already approved the proposal and scientists from Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Calcutta, and doctors from Beleghata ID Hospital and the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital have started preparations for this approach. ICMR has already approved a similar trial in Kerala. More such programmes are coming up in many other hospitals all around India. A critical armament in this fight?But these programmes will only be successful if a large number of people, who have recovered from the coronavirus infection, come forward and volunteer to donate their plasma. This is a great way to contribute to this worldwide fight against this pandemic. The fight is being fought by numerous health professionals, doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, police, administration, and last but not the least the citizens who are abiding by the directives in countrywide lockdown. Think of the fight taken up by the kids who are homebound entertaining themselves on their own, while most of them are also unable to attend school. The fight has also touched greatly the workers all around the country who are unable to secure their earnings amidst this lockdown. It is an unprecedented moment in human history when the whole humanity is fighting a menace together. But the volunteering plasma donors will perhaps be the most effective soldiers in this fight. The severely ill patients will greatly benefit from this donated armament to fight off their disease, and recovering them from the infection is perhaps the greatest benchmark for a fight won by the humanity.The writer is a scientist at CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Calcutta (Dipyaman.Ganguly@gmail.com)  ",2020-04-17 21:12:00
336,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Farm-to-kitchen JU students’ drive  - Telegraph India,"Students of Jadavpur University who are running a community kitchen to feed the poor have set up a cooperative with farmers in Bhangar to get their unsold vegetables in exchange for rice and pulses.The students started the community kitchen on the campus last month and set up a cooperative with farmers through a student of Presidency University who is from Bhangar in South 24-Parganas.Bapan Ahmed, the third-year student of Bengali honours and a resident of Narayanpur in Bhangar, floated the idea when he saw vegetables going to waste because farmers could not supply them to markets during the lockdown.“Farmers personally supply vegetables to wholesale markets and local markets beyond Narayanpur. The supply to wholesale markets has taken a hit for want of transport. Farmers are unable to carry stuff to markets outside Narayanpur because of the restrictions in place,” Ahmed said.“Only a part of the produce is being sold at the local market. I knew about the JU community kitchen initiative. So, I contacted them on behalf of 90 farmer families with the concept of setting up a cooperative.”Farmers send their stock to the campus on a vehicle on which the JU students send a stock of rice and pulses. The exchange started last week.The students have so far sent 150kg rice, 120kg pulses and 15kg soya beans in exchange.The mechanism has proved advantageous because vegetables don’t have to be bought, Debjan Sengupta, a research scholar at JU, said. “Vegetables are costlier in markets because of middlemen. That money is being saved because of this arrangement with the farmers. The more we can save, the better for our ‘community kitchen’, which is being crowfunded.”A JU student said it was important to save money because they wanted to feed as many as possible. “When we started the community kitchen, 150 people were being fed… now that number has gone up to 300.”Sengupta said the students knew the farmers since 2018 when there was a movement against forcible land acquisition for the construction of a power substation in Bhangar. JU was part of the platform that had spearheaded the movement. “We have again reached out to each other during another crisis.”",2020-04-17 21:16:00
338,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Eye-opener for students in Metiabruz - Telegraph India,"A group of college and high school students in Metiabruz have come together to raise funds from friends and family and reach out to neighbours who have been going hungry during the lockdown.The experience of going into the interiors of Metiabruz has been an eye-opener for the students as they came across malnourished children, adults living on biscuits and water for days and elderly people with no money to buy regular medicines.The Metiabruz Youth have reached out to 1,300 families over the past fortnight, giving each of them 5kg rice, 2kg wheat, 500gm dal, 2kg potatoes, 1kg onion, 2 packets of instant noodles, 1 bar of soap, 1 packet of oil and 1kg salt. Many broke down on receiving the kits. “What we are doing is a drop in the ocean. The poor are suffering and even if we  can reach to a few, we should do it,” said Noor Mahvish, a second-year law student.Every evening, the group draws up a list of people who need help. “We have tried to help people who have received no ration,” Noor said.The group has also visited lower middle-class homes  who are embarrassed to stand in queue to accept ration but are nearly starving because they have no livelihood. They met a “chacha” who has a roadside food cart and lives with his wife and two daughters and a widow who works as a house help and lives with an 18-year-old daughter. “Chacha started crying. This is why we don’t want to take photographs while we are distributing the ration because we do not want to embarrass them,” Noor said.“The daughter of the help had a stove accident and suffered burns before the lockdown. Her mother was also injured trying to save her. they had no food for four days,” said Asif Ali, a graduate.The boys and girls have approached their friends and families for help, even pleading with them in some cases. “Nobody refused.

339,TT Bureau,Always remember people like him: Mamata Banerjee - Telegraph India,"Mamata Banerjee on Friday talked about an octogenarian who donated Rs 10,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to stress the importance of “positive things” amid the Covid-19 crisis.“Many can help with money. But remember, many can help with heart…. I have seen pictures. An 82-year-old man, a retired teacher, stepped out of his home to call police,” she said during the news conference at Nabanna.“The police had thought he wanted food. The man, at this age, had stepped out to hand a Rs 10,000 cheque to the cops, asking them to deposit it in the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. I had called the gentleman two-three times. He must have missed the calls, perhaps he was resting then. But I always remember people like him. You also keep them in mind. Let such positive things happen for the sake of peace. People don’t want to see negative stuff all the time.”On April 12, The Telegraph had reported how Subhash Chandra Banerjee, a retired college teacher in Dum Dum, had called out the cops a day earlier. The policemen, part of a patrol from the Airport police station in the Bidhannagar commissionerate, thought he was hungry but were surprised when he wrote out a cheque for Rs 10,000 in favour of the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to help in the fight against Covid-19.Banerjee was surprised on Friday afternoon when a policeman rang the doorbell and asked him to switch on his mobile phone.A few minutes later, he received a call. The caller identified himself as an officer of the police station and told him that the chief minister had tried calling him but could not get through to him and was likely to call him again.Although he has been receiving several calls from former students and colleagues, Banerjee said he had never expected the chief minister to call him.“I was resting so I must have missed her calls. I had made a very small contribution. She (Mamata Banerjee) must be extremely busy and it does feel good that she thought of me even though hundreds of others are doing so much more than what I have done,” he said.A former teacher of Dinabandhu Mahavidyalaya, Banerjee said he remembered the time when Mamata had visited Bongaon in North 24-Paraganas and delivered a speech on the town hall ground when he was still a teacher at the college.The former teacher requested everyone to step forward and help each other in their own capacities.",2020-04-17 21:33:00
340,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus lockdown: State board tweaks check rules - Telegraph India,"A single set of examiners will check Madhyamik answer scripts twice this time.The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has asked examiners doing the first round of evaluation to recheck the papers to do away with the need for a second set of examiners.The decision to get the papers examined twice by the same group of examiners has been taken to save time and avoid delay in publication of the results, Kalyanmoy Ganguly, the board president, said on Friday.“We have asked the examiners to check the papers twice to skip the second round of evaluation by another group of examiners. This way we can save time and expedite the process of publishing the results,” he said.The Madhyamik results are generally declared between the second and third weeks of May.The process of publication of the results has been delayed because of the lockdown.A government official had recently called up board officials to enquire about the status of the results.Madhaymik answer scripts are examined by two sets of examiners every year. After the second round of checking, the papers are randomly scrutinised by head examiners.The random scrutiny of answer scripts will be held like every year, board president Ganguly said.The answer scripts are now with the examiners who have been assigned to do the first round of evaluation.This year, 10,15,888 students took the exams that started on February 18 and ended on February 27.The board had completed the process of distributing answer scripts to examiners before the Centre announced the lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.According to the prevalent system, after the first round of evaluation, examiners submit the answer scripts to head examiners who distribute them to the second set of examiners.On completion of the second round of evaluation, the papers are randomly scrutinised by head examiners to ensure there is no mistake in the evaluation after the recheck by the second group.After the scrutiny, head examiners deposit the papers to the board, which then tabulates and prepares the results.The results are generally declared at least six weeks after the submission of the papers by head examiners to the board.",2020-04-17 21:37:00
341,Sudeshna Banerjee,"Coronavirus lockdown: Germany, Punjabee Bradree and NGO help in Kolkata - Telegraph India","The German consulate in the city has tied up with two local outfits to provide food to the hungry and protective gear to frontline workers.On Thursday morning, German deputy consul general Jurgen Thomas Schrod was at Punjabee Bradree in Ballygunge where the day’s lunch was being cooked in the kitchen. In the hall on the ground floor, tables were laid out in rows. Volunteers first placed butter paper sheets, putting  four rotis and alu sabzi on each, then another batch wrapped them to be placed in containers, to meet the requisitions of 20 police stations. As the clock ticked on, men in uniform walked in to collect the lunch boxes to be distributed among the unfed. “We started work on the first day of the lockdown. While we could feed 180 mouths on Day 1, today we have scaled up to 15,000,” said Pankaj Maloo, of Active Citizens Together for Sustainability (ACTS).The consulate on Tuesday signed a contract with the NGO Switch On Foundation and the forum ACTS. “Our grant of about Euro 8,500 is for three kinds of action — providing food ration to the needy, distributing masks to the police, and face guards, sanitisers and gloves to frontline  workers,” said Schrod. “We provide kitchen and manpower. The police are helping with the distribution,” said Ashok Arora, general secretary of Punjabee Bradree.Twenty police stations are picking up the packets, with Port requiring the highest number — 500. Next are Lake and Kalighat police stations, requiring 300 packets.Among the beneficiaries was a group of 25 huddled under the AJC Bose Road flyover. “We are rag-pickers. Some of us work as sweepers. Now we have no work. These people give us food everyday,” smiled a woman with matted locks as the police made them queue up maintaining social distancing for distribution.",2020-04-17 21:42:00

So this is not new for me. Yes, friends have stopped coming. Yes, I am chatting with them over phone or video chat but that doesn’t make up for the lack of their physical presence. But the entire family is home — my elder brother, boudi, nieces, aunt, my dogs...I am also doing my usual chores of composing, singing, drawing... I am doing a series of cartoons on coronavirus. We have a group of cartoonists called Cartoon Dal, to which many of us are contributing.My generation has not seen anything like this nor have I heard my aunt or my father speak about such a pandemic. Yes, they spoke of World War II. Yes, cholera is said to have taken out entire villages but never a disease that took the entire world down on its knees.I am getting tired of news. The first few days I was tracking headlines with the hope of a positive turn. But it’s only getting worse so I am avoiding Covid-19 developments altogether.My dogs are all from the street. They stay in our driveway. They have bitter rivalry with another gang staying just across the street which cannot approach because of them.I am not doing live sessions on Facebook simply because too many are doing it. Perhaps more people are singing or reciting than there are listening. So I have decided to be among the listeners. I heard Rupankar and Annie Ahmed do live sessions the other day.Swagatalakshmi DasguptaSinger-composerResident of: Vidyasagar NiketanSpending time: I am doing double shifts — one for myself, the artiste, and the other as the domestic help, who is absent. Of course I am missing the company of the students of my music school Ashokrenu. But I am being being positive, staying in the company of my pet cat Puan.I have started uploading a song daily on YouTube. It started with Krishnadi (Chakraborty, the mayor) asking me to sing Annapurna stotra for the puja at her place recently. That set me on this course to record something positive daily. I have a recording studio at home which I call Puan Recording Studio. It is so well-equipped that music companies have used recordings I have done here. So far, I have done a variety of songs —Surya vandana, prayer songs like Ami andhakarer yatri, a Bengali version of John Lennon’s Imagine, I have confidence from The Sound of Music... The last song, in fact, is shot totally on Puan. I take a lot of pictures of her with which I hold annual exhibitions. My only concern in this lockdown period is whether I can supply her quota of fish daily. I don’t mind surviving on muri-chide-jol myself. I have come out of a major ailment a year and half ago and doctors have asked me not to venture out of home even before the lockdown was announced.",2020-04-18 06:28:00
343,Sudeshna Banerjee And Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus lockdown: Lack of material halts mask production - Telegraph India,"With the state government making it mandatory to wear a mask in Bengal, the requirement for masks has seen a rise. Though there are enough hands ready to ply the sewing machines, supply of cloth is proving to be a major hurdle.Roshanara Bibi, who belongs to a seven-member self-help group in Chandpur, in Rajarhat, has received orders for two consignments of masks ever since the lockdown started. “Before that, we used to make churidar, nightie and blouse. The first masks I made were for children at home. A client saw it and took it as sample. On the basis of that, I was given 198m cloth. We made 850 three-ply masks out of that. The next lot was 1,000m. That yielded 4,700 masks.” She alone made 450 masks.But now many of them are sitting idle as material is hard to come by. “Give us cloth. We are ready to make masks,” she tells a customer from New Town.Prayasam, a CG Block-based NGO, runs an upcycling unit called Duoranir Sansar, which collects used clothes from people and makes them worthy of reuse. “When the lockdown started, we started making handkerchiefs with straps using these clothes to distribute among the youths who work with us. We must have made around 1,000 face covers.”Now they still have some material in their clothes godown in Dum Dum. “But our boys who run the unit are unable to get out of their areas because of strict policing ever since the lockdown was extended,” said Prayasam founder Amlan Ganguly. “If we could access the material, we could get our tailors to work from home in our Gouranganagar, New Town.”Stylist Tailor is one outfit where material is still at hand. “I had bought enough in advance anticipating demand,” says owner Monika Khandelwal. She owns a tailoring shop in New Town Market in Action Area 1 and had turned it into a full-time mask-making centre in pandemic season. “We are getting so many bulk orders for masks that we are not making blouse or salwar kameezes any more,” she had told The Telegraph on March 27, in the first week of lockdown.She owns two stalls. One is where she used to sit wearing a mask, which drew customer attention. The second stall was diametrically opposite it, where two tailors made masks from cashmed cloth. A metre of the cloth is producing 10 to 12 such masks. “We are keeping about Rs 25 as labour charge and selling at around Rs 35,” she had said then.But once the initial orders dried out she had sent her tailors home. Recently with masks becoming mandatory in Bengal, she got orders for another consignment.“Only I know how one tailor could come back, hitching a ride from his Sundarban village on a vegetable van and landing at Biswa Bangla Gate crossing at 1am from where he walked to our Kestopur factory.” Now the New Town Market stall has had to shut but the tailor is carrying on at the Kestopur factory.An EE Block-based souvenir company is still making masks but does not have the logistics to deliver them home yet.It all started three days before the lockdown when Somwrita Guha, founder of Papercup, sent her building’s caretaker to buy masks for her parents. “Not only were they not easily available, but when he did source them from Kestopur, he was charged an astronomical Rs 60 a piece,” says Guha.Masks were never part of Papercup’s product line but they decided to make them as it was the need of the hour. “We got orders for about 800 three-ply masks in 48 hours but the lockdown made it difficult to deliver them. Some customers picked them up from the homes of our tailors in Budge Budge,” she says.Papercup is still getting orders. Raw material is limited but they are working around the problem. “Since the government announced that any kind of protection over the nose and mouth will qualify as mask, we have started folding a single layer of cloth to make them instead of three-ply. If demand persists we may rope in more tailors living around our employees and ask them to stitch masks using saris, kurtis etc,” Guha says. She is now trying to arrange a vehicle permit so she can pick up the masks from Budge Budge.Bishnu Chenani, a CK Block resident who runs Bhaskar Textiles in Madhyamgram, had diverted material from making capris and Bermuda shorts to masks right before the lockdown. “It was the need of the hour. We made 4,000 masks and donated some to clubs in Madhyamgram. The rest are being distributed free of cost to neighbours on behalf of CK-CL Block association,” says Chenani.Chenani has material at his factory, tailors living nearby and is keen to make more masks but is unable to do so due to the lockdown. “If I get definite orders I shall approach the authorities to allow me to reopen the factory,” he says. “In fact, we shall start making masks commercially henceforth, keeping prices nominal. The industry has been badly hit and demand for masks will sustain for at least a year now.”",2020-04-18 06:28:00
345,Debraj Mitra,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Early to fly, kites take Calcutta back to childhood - Telegraph India","Kites have made an earlier-than-usual appearance in the Calcutta skyline because of the lockdown.The “kite season” usually starts around Independence Day and lasts a few days beyond Vishwakarma Puja. But the colourful diamond shaped objects are dotting the skyline for over three weeks now.The shutdown has opened an unexpected window for kite lovers to indulge in their favourite sport from the terrace.As the afternoon sun starts receding, the colourful kites start appearing in the sky. The numbers are more in north Calcutta but south also has its share of kite lovers, who rush to the terrace for their favourite sport.“It seems reliving childhood once more. This is probably the only positive of the lockdown. I am not the only one. The sky in our area has a number of kites in the afternoon,” said Shirshendu Dutta, a 35-year-old kite aficionado in Cossipore, in north Calcutta.Dutta had bought several dozens of kites and several thousand yards of string before the “season” last year. Over 30 kites were lying unused. “I had thought these would be used during Vishwakarma Puja this year. But for the past 20 days, I have been flying kites for close to two hours every day,” said Dutta, a businessman, who takes part in kite-flying competitions in winter.Now, his companion who holds the kite reel is his six-year-old son, Traigunya. “He is also locked up like me. He needs some fresh air and enjoys the kite-flying session,” said Dutta.The kite shops are not open. People are using the leftover stock from last year.Dutta’s friend Suvendu Sarkar, a Baranagar resident, is also passionate about kites. But he had “completely forgotten that at least two dozen kites and 3,000 yards of string were left from last year’s stock”.Till three days into the lockdown. “I saw a kite in the sky. It was like my eureka moment,” he told Metro. Since then, he has been flying kites for over an hour every day.“I am having tense duels in the sky with other kite lovers. An hour or two just flies by,” he said.South Calcutta has also been seeing a substantial number of kites. Priyangshu Das Bakshi, appearing for his higher secondary exams this year, has had the test deferred because of the lockdown. “I had bought two dozens kites last year. Around 10 remained from the stock. I have been flying one or two every day,” the Kasba boy said.The teenager has his afternoons packed with private tuitions under normal circumstances. He also goes to a cricket coaching camp two days a week. But the lockdown has indefinitely placed a bar on private tuitions and cricket camps.

346,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: Barricades and combat force at work across Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Many people across the city on Saturday tried to come out on the roads sneaking through the barricades that police had installed a day before to keep them off the thoroughfares. Combat force personnel were deployed in many of these locations later in the afternoon to ensure no one stepped out.The barricades, however, visibly reduced traffic on the roads on Saturday.Metro spotted breaches at some of the locations that had been sealed on Friday to prevent movement of pedestrians and vehicles on the thoroughfares.Narkeldanga, Chetla Hat Road, Belgachhia and Rajabazar were some of the places where barricades were moved and displaced for making way for pedestrians.However, at places such as VIP Bazar, Picnic Garden and Bhowanipore’s Puddapukur, the police vigil had prevented people from violating the lockdown.“We are not allowing any vehicle to pass through unless it is related to emergency services,” said an officer posted at VIP Bazaar, while allowing a car carrying a doctor going to work to pass.Similarly, a motorcyclist who claimed to be a civic body employee but could not produce any document supporting his claim was not allowed inside Puddapukur despite repeated requests. Residents had teamed up in Puddapukur to guard the barricades, along with cops from Bhowanipore police station.Violations were visible near Narkeldanga and Rajabazar as people were seen coming out through narrow gaps between two guardrails. On some stretches such as  Chetla Hat Road, a guardrail was moved off the carriageway to ensure free movement of pedestrians.“Barricading was only a part of the implementation plan. Combat forces were deployed today at sensitive locations, from where (Covid-19) cases or a large number of lockdown violations have been reported,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.Each of the nine divisions were given six to eight combat force personnel for route marches and deployment in the areas considered “sensitive”. The combat battalion of the Calcutta police specialises in securing “vulnerable assets” and manning the 13 quick response teams. Vulnerable assets include sensitive areas such as New Market and Park Street and sensitive points such as vital installations.However, unlike their normal duty protocol, the combat personnel, who are trained in manual combat and have the strength to counter multiple opponents, are being deployed without firearms.“Their presence on the roads is meant to create mental blockade in the minds of the people. Residents would think twice before stepping out on the road if they see that some men with batons in hand are standing right outside. It would be a deterrent,” an officer said.The combat forces marched through pockets of Park Circus, Ripon Street, Panchasayar, stretches in the Port area and pockets of the eastern suburban division.Sources at Lalbazar said extra deployment was made at 56 market areas in the city that attract maximum crowds during the day. Drones were used to monitor densely populated areas.Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma and other senior officers of the force visited Garden Reach police station on Saturday, a day after a senior officer posted there tested positive for Covid-19.",2020-04-18 21:16:00
347,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Howrah teen fights woes to help others  - Telegraph India,"A 14-year-old girl whose father is a migrant labourer stuck in Odisha and family does not have enough to eat has been trying to help others in her neighbourhood in Howrah’s Bagnan. Among the persons Sumana Pal helped is an elderly woman, for whom she fetched  medicines, and a couple who got free ration arranged by a study centre because of her intervention.The teenager tries to reach out to those in the neighbourhood who need help and has also coaxed her teacher into supporting such families. The teacher, Tanmoy Patra, is paying for the ration for 100-odd families in Bagnan.Patra, a private tutor, had founded the study centre in Bagnan, Howrah Vivekananda Siksha Kendra, for students in nearby villages who go to government schools.Most of the families that get Patra’s help have daily wage labourers, landless farmers and van-pullers as their earning members. Some used to work in hotels in Calcutta. “We have decided to help them for a few months because even after the lockdown is lifted, many of them would find it difficult to earn. With nothing to eat, they will be forced to make their children quit studies and send them to work. We can’t let that happen,” said Patra. Sumana’s family — the teenager shares a one-room house with mother Anita and brother Suman, an HS examinee — is subsisting on ration provided by Siksha Kendra. But even during the lockdown and uncertainty, Sumana visited the elderly woman to find out how she was managing.“The aged woman lives with her son, who has some mental illness. I went to their house because I suspected they were facing some problems…. I came to know that she hadn’t been able to buy medicines to control her blood pressure,” said Sumana.The Class IX student then called up Patra and asked for money to buy medicines. “I did not have the money. But I arranged for it and could buy some medicines for the lady,” the teenager said. Sumana’s father, Nitai, works at a furniture workshop in Berhampur in Odisha and is still stuck there. Her mother makes wire chains in the house and earns Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 a month.“We don’t know when and how he will come back. The owner of the workshop is giving them food and shelter but if this continues for long, we don’t know what will happen. I have not been earning since the lockdown started,” said Anita. Following Sumana’s requests, Vivekananda Siksha Kendra has been distributing ration to a number of families in the area. “She asked us to give them some ration because they have nothing to eat. In fact, she finds out about them and alerts us about their condition,” Patra said.Funded by well-wishers, Siksha Kendra has distributed ration twice and the third round will start soon. Suman and other students of the area have formed a group and are taking turns in visiting homes to distribute vegetables and groceries. “We go back to the same families to enquire how long their ration will last,” said Sumana.",2020-04-18 21:16:00
348,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown: NGO and cops hand out pads in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A group of women volunteers crisscrossed the city handing out packets of sanitary napkins to underprivileged women, who have lost their livelihood because of the lockdown. The women who received the packets were household help, daily wage labourers and pavement-dwellers in different parts of the city.The drive was undertaken by the Calcutta chapter of ActionAid India, an organisation that works for women and children, and Calcutta police. Volunteers accompanied by the police started out from Poddar Court distributing  sanitary napkin packets to women who live on pavements. They then went to a cluster of tenements near the Kolkata Improvement Trust building. Packets were also distributed in the Bagbazar area. The volunteers who distributed the packets wore masks and gloves and carried hand sanitisers. Rudrani Dasgupta, programme officer of ActionAid Calcutta, said they undertook the drive as menstrual hygiene for these women had taken a backseat because they were facing a severe financial crisis. It was to help the women who now have to make a choice between buying sanitary items and feeding their family, she said. “These women are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Nearly all of them are not getting any wages because they are unable to go to work but have mouths to feed back home. This is the reason we decided to distribute the sanitary pads because this is one of the first items that they curtail to save some money,” Dasgupta said.Rina Thakur, a resident of Bagbazar who also works with the NGO, said: “Most of my neighbours work as household help and we have very little money left with us. The packets will help all of us a great deal.”",2020-04-18 21:17:00
349,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Lockdown hits home medical care - Telegraph India,"Hundreds of elderly Calcuttans and those suffering from chronic medical conditions are finding it difficult to get everyday medical assistance because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus, said doctors, hospital authorities and organisations providing home care.The daily medical assistance include checking blood pressure and blood glucose level, and administering insulin and injections.Assistants at local pharmaceutical stores, popularly called “compounders”, are not available at most places, while most private hospitals have stopped sending their personnel to houses to collect samples as a precautionary measure to protect their staff from the virus. Health-care experts said that because of these two factors, many people suffering from diabetes, renal ailments, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other diseases are finding it difficult to get their conditions monitored regularly or the medical support they used to get readily before the lockdown kicked in. Manoj Debnath, 59, a resident of Bhowanipore, is diabetic for many years and recently underwent amputation of his right leg below the knee because of gangrene.“My father is bed-ridden and needs physiotherapy. But now I am not getting any physiotherapist. I had approached the hospital where he underwent the surgery but they failed to provide one,” said Abahan,  Debnath’s son.Debnath, the headmaster of a local school, would also get his blood glucose level examined by an assistant at a local medicine shop. But that person has gone back to his village because of the lockdown, said the son.“I have purchased a machine to measure the blood glucose level but my father needs his blood pressure checked, too. There is no one to do it,” said Abahan.A 73-year-old woman living in Kasba needs an injection to be administered every 10 days, which keeps her haemoglobin level normal. “My mother is diabetic and her kidney is affected, too. She does not need dialysis. Doctors said the injection can boost the heamoglobin level so that the vital organs are not further damaged. But the man who administers the injection is not available now,” said her daughter. The doctor has told her to wait till the lockdown is over.“These medical store assistants are lifesavers for thousands of people in Calcutta. Their absence has made these people helpless. Many of them are reluctant to go to hospital because they are scared of getting infected by the coronavirus. So, nebulisation for patients suffering from COPD, or setting up oxygen cylinders, dressing of wounds, administering intra-muscular injections and checking blood pressure are seriously affected,” said Rahul Jain, internal medicine specialist. Jain said many elderly people, who stay alone because their children work in other cities, are wary of taking insulin or getting blood pressure and blood glucose level by themselves. “We are trying to guide them through video calls and sending them links. But still many are scared to do these on their own,” he said.The CEO of a private hospital in south Calcutta said they were getting calls from people who have fever or other ailments like urinary tract infection and need to get the complete blood count test done.“Two of my employees in the sample collection department have been quarantined at home after they went to collect blood samples of a person who later tested positive for Covid-19. So, we have stopped sample collectors from visiting houses,” said the CEO.Many other hospitals have taken similar steps.“We are asking people to come to our hospital and get check-ups done because there are no Covid-19 patients admitted here. But many people still don’t want to come,” said a senior official of another private hospital.There are organisations providing home care for such people but the numbers covered are not enough, said health-care experts. But these organisations are also receiving much more calls than usual.“Apart from usual help like assisting them to go to the banks, we are getting calls from panicked elderly people staying alone who are seeking assistance for nebulisation or getting emergency medicines which they can’t procure from local medicine stores,” said Mou Roy, one of the directors of Rising Care, an organisation that provides assistance for elderly people.Roy said she got a call from an elderly man staying in Chandernagore who sought assistance to go to a ration shop. “The man said he had sent someone to the ration shop but the man there insisted that the ration card-holder had to be there in person. We don’t have anyone there, so I asked him to call police for help,” she said.Another problem faced by home-care providers is resistance from many residents in apartment complexes.“Many of our care providers are being stopped by residents of these housing complexes who are demanding fitness certificates for Covid-19. But we can’t get Covid-19 tests done for our care-givers who have no such symptoms. This is affecting our care delivery system,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, unit head, eastern India, Apollo Homecare.",2020-04-18 21:17:00
350,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus outbreak: JU and CU on mask overdrive - Telegraph India,"Teachers, students and researchers at Jadavpur and Calcutta universities have gone on an overdrive to produce masks at a time the Bengal government has made it mandatory to cover one’s face before stepping out.The Telegraph takes stock of the drive on the two campuses.Jadavpur University  At Jadavpur University, teachers and researchers have developed a three-layer washable mask from low-cost, easily available materials.Through a platform called “People’s Initiative for Technology”, 500 masks are being produced daily with the help of tailors in the area.A professor of mechanical engineering, who is supervising the process, said the masks are being made using materials available at homes. Of the three layers of a mask, the two outer layers are made of polypropylene fabric. This type of fabric is used to make the carry bags that have been introduced to replace the plastic ones.“One can easily procure such materials,” said Swarnendu Sen, the teacher who is overseeing the project.Hindol Majumder, a research scholar, said the inner layer is of cotton. “The outer layer material is of hydrophobic nature that repels water. The inner layer is hydrophilic, which soaks the water coming up to this layer,” he said.The university on its website www.jad.univ.edu.in has uploaded a video link, describing the procedure to prepare masks.How effective are the masks? Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya, a professor of chemical engineering, said droplets generated from sneeze or cough have been simulated through sprinkling of water from a close distance to test the efficacy. “The sprinkled droplets crossed the first polypropylene layer but were absorbed by the cotton layer. The second polypropylene layer is not getting wet by the droplets,” he said.“Once bulk production starts, the university will make the masks available to the underprivileged for free,” said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das. Calcutta UniversityThe jute and fibre technology department of Calcutta University, too, is making three-layer masks.“Our faculty members of the department are producing masks as there is a shortage of those in the market,” said vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee.Two layers of cotton and a thin layer of polyester are being used in the masks, which will be washable.The items are being given to the state government for free for distribution among the people,  she said.",2020-04-18 21:17:00
352,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Pension sum to help feed kids - Telegraph India,"A 70-year-old retired schoolteacher has given Rs 20,000 to a study centre for underprivileged children in Howrah to provide them and their families with food during the lockdown.Sankar Prasad Hore who lives alone in an apartment in New Town has kept Rs 9,000 and “something” for his own expenses from the “Rs 29,000 and a few hundred” he received as pension this month.The children at Howrah Vivekananda Siksha Kendra in Bagnan are mostly first-generation learners from nearby villages. “These children and their families need food to survive and we have to help them live through this crisis… Rs 10,000 is enough for my monthly expenses,” Hore said.Hore was the chemistry teacher of the school’s founder Tanmoy Patra. The retired teacher has helped the study centre financially as well as by giving chemistry lessons to students.“When the lockdown started our first concern was to provide food to families of the children. Sir came forward within a few days and gave Rs 20,000… he said we have to help them for some months now till their income is regularised... he has always been like this… he took the first step for others to be inspired and to follow him,” Patra said.Hore listed his own monthly expense as Rs 3,000 for the domestic help and another Rs 2,000-2,500 for food in a month.Parents of the children are mostly daily labourers, rickshaw-pullers, brick kiln workers or landless farmers, he said. “In many of these families, the man is the sole earner and his earning is wasted in addictions… it is mostly the mothers who run the family… they don’t have any savings. If we don’t support them now they will be ruined. Despite their background, many of the children score 80-85 per cent in exams… some even 90 per cent…. We cannot let them die of hunger.”Hore retired from Garden Reach Nut Behari Das Boys High School in 2009 after teaching chemistry for more than three decades. “While teaching these children I am relearning chemistry,” he said.His association with the Howrah school began about five years ago when his student Patra from the 1987 HS batch took him to this centre as his mentor. “I was touched,” Hore said. Since then, he has been giving anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 every month for the school’s children.Patra had founded the school in 2010.“I have no liabilities. My students do tell me to keep something aside for any kind of crisis, especially any health need,” Hore said.But helping students is his old habit. He had supported many children when he was a teacher at the Garden Reach school. “I helped them with something.”But his student Patra has a different take. “We knew his salary would be over by the 15th of every month because he was helping many students continue with their studies; some with their engineering courses because they could not afford it.”",2020-04-19 20:31:00
353,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya,Coronavirus Lockdown: Bindi man to Samaritan - Telegraph India,"All that glitters is not gold. But imitation gold can offer a good livelihood. And when that fails, there is plain good work.Bijoy Roy, 47, used to run a small but busy roadside imitation gold shop on Rasbehari Avenue, close to Fern Hotel, a few metres away from where Bijon Setu slopes up. Roy, whose family   was originally from Bihar, but who is only mistaken for a Bengali now, took over from his father as a boy of around 15, in the late Eighties. The shop sold biscuits and bottled drinks then.But the young Roy, who had studied till Class VII in La Maternelle school in the Gariahat area, was not interested in such stuff. In four years or so — “the year Babri Masjid happened” — he converted the shop into something more glamourous. And lucrative.He began to sell cosmetics and imitation jewellery. But his forte was the bindi.Roy, a genial man of medium build, who is also a resident of the area, and a popular one, became well known for his brand of decorative bindis through the Nineties, the post-liberalisation years when India began to dress up. Later, as the age of bling arrived, flashing in with some help from television serials and social media, and a new focus on the self, not to mention the selfie, Roy concentrated on cosmetic jewellery. Imitation gold to be precise.It was a good decision. Women flocked to his store. And so it went on, till recently.First came demonetisation. Then GST. And now Covid-19.“I shut my shop when the lockdown was declared. But business was already very bad by then,” says Roy, who lives very close to his shop with his family — his wife, three young sons and parents. His wife used to help him run the store. “Once my daily sales would go up to Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,500. I was very busy then. But by the time I closed shop, my sales had come down to Rs 200-300,” he says, standing on Rasbehari Avenue, close to his closed shop.He was beginning to feel worried. He has his family to look after and loans to repay. The lockdown was the final nail in the coffin.But then he found a way of being useful again, for which he is very glad.“After the lockdown, we heard that our ‘councillor madam’ was looking for volunteers to help carry supplies to households, especially to senior citizens in the area,” says Roy.Sudarshana Mukherjee, the councillor of ward 68 in Ballygunge area, of which Roy is a resident, has been working hard in the area, organising sanitation and supplies. She needed a team of volunteers to help her with it.Roy became one of the neighbourhood’s lifelines. His name was entered in the various WhatsApp groups the councillor has for the area. When a ward resident would want anything, the message would reach Roy fast. The request would be forwarded to the right team — there is one for medicines, another for groceries, etc — and all the neighbourhood shops would be looked up. Which leaves Roy very busy again.“I am out by 6.30am. First with the boys I go the market at Citizen’s Park and see if there is anyone needing any help. Then we start the work of reaching the supplies,” says Roy.One of his first jobs was to see why 11 bookings from the area for cooking gas — at the same dealer’s — were being ignored. He went into the outlet and sternly demanded an explanation. The cylinders were delivered promptly.“I was really angry,” says Roy.He feels happy when he is able to get something a senior citizen has asked for. He does not feel afraid. “What is there to fear? None of us feel afraid,” he says forcefully.What does he intend to do later?His past already looks distant. He remembers it wistfully.His bindis were the best in the market, in their quality, their original designs. “I had gone to Poush Mela in Santiniketan with the bindis for two-three years. They sold very well.” He had also become a distributor of the manufacturing company, Fashion Care. But it went bust.He also remembers how a drum-shaped mangalsutra sold during one Durga Puja — “the year the Bosepukur pandal was made of bhaand. I would sell 200 to 300 mangalsutras a day.”But he never just went for everything trendy. “I chose what looked good to me. I chose sensible stuff. I would never sell something that is trendy but offended my sensibility.” Wedding sets, going up to Rs 3,500, were available with him.He does not know what the future will bring. It looks like a mass of uncertainty.But as of now, he has a lot of work.",2020-04-19 20:32:00
354,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Antibody tests soon in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Rapid antibody blood tests for Covid-19 will soon be introduced in Bengal as a “surveillance tool”, the health department said  on Sunday.The rapid tests are likely to begin in the city on Monday or Tuesday, an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said. Blood samples would be collected instead of throat and nasal swab as is the practice in the existing tests for the coronavirus.Public health professionals warned that rapid tests are not confirmatory, but would help gauge how many in the community have been infected with the novel coronavirus. Rapid tests are done to identify if an antibody has developed in a person as a response mechanism against the novel coronavirus, public health experts said. The antibody would develop only when the person has been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and a positive result would thus confirm that s/he has been infected.Rapid tests would be conducted only in red zones, where containment measures have been adopted, the health department has said.The Telegraph spoke to experts to find out what are rapid tests and what purpose they serve. Who will do the tests?The Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (SSKM Hospital) would conduct the rapid tests in Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly and South 24-Parganas. The CMC would help conduct the tests in the city. It will pass on information about people with coronavirus-like symptoms collected from its door-to-door surveillance drive. “Medical personnel from SSKM would collect blood samples,” a CMC official said. The rapid test kitsThey are like strips on which the blood sample is dropped. The colour of the strip changes to indicate if the person has tested positive. The advantage is the results come within 30 minutes unlike the swab tests that take two days, said Shahid Jameel, a public health expert. Is  the test confirmatory?“If someone tests negative, it doesn’t necessarily mean the person is not infected,” said Jameel, the CEO of the Welcome Trust-DBT India Alliance. “A person with the virus would manifest the antibody only from the seventh day after being infected.”Why rapid tests?The test can be done at the doorstep. “It would have been best if we could do swab tests for community screening as well, but there is a shortage if kits for swab tests across the world. So even if India has money, it cannot buy the kits,” said the professional.",2020-04-19 20:42:00
355,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus Lockdown: Help a phone call away for the elderly in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A septuagenarian in Salt Lake, a diabetic for decades, ran out of her glucose test strips last week. None of the pharmacies she checked with had any in stock. A single phone call on Friday got her a set of 200 strips the next day.A retired college teacher needed to buy rice and pulses but with no rickshaws running she was worried how to carry the groceries from Lake Market to her Southern Avenue home. A call on Wednesday solved her problem and her groceries were delivered at her doorstep on Thursday.Doorstep delivery of essentials and medical assistance is just a call away for senior citizens in these testing times.The Telegraph Connect to Care, launched on April 14, is a support system for elderly Calcuttans during the lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus. Since the Poila Baisakh launch, hundreds of people have availed themselves of the service.The city has a large elderly population who live alone either by choice or because their sons and daughters live elsewhere. Confined to their homes because of the Covid-19 curbs, with transport options few and long queues at pharmacies and grocery stores, many of them have been finding it difficult to stock up on essentials.The campaign is aimed at making their lives easier, the organisers said.The groceries and other food items are being supplied by Spencer’s. Senior citizens can call at 7605084505, 7686994942 and 7604078954 between 10am and 4pm to place orders.Care Continuum, a home healthcare services provider, is in charge of medical assistance. The caregivers can be reached at 7044074000, from 8am to 8pm. “Elderly people with any medical requirement — medicine, doctor, therapy or any other requirement — can call us,” said a representative of the organisation.The phones have not stopped ringing  since the campaign was launched.Altu Brahma, 76, lives near Kwality bus stop in Salt Lake Sector IV. Her younger son lives near Swabhumi and elder son in the US. When Brahma ran out of glucose test strips last week, she called up several pharmacies in the vicinity. “But none had the strips. The stores had testing machines but without strips,” she said.Her younger son had also been scouting for the strips but with no luck. On Friday, he sent the Care Continuum helpline number to Brahma, who called up and spoke to a volunteer the same day.“A woman took the call. She was very polite and patient. She heard me out and sought some basic details. Less than 24 hours later, I got a set of 200 strips delivered at my home. I can’t thank the initiative enough,” said Brahma.“In these times, when we are all under siege by a virus, we felt that we could be a call away for those needing some medical help,” said Rana Mukherjee, managing director of Care Continuum.The organisation has been getting scores of calls every day. “We expect the numbers to go up. We are equipped to handle around 200 calls per day,” said another representative.Elderly people have had groceries, vegetables, fish and meat delivered at their homes across the city.Bhaswati Chakrabarti, 64, a retired college teacher who lives in Southern Avenue, is one of them. “I usually hire a rickshaw to carry the groceries home from Lake Market. I had bought the essentials before the lockdown but my stock was almost over by the middle of last week. There was no rickshaw that I could hire to go to the market,” she said.Chakrabarti got the helpline numbers from a WhatsApp group. She called Spencer’s on Wednesday and ordered rice, pulses, oil and breakfast cereals. The order was delivered on Thursday. “The service is prompt. It would have been difficult for me or my husband to walk till Lake Market and carry the groceries home,” she told Metro.“We have a home delivery app. But many senior citizens are not comfortable using apps. They would much rather call and place orders. This initiative would be help them. Since the launch, we have also had people, some from outside the state and the country, calling us up to place orders for their parents who live in Calcutta,” said Kaushik Ganguly, business head (east), Spencer’s. “The preferred mode of payment is card but we are also taking cash in unavoidable circumstances. The payment has to be made after delivery.”",2020-04-19 20:52:00
356,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Tests in Bengal yet to reach optimum level - Telegraph India,"Some of the Covid-19 test laboratories are conducting tests below their capacity and some have seen a drop in the average number of samples received in a  day, health department sources said.At least two test laboratories — one private and another government-run — have received fewer samples in the past few days. “The number of samples received has gone down to around 20 on an average over the past few days,” said an official of the private laboratory that had been conducting 70 to 89 tests a day till a week ago.The government-run laboratory is now testing around 80 samples a day, down from 100, sources said.The National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (Niced) has been conducting over 150 tests a day for the past few days, Shanta Dutta, the director of Niced, said. The laboratory is equipped to conduct 250 tests in a day.  “We are testing over 150 samples per day for the past few days.... We had tested 250 samples one day. That would be our maximum capacity to test in a day. We cannot test more than 250 samples in a day,” Dutta said.A Niced official said 169 samples were tested between Thursday and Friday and 160 samples were tested between Monday (April 13) and Wednesday (April 15).  The state, till Sunday, had the capacity to conduct approximately 600 tests a day but around 400 were being done because not enough samples were received, a health department official said.A senior government officials put the state’s testing capacity at “around 500-plus”. “But it takes time to reach the optimum capacity,” he added.Metro spoke to several officials of the health department and government hospitals and also with public health experts to find out the possible reasons for fewer samples being sent.Are test protocols being followed strictly?No, said a section of health officials and public health experts.In hot spots or clusters, people with flu-like symptoms — fever, cough, sore throat or runny nose — must be tested, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines state. This is besides all symptomatic contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid-19, all symptomatic health-care workers, all patients with symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) such as fever, cough or shortness of breath. Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of positive cases should also be tested between the fourth and fifth days of coming in contact with the infected person. Anyone with travel history must also be tested but this proportion is negligible now because of the ongoing lockdown, where domestic and international travel has stopped. The state government had said on Saturday that it has increased tests in the containment zones of Calcutta, Howrah, North 24-Parganas and East Midnapore.  But doctors at both government and private hospitals and clinics are not sending every person with mild symptoms of flu for Covid-19 test if they are outside the containment zones officials said.“There are some doctors and hospital officials who don’t seem to be clear about who to send for tests. In many cases, they are using their personal discretion,” said a senior health official. “Many of them feel people are not travelling because of the lockdown and so they are not sending residents if areas where cases have not been reported for tests even if they have flu-like symptoms.”“But we are trying to explain to these doctors that they have to follow the protocol. There is also some communication gap within the healthcare system and we need a uniform standard operating procedure that should be followed by all,” the official said.More people queuing up at the fever clinics of government and private hospitals should be sent for testing, another official said.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has started door-to-door surveillance to seek out anyone with fever.“We are sending reports to the health department and if they tell us to send someone for test, we are doing so,' a civic official said.Fear factorFear of being quarantined and social stigma was another reason for fewer people getting tested, health officials said.The number of people reporting at the fever clinics set up at government and private hospitals across the city and districts has either dropped or remained static.SSKM Hospital’s fever clinic has seen a drop from 120 people in the initial days of the lockdown to about 40 now, a hospital official said.At Belle Vue Clinic on Loudon Street, barely four people turn up in a day.Lack of transport because of the lockdown could also be another reason for people seeking doctor’s advice over phone instead of going to a clinic.More test centresThe number of Covid-19 testing centres has increased and state government officials said this could have resulted in distribution of the samples.“Earlier, samples from the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital were being sent to SSKM. But now, the School of Tropical Medicine is also conducting tests and so the samples from the Calcutta Medical College are being sent there,” a health department official said.But some officials argued more centres should mean more tests. “The problem is, all centres are not testing to their optimum capacity,” an official said.The state government has said initially 50 to 60 samples were being tested everyday. Now, the number has increased to 400 every day on an average.",2020-04-19 21:15:00
357,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: CCTVs in Calcutta to stop violations  - Telegraph India,"Jorasanko police station has installed CCTV cameras on congested stretches where barricades have been erected to keep people indoors.The move will ensure continuous vigil over places that have been sealed to prevent pedestrian and vehicle movement since Friday, police said.Cameras help in detecting crime and are a deterrent to crime. They will now act as deterrents to lockdown violators as well, an officer of the police station said.More than 70 cameras have been installed over the past few weeks on Zakaria Street,  Muktaram Babu Street, MM Burman Street, Tara Chand Dutta Street and in Mechhua bazaar, Balak Dutta lane, Munshi Sarauddin lane, and Ratu Sarkar Lane.“Some of the senior officers have remote access to the CCTV feed from the sealed roads. It will be easy to keep a watch through mobile phones,” an officer said.Some of these streets and lanes, including Zakaria Street, Tara Chand Dutta Street, M M Burman Street and Mechhua fruit market have been blocked with guardrails from Friday.The biggest challenge is to keep people and vehicles off roads. If people are seen loitering on roads or gathering outside their homes through CCTV cameras, officers will rush to the spot, an officer said. “Everyone should remain where they are. These containment areas need extra care because people are not allowed to step out of earmarked zones.”Till now, the police have used drones for aerial surveillance of congested areas, which have seen maximum lockdown violations or which have been marked as sensitive. Combat force personnel have been deployed at several locations to ensure the lockdown is not violated.This will possibly be the first time during the lockdown that cops are attempting to maintain continuous vigil on containment zones through CCTV cameras. Apart from the phones of some senior officers, the CCTV feed will be available at the police station, too.",2020-04-19 21:16:00
358,PTI," Covid-19 situation ‘especially serious’ in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Calcutta, Howrah, Darjeeling: home ministry - Telegraph India","The Centre has said the Covid-19 situation is 'especially serious' in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Calcutta and a few other places in West Bengal, and warned state governments that violation of lockdown measures risks the spread of the novel coronavirus further.The Union home ministry also announced that six inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs) would visit the identified areas in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan within the next three days for an on-the-spot assessment and recommend remedial measures to the Centre.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was among the first to react to the Centre’s move, saying that the basis on which the Centre had proposed to deploy its teams was 'unclear' and added 'we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism'.In identical orders issued to the four states on Sunday, the home ministry listed several violations that included incidents of violence against doctors and health care workers.The ministry said in some districts, a number of violations to the lockdown measures had been reported, posing a serious health hazard and risk for the spread of Covid-19 which include violations of social distancing norms outside banks, PDS shops and in market places, movement of private and commercial vehicles with passengers in urban areas and so on.“These incidents, if allowed to occur without any restraining measures in hotspot districts or emerging hotspots with large outbreaks or clusters, pose a serious health hazard, both for the population of these districts and for those living in other areas of the country,” the ministry said.After analysing the prevalence of such violations in major hotspot districts, it is clear to the central government that the situation is 'especially serious' in Mumbai and Pune (Maharashtra), Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Jaipur (Rajasthan), Calcutta, Howrah, East Midnapore, North 24-Parganas, Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri (West Bengal), the home ministry said.The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 543 and the number of cases climbed to 17,265 in the country on Monday, according to the Union health ministry.There are 4,203 confirmed cases in Maharashtra of which 223 people lost their lives. In Madhya Pradesh, out of the 1,407 cases, 70 people have succumbed to the disease.Rajasthan has reported 1,478 cases of which 14 people lost their lives. In West Bengal, there are 339 confirmed cases of which 12 people have died, according to health ministry data.After the government announced its decision to send teams, the Bengal chief minister tweeted, 'We welcome all constructive support & suggestions, especially from the Central Govt in negating the #Covid19 crisis. However, the basis on which Centre is proposing to deploy IMCTs in select districts across India including few in WB under Disaster Mgmt Act 2005 is unclear.''I urge both Honb'le Prime Minister @NarendraModi Ji & Home Minister @AmitShah Ji to share the criterion used for this. Until then I am afraid, we would not be able to move ahead on this as without valid reasons this might not be consistent with the spirit of federalism,' she added.The orders, signed by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, in his capacity as the chairperson of the National Executive Committee under the Disaster Management Act, also said the six inter-ministerial central teams would visit these hotspot areas and make on-spot assessment of the Covid-19 situation in these places and issue necessary directions to the four states.Civil aviation ministry arranging transportThe orders also made it clear that the ministry of civil aviation will provide air transportation, to and from, from New Delhi to their respective place of visit (nearest airport), as their deployment is for an essential purpose of ensuring compliance to the lockdown measures.The state governments will have to provide logistics support to the IMCT, for their accommodation, transportation, PPEs and extend all cooperation for their visits to local areas, production of documents and records as requested by the IMCTs.There have been several incidents of attacks on healthcare workers and police in various parts of the country, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, leading to injuries to doctors, paramedics and police personnel.The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 in a bid to combat the coronavirus pandemic. It was further extended till May 3. Six teams to focus on complianceThe teams, comprising five members each, will be headed by an additional secretary-rank officer of the central government.The six teams will make on-the-spot assessment of the situation, issue necessary directions to the state authorities for redressal of the situation, and submit their report to the central government in larger interest of general public.The IMCTs will focus their assessment on the compliance and implementation of lockdown measures besides issues like the supply of essential commodities, social distancing, hospital facility and sample statistics in the district, safety of health professionals, availability of test kits, PPEs, masks and other safety equipment, and conditions of the relief camps for labour and poor people.Later on Monday, joint secretary in the Union home ministry Punya Salila Srivastava said home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to the states afresh as some of them were issuing certain guidelines that amounted to 'diluting' the lockdown leading to 'severe repercussions to health' of the citizens.'MHA is regularly monitoring the lockdown situation in the country. Wherever lockdown is being violated we (MHA) are taking adequate action in coordination with state governments,' she said.“The purpose of the inter-ministerial teams is to provide support and assistance to the states in their endeavour to combat COVID-19,' she said.'The teams have been very carefully constituted so that support can be provided from health, administrative and disaster management aspects and I am sure states will benefit from it,' she added.",2020-04-20 13:29:00
359,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus Lockdown: State plea to UGC on exams - Telegraph India,"The state government has requested the University Grants Commission (UGC) to consult it before finalising how universities and colleges can hold the deferred undergraduate and postgraduate exams after the lockdown.Universities and colleges will have to regularise the postponed exams following a new set of guidelines, which will be issued by the UGC, the commission has recently said.The state government feels the Centre is attempting to curb its powers in framing its higher education policies by taking such a step, a higher education department official said.“...As education is on the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India, I would suggest that the report of the expert committee (constituted by the UGC to deliberate on the issues related to examinations and academic calendar) may be sent to all state governments, for suitable feedback within stipulated time period before any decision is taken on the report,” Manish Jain, the education department principal secretary, wrote to the UGC.“...It may be appreciated that non-consultation with the state governments before taking any decision on the report will be against the spirit of the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution.”The government suggested the commission send the report of its seven-member expert committee to it before implementing the recommendations of the committee.The UGC committee is examining the measures that need to be taken to resume the academic activities and examinations of universities and colleges in the country that have taken a hit because of the countrywide lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.In its directive, the UGC had said universities and colleges would have to chalk out a plan of action to hold the postponed exams after getting the commission’s guidelines.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had recently announced that the end-semester (fourth semester) undergraduate and postgraduate exams of universities would not be held this time.Universities will have to conduct only the last semester exams of final-year students, she had said.The state higher education department was supposed to issue an order for universities following her announcement so that they could chalk out their plans accordingly.But, the department cannot do so because of the UGC directive that was issued after the chief minister’s announcement.“The state government should be given suitable time for consultation with different stakeholders and discussion at the appropriate level in the government for sending their views on the report,” the state government has said in its letter to the UGC.The end-semester exams were scheduled to start from mid-April and continue till mid-June.",2020-04-20 20:49:00
360,Monalisa Chaudhuri,2 held for recording and sharing ‘hunger’ clip - Telegraph India,"Police have arrested two men for allegedly recording and circulating purportedly fake information in a video in which an elderly man was seen appealing to chief minister Mamata Banerjee to shoot him if her government failed to feed him during the lockdown.Police said the man in the video was a jatra actor.The video became viral after the BJP’s Twitter handle in Bengal posted it with a caption that suggested the man had not eaten for two days.The Telegraph reported on April 19 that Basirhat police had arrested the man in the video — Mobarek Mondal — and published another video that showed the same man saying that some youths in the locality had asked him to play the role of a starving man.The police also seized ration cards of at least five members of Mondal’s family and claimed the documents suggested that they were receiving ration from the government.Early on Monday, officers of Matia police station arrested Inamul Haque Sahaji, 32, and Kutubuddin Mondal, 25 — both residents of Begumpur, where the alleged incident had happened.“Kutubuddin had recorded the video and posted it on his Facebook wall. Inamul, who had got the video from someone else, had also posted it on his Facebook timeline. We are also looking for someone who posted the video in the YouTube,” said a senior officer of Basirhat police district.However, police are yet to zero in on the youths who according to Mondal had told him to act like a starving man.The accused have been booked under charges of violating the lockdown that could lead to a maximum punishment of two years in jail.",2020-04-20 20:59:00

The distribution will continue till April 30. Each student has been given a collection date.At Udaypur Haradayal Nag Adarsh Vidyalaya in Nimta on the northern fringes of the city, 176 out of 207 guardians who were to collect ration on Monday turned up. “Many guardians walked more than 10km to collect the ration,” headmaster Soumen Pal said.

Their other son is based in Canada.Roy said he was worried about the needy and the underprivileged. “Several plumbers, electricians, rickshaw-pullers and domestic help in my locality are faced with a tremendous financial crisis because they have lost their livelihood. Most have exhausted their savings completely. Everyone has needs and these people are the worst hit… they need food to survive. We cannot let people starve… all of us must step up and contribute in whatever way we can.”On April 12, The Telegraph had reported how Subhash Chandra Banerjee, a retired college teacher in Dum Dum, had called out police a day earlier. The policemen, part of a patrol from the Airport police station in the Bidhannagar commissionerate, thought he was hungry but were surprised when he wrote out a cheque for Rs 10,000 in favour of the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to help in the fight against Covid-19.On Monday, Roy and his wife called up a civic official and told him that they wanted to contribute something. Once the official landed up outside their house, Roy wrote out a cheque for Rs 10,001 in favour of the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Roy who has been staying in Salt Lake for more than 22 years said he could not “sit back at home and do nothing in this situation”. “We thought of several options but finally zeroed in on this. We are happy that we could contribute something,” Roy said. The money won’t affect their household budget, he said. “We will work our way round it. We always have. This is a time to step forward and help others… we could not sit at home and do nothing.”The AD Block is in Ward 41. Anindya Chatterjee, the ward councillor, said Roy had “always been like this”. “He has helped out residents as well as several helps in the block in the past.”Food and essential items will be distributed among the needy and migrants in AB, AC, AD, BB, BC and BD blocks later this week, Chatterjee said.",2020-04-20 21:20:00
363,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: Strict police step up Howrah vigil - Telegraph India,"Police had to forcibly send people home in several pockets of Howrah to enforce the lockdown on Monday.People stepping out of their homes, many with bank passbooks, were stopped. Residents chatting on the roads were chased by lathi-wielding cops and, in some cases, pushed back home.Howrah, declared a sensitive containment area, is one of the first places near Calcutta where Section 144 of CrPC had to be imposed to enforce the lockdown after multiple cases of Covid-19 were reported.Fresh barricades were set up on Monday to seal almost all lanes and bylanes leading to the major thoroughfares of Howrah.The cops had earlier sealed the roads to ensure people did not get a chance to leave the neighbourhood.“I woke up this morning, on hearing a lot of commotion outside my window. I looked out and saw two policemen on a bike beating up some boys who were chatting on the road. This has been the picture for the past few days. Earlier, a police jeep fitted with a loudhailer would do rounds of the area every day, appealing to people to stay indoors. People would step out the moment the jeep would leave. Now things have changed,” a resident of Salkia said.In another neighbourhood in Salkia, a resident said some youths had set up barricades on their own and put up posters with such appeals as “Please wear mask, do not step out of home, follow police’s instructions”.“But much to our surprise, the youths themselves used to sit behind the barricades and chat. The police have now removed those barricades and the youths were nowhere to be seen today,” the resident said.Senior officers of Howrah City Police said they had requested all banks in the area to remain shut during the lockdown as they were in the containment zone and many people had been carrying bank passbooks as an excuse to step out of their homes.Metro on Monday saw policemen stopping a scooterist carrying a bank slip at the Salkia Chowmatha. Stretches along Malipanchghara, Golabari, Shibpur, Howrah Maidan and Kajipara were sealed with bamboo barricades or flexible guardrails that were removed only for movement of police vehicles. Several pedestrians and motorists were refused entry and asked to take a detour even if they cited some emergency. Motorcyclists were stopped and forced to go home with a warning.Some youths on Belilious Road were made to hold their ears and apologise for stepping out of their home and violating the lockdown. “Since they are young, they were allowed to go with a warning. If we see them again, they will be prosecuted,” an officer of the Howrah traffic department said.The police said waving a baton towards the lockdown violators had a psychological impact even without having to beat anyone.",2020-04-20 21:51:00
364,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: Red zone and caution stall resumption - Telegraph India,"The city of Calcutta and most of its adjoining districts that have been marked as “containment zones” are beyond the scope of the lockdown exemptions that were being implemented from Monday.There was practically no change on the ground as Calcutta and its adjoining districts, including North 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly, are in red zones where no exemptions are to be made.Even the fringe areas that are not part of any red zone did not show any signs of change, mostly because of the reluctance of the private sectors to operate as a mark of precaution against Covid-19.The IT industry has been allowed to function with 50-per cent staff strength. But the Bidhannagar police —  the IT hubs in Salt Lake and Rajarhat fall under it — said they did not receive any request for allowing resumption of operations.The hubs are in the containment zone.“If any private company that comes under the exemption wants to start operations, it has to obtain permission from the chief secretary and then approach the police for consent. We did not get any such request till Monday evening,” said an officer of the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate.The notification issued by the ministry of home affairs mentioning the exemptions stated that from April 20, several private sectors — including the IT hubs and manufacturing units  — and self-employed personnel like plumbers, electricians and carpenters will be able to operate following the social distancing norms.  However, in another clause, it stated that the exemptions were applicable only to the places outside the containment zones. “We were hoping that maids and plumbers will be allowed to resume duty today. But when my plumber tried to come, he was stopped and sent back,” said an elderly resident of Bhowanipore.Police said a few changes were spotted only at some of the government offices where officers above the rank of deputy secretary were asked to join duty on Monday.In Calcutta, the number of prosecutions for violating the lockdown jumped from 150 on Sunday to 536 on Monday.“It appeared that many people had the misconception that exemptions were applicable in Calcutta too,” said an officer.Several IT personnel who have been working from home for the past month said they did not receive any communication to start working from office on Monday.The Bantala Leather Complex, despite being in the fringe areas that did not fall in the containment zone, remained non-operational on Monday.Realtors who have their projects on the fringe areas — both inside and outside the containment zones — said it would not be easy to start operations following all safety guidelines issued by the government even if there was an exemption from the lockdown.“Most of the real estate developers here do not have in-house labourers as has been prescribed by the home ministry. If we start bringing labourers now, there is no guarantee about their medical and travel history. Even when we bring labourers, we will quarantine them for 14 days for everyone’s safety. But that won’t be possible before the lockdown is over,” said a real estate developer who has his projects in places like Alipore, Madhyamgram, Rajarhat and Santiniketan.",2020-04-20 22:05:00

366,PTI,"Coronavirus: Central teams tour Calcutta, Jalpaiguri; Union home secretary asks state to cooperate - Telegraph India","One of the two central teams that have been sent to West Bengal to assess the Covid-19 situation in the state visited certain areas of the city on Tuesday, hours after it complained of non-cooperation from the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government.The team was escorted by Border Security Force (BSF) and state police personnel.The arrival of the two teams from Delhi without prior information on Monday had triggered a tussle between the Centre and the state government with chief minister complaining to the Prime Minister of “breach of protocol”. Banerjee said the team arrived in the state long before Union home minister telephoned informed her formally over the phone about their visit. While one team is in the city, another one is in Jalpaiguri district.The teams have been sent to review the implementation of an ongoing lockdown and take stock of the Covid-19 situation in Calcutta and some other parts of the state.In addition to West Bengal, inter-ministerial teams of the Union government have also been sent to Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation arising out of the coronavirus pandemic in these states.In Calcutta, the Central team was seen coming out of the BSF office around 4.45 pm. It then visited certain areas of the city.Apurva Chandra, the leader of the team who had claimed in the morning that they were told they 'will not be going out' during the day, was seen sitting in one of the cars. Bengal has seven districts on the team's watch-list. But the state government has claimed that three districts have not reported a single Covid-19 case in 14 days. The ruling Trinamul Congress has questioned the rationale of sending teams to the Bengal when no central teams were sent to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi that have a high number of Covid-19 cases. 'States are fighting the virus, the Centre is fighting against some states,' said Trinamool MP Derek O'Brien, accusing the central teams of 'adventure tourism' in Bengal.The Trinamool pointed out that Gujarat, ruled by the BJP, had seen a spike in Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks. The state has the third highest coronavirus cases in the country with 1,939. It has seen 71 deaths.Earlier in the day, talking to a news channel, Chandra, an additional secretary in the defence ministry, said, 'We have been deployed by the Centre and our order of deployment says the state government shall provide logistic support to us.... I have been in touch with the chief secretary and seeking his support since the time I landed here.'I met him on Monday. But on Tuesday, we were informed that there were some issues, so we will not be going out. The chief secretary is likely to visit us and we will again hold a meeting with him.'He said they had made it clear that they would be accompanied by state government officers in order to make their visit more productive.'But now, it has been more than a day and we have only visited the NICED (an ICMR facility) and the state secretariat,' Chandra said.State chief secretary Rajiva Sinha later clarified, 'The central team told us that it wants to visit parts of the city. We agreed and state government officials are accompanying the team.'Earlier on Tuesday, the Centre directed the West Bengal government not to obstruct the work of two central teams visiting the state.In a letter to chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said the West Bengal government was not cooperating with the central teams visiting the state to assess the ground situation and were specifically restraining members rom interacting with health workers and touring the affected areas.In a letter to chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said it has been brought to the notice of the ministry that the two inter-ministerial central teams, visiting Kolkata and Jalpaiguri, have not been provided with the requisite cooperation by the state and local authorities.Therefore, the union home secretary said, the state government “is directed to comply to make all necessary arrangements for the central teams to carry out such responsibilities as have been entrusted to them”",2020-04-21 15:03:00
367,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Ache over bid to club exams - Telegraph India,"The vice-chancellor of Rabindra Bharati University has written to the higher education department that a move to club two semester exams into one could burden many students.Last week, the higher education department had asked vice-chancellors if second/ fourth semester exams (end-semester) at the undergraduate level could be taken along with the third/fifth semester exams.“It is imperative to remember that the teaching-learning process in the annual pattern and choice-based credit system (CBCS)-based semester pattern is fundamentally different,” VC Sabyasachi Basu Raychaudhuri has written.“Clubbing of semester examinations will also impose a burden on students which most of them will be unable to cope with. Of course, there can be rescheduling of non-end semesters, ensuring minimum loss of academic time”.The proposal was floated in a videoconferenceon April 14  between education minister Partha Chatterejee and on undergraduate and postgraduate exams in the wake of the lockdown that has resulted in the shutdown of campuses till June 10.The end-semester exams for first-year and second-year students, scheduled for May-June, cannot be held because of the prevailing situation.It was proposed that the second/fourth semester exams be held with the third/fifth semester exams scheduled for December-January, to make up for lost time, a higher education department official said. “If the exams can be clubbed, we plan to keep a fortnight's gap between two semester exams,” said the official.VC Basu Raychaudhuri told Metro on Monday that all students were “not of equal merit”. “I feel a large section of students will be inconvenienced. I have suggested a few alternatives.”If that happens, three or a maximum of four more weeks may be allowed for classes and the semester-end exams can be held in July-August to ensure results are published by August-September, according to his letter.He told Metro that if this could be made possible, the non-end semester exams could be held on time without burdening students.In his letter he has said the non-end semesters exams can be rescheduled if Puja vacation is curtailed and classes are held on Saturdays. “The exam format can be modified to suit the interests of students and be in tune with the requirements of particular universities.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on April 15 announced that universities would have to conduct the last semester exams of final-year students (postgraduate as well as undergraduate). The dates would be decided later.Basu Raychaudhuri has proposed that the next academic session start from September 2020. “We may be able to adjust future academic sessions with a little more effort on our part. In fact, many leading institutions across the world are planning to do so.”All colleges and universities are likely to reopen by mid-June if the situation improves, he said.The Plus-II board exams cannot be held before June 10 this year; so, it will be sensible to start the session from September, he said.",2020-04-21 20:36:00
368,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Awareness roles are reversed for NCC girls - Telegraph India,"A school in Durgapur has distributed ration to 450 families living nearby, many of who were going hungry and some barely managing to feed their children during the lockdown.Guru Teg Bahadur Public School took the initiative after four senior students from NCC approached the principal with a request to provide food to families of daily wage earners, rickshaw-pullers and domestic help without any income at present.The four students of Class X — Banty Mondal, Sarbani Chakraborty, Swastika Prasad and Simran Singh —and their NCC teacher Spiti Sen toured six neighbourhoods in the city and its fringes over a week to spread awareness among residents about handwashing, precautions to take while coughing, social distancing and how to wear a mask when one steps out. During the visit, they came across many families who had barely anything to eat and did not know when the situation would improve.“The purpose of our visit was to make them aware of the coronavirus outbreak so that they follow the lockdown and maintain social distancing and personal hygiene. But while talking to them, we realised they were in a poor condition,” Mondal said.Sen said it was the girls who had taken the initiative. “We wanted the parents’ approval and we identified the areas where awareness is very low and used a school vehicle to commute,” the teacher said.After the girls approached the principal, the school decided to help  residents of one neighbourhood, about a kilometre from the school. Two cleaners hired by the school live in the locality.“The girls, with the help of the cleaners, identified the most needy families and gave them coupons. On Tuesday, they collected the ration,” said principal Sutapa Acharya.The school raised ration by appealing to students, ex-students,  teachers, trustees and friends. People pitched in with rice,  pulses, wheat flour and oil. “We accepted money only from ex-students. The rest contributed food items,” Acharya said.The families of 400 of the school’s 3,000 students and many ex-students came forward to help. The ration was distributed in the parking lot of the school on Tuesday. Each family received 2kg rice, 1kg potato, 500 grams pulses, a packet of salt and half litre oil.",2020-04-21 20:37:00
369,A Staff Reporter,Coconut tree kills mason in storm in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A 47-year-old man died after a coconut tree fell on him during the squall early on Tuesday, police said.Gagan Mondal, a mason by profession, had stepped out of his house in Tarulia on the outskirts of New Town to get a bottle of milk from a neighbouring cowshed when the tree was uprooted in the storm and fell on him, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.Mondal was less than 200m from his home when a strong gust of wind uprooted the tree and it fell on him, the officer said.“He was passing through a narrow lane lined with several trees when one of them got uprooted and fell on him,” the officer said.Mondal lay trapped under the tree for more than 20 minutes till a neighbour spotted him and alerted his family, the officer said. Some family members, along with a few neighbours, tried to pull him out but failed. “They then dialled 100, after which a police team reached the spot and brought him out from under the tree,” the officer said.Mondal was declared dead at a nearby government healthcare centre.“He was unconscious when he was brought in. He had suffered a head injury and lost a lot of blood. We could not revive him,” a doctor who had attended to him said.At least four trees, including the coconut tree that fell on Mondal, were uprooted in the storm, a Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation official said.",2020-04-21 20:37:00
370,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Papaya’s memory aids IIT workers  - Telegraph India,"IIT-Kharagpur alumni based in the US have reached out to help workers at their alma mater who have lost their livelihood because of the lockdown.The alumni have raised $2,42,000 (around Rs 1.86  crore) to help daily wage earners working at the eateries and tea shops on the campus, ward boys, washermen, rickshaw- pullers, domestic help and construction workers on the 2,100-acre campus rendered jobless by the lockdown.An estimated 10,500 people have been hit by the closure and the corpus is meant to help them, an IIT official said.Distribution of essential items such as rice, flour, toiletries and masks among the affected families, many of who live in nearby villages, began on Monday. Over the past two days, 225 people have been provided essentials, IIT Kharagpur registrar B.N. Singh said. “The distribution will be in phases. We are calling a few people at a time to maintain social distancing,” Singh said.The idea of creating the fund came from IIT old boy Vinod Gupta, who contributed $1,00,000 (around Rs 76 lakh)  to the corpus. A US-based entrepreneur, philanthropist and 1967-batch alumnus, Gupta has funded the management and law schools of IIT Kharagpur along with chair professorship.It was Gupta’s idea that help should be extended over a period of six months as the impact of the lockdown would be far-reaching, another IIT official said.“Activities at IIT Kharagpur revolve around the students, most of who have left the campus. Those who are still on the campus will go home once the lockdown is lifted. Then the summer vacation will start from May 10 and continue till mid-June. So the workers would have to suffer the impact for quite some time,” the official said.A corpus to the tune of Rs 8 crore would be required to keep helping such a large population for a period of six months, an official said.“The alumni community in the US hopes to raise about Rs 8 crore to help those facing hardships,” Gupta said. “When I took ill during my days at IIT, the guy who took care of me was the ward boy in Patel Hall and his name was Papaya. I still remember him.  It  (the help) just shows how important they have been in our lives.”The IITKGP Foundation in the US, led by president Ranbir Gupta, is running the fund-raising campaign. Among the alumni donors are Ranbir Gupta, Arjun Malhotra, R.N. Mukhija, Rakesh Gupta and over 100 donors from 1959 to 2017 batches.IIT Kharagpur director Virendra K. Tewari was present during the distribution of ration. Two bags containing 10kg rice, 5kg flour, 1kg pulse, 1 litre mustard oil, a packet of salt, 2kg potato, 1kg onion, a packet of turmeric, 1kg sugar, two packets of milk, four masks, detergent and handwash were handed out to each family.Director Tewari urged every “Kgpian” (IIT Kharagpur students) to support this noble cause.“This is the time to reminisce your days at the halls of residence and your adda at the night canteens and the faces who served you that cup of tea and bread,” he said.Tewari appreciated Gupta for taking the lead and creating this fund to help people who are facing hard times.",2020-04-21 20:38:00
371,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Need for more Covid-19 beds in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"More beds to treat Covid-19 patients and those with symptoms of the disease should be set up in and around Calcutta because the count of patients will increase with the number of tests going up, health department officials said.On Tuesday, 300 more Covid-19 tests were conducted across Bengal compared with Monday.Health officials and public health experts said more tests meant more positive cases and so more functional beds would be needed soon.A large number of the positive cases are expected to be from Calcutta, Howrah and North 24-Parganas, which have been identified as Covid-19 red zones.“The problem is a large number of people with Covid-19 symptoms who may not test positive are getting admitted,” said an official.Another reason that may lead to a shortage of beds in the event of a drastic jump in the number of positive cases is prolonged hospitalisation a Covid-19 patient requires — which stretches from 14 to 21 days.“The situation is often worsened by delays in getting the test results,” the official said.According to the state government's figures, Calcutta has more than 1,400 beds in four hospitals reserved for Covid-19 patients and those suffering from severe acute respiratory distress or having influenza-like symptoms.Of the four treatment centres, MR Bangur Hospital has 1,100 beds, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute's New Town unit has 192 beds, Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital has 82 beds and the annexe of AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake has 50 beds.Health department sources said that of the 1,100 beds at MR Bangur Hospital, only around 150 beds are “functional” — the ones that can be used for treatment. As of now, the rest cannot be put to use because of lack of infrastructure and personnel.“All 150 beds are full. Around 85 beds are being used to treat Covid-19 patients and the rest those who are having symptoms,” a source said.The Beleghata hospital is treating 44 Covid-19 patients. The hospital can only admit those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.“The annexe of AMRI Salt Lake is almost full and it's critical care unit is full, too,” a source at the hospital said.Health department officials said it was time to make ready more beds because the rise in the number of beds would lead to more positive cases.On Tuesday, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said 713 tests were conducted during the day. The average daily count till Monday was around 400.Metro has reported that the Covid-19 testing centres were not being utilised to their capacity, much against the advice of public health professionals.New test facilities have come up at the Malda Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and CNCI.Till Tuesday, 6,182 tests have been conducted, Sinha said. “Since the gamut of tests is being widened, we are expecting the number of positive cases to rise. Then we need to have more functional beds at MR Bangur hospital,” said an official.He said there was a need for more beds that have critical care facilities like ventilators and dialysis units. A state government official, however, claimed that all 1,100 beds at MR Bangur were functional. But he refused to say how many patients were admitted.Many private hospitals in Calcutta, which are not designated for Covid-19 patients but have isolation units where such patients are being treated, said they had exceeded their capacity. One private hospital said it had 10 coronavirus positive patients in its 12-bed isolation unit. “We had to create an additional unit for nearly 15 more who are high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients and awaiting results of swab tests,” said an official of the hospital.",2020-04-21 20:50:00
372,TT Bureau,Coronavirus outbreak: 2000 NIV kits for Calcutta hospitals after ‘fault cry’ - Telegraph India,"The Centre-run National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) on Tuesday sent 2,000 kits assembled at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, each to SSKM Hospital and the School of Tropical Medicine.The move follows the health department's allegation that results were getting delayed because of faulty NICED kits.The swab test kits sent on Tuesday are the ones assembled at NIV and there have been no complaints regarding them, a NICED official said. The North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, too, will get 2,000 kits, the official said.“We said three days ago that NIV kits had no problem. But the ones from NICED gave inconclusive results. NICED, too, has admitted to problems with the new batch of kits,” chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Tuesday. “We hope the Union government will give us kits without any problem.”Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamul youth wing chief and Diamond Harbour MP, on Tuesday linked the matter of faulty kits and the arrival of central teams in Calcutta in a tweet. “You cripple GoWB with faulty kits from ICMR & then send IMCTs to monitor GoWB's performance while keeping the State Govt in dark. In the name of combating the COVID-19 crisis, you're playing with the lives of Bengalis while your leaders use skewed testing nos for fake propaganda,” he said in the tweet.The state health department had alleged through a series of tweets on Sunday that “testing kits supplied by ICMR-NICED about two weeks ago” started “to throw up a large number of inconclusive’ results, necessitating a repeat/‘confirmatory’ test run, thereby causing a delay in the generation of the final test report”.The allegations were about swab test kits and not rapid antibody-based blood tests.The department had said in the tweets that “there was no problem earlier when the testing kits were being received directly from the National Institute of Virology, Pune”. Problems arose in the recently supplied kits “to government labs in West Bengal” that “have been routed through ICMR-NICED, Kolkata”.Shanta Dutta, the director of NICED, said on Tuesday: “This is not a time for blame game. Our director-general (of the Indian Council of Medical Research) asked us to give kits assembled at NIV Pune to state government labs. We have sent 2,000 kits each to SSKM and STM. We will send 2,000 kits to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. ICMR will send us 10,000 more such kits and we will distribute them to state laboratories again.”Three types of swab test kits had been supplied to state laboratories by NICED, of which the third lot manufactured in China had complaints, the health department had alleged.The kits may have lost their activity because of problems in storage temperature, an ICMR official said. It could have happened at the testing laboratories or during transport. “The RT-PCR kits used for swab tests need to be kept below 20 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is higher, then the test results are not proper,” the official said.",2020-04-21 20:51:00
373,Sanjay Mandal,Doctors seek more testing centres in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Eight doctors’ organisations, including the Indian Medical Association (IMA), on Tuesday requested chief minister Mamata Banerjee to create more testing and sample collection centres for Covid-19 and proper audit “at every level” to avoid “maldistribution and misuse” of personal protective equipment.The doctors met for two days in the city and drew up a list of demands that would be sent to the chief minister. The letter to the chief minister also includes “real- time transparent data” on the Covid-19 situation in Bengal.“With the permission of the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), more and more corona testing centres should be set up in keeping with ICMR guidelines. The local administration should also be empowered to order testing according to ICMR guidelines,” the letter said. “There should be sample collection centres at least at every sub-division. Copy of the reports should also reach the treating physicians as well at the same time.”Santanu Sen, the state secretary and immediate past national president of IMA, said sample collection centres at sub divisional levels would help people living in the remote areas. “Then people living in Jalpaiguri don't have to travel to Siliguri to get tests done,” said Sen. “The Centre should give permission to set up test laboratories in every district of Bengal,” said Sen, a Trinamul Rajya Sabha MP.The doctors’ organisations that attended the meeting include West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, Association of Health Service Doctors, Service Doctors’ Forum, Medical Service Centre and Doctors for Patient.This was the first time since the outbreak of the disease that the city’s doctors’ organisations held a meeting and prepare a charter of demands.A representative of one of the organisations said there were some problems in the Covid-19 management that they have identified and were discussed.One of the main demands was adequate safety measures for all frontline healthcare workers.“If they get affected then not only they will become bigger sources of epidemic, many fields in the healthcare sector might collapse in the near future,” the letter stated. The doctors also demanded a proper audit of the distribution of personal protective equipment for   healthcare personnel  “at every level” treating coronavirus patients and those with symptoms.“We are observing in many hospitals those who are not treating Covid-19 patients or those with symptoms, are wearing PPEs. This will create shortage of such equipment and affect healthcare services,” said a doctor who attended the meeting.",2020-04-21 20:52:00
374,Debraj Mitra,Fresh rain forecast for Calcutta after day of thunder - Telegraph India,"Streaks of lightning coursed through a dark early morning sky, accompanied by deafening drum rolls of thunder, on Monday.The lightning was part of a squall, the second to have swept the city after the one on Monday night. Gusts of winds and light rain came before and after the series of lightnings, respectively. The Met office in Alipore recorded a maximum wind speed of 56kmph around 5.25am.Rain and winds are likely to continue over the next couple of days. “The system will remain active till Thursday night,” said a Met official. The Celsius is likely to drop a few notches.The maximum and minimum temperatures on Monday were 34.5 degrees and 27.2 degrees. On Tuesday, they were 26.6 degrees and 20.5 degrees.“The curtains were drawn and the lights turned off. But the lightning was so powerful that it lit up the whole room,” said Amulya Bagchi, who lives near Gariahat. He had got up around 5am on Tuesday.A cyclonic circulation over large parts of central and eastern India — from Madhya Pradesh to eastern Assam — brought about the change in the weather, the Met office has said.“Jharkhand and Gangetic Bengal are also under its influence,” said G.K. Das, director, India Meteorological Department, Calcutta.A high-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal is playing second fiddle to the circulation, boosting the flow of moisture into land.Before Monday, another squall had hit the city on Saturday. It had generated wind speeds of around 30-35kmph.A trough of low pressure, which led to winds and rain on Saturday, had intensified into a cyclonic circulation. On Monday, the thunderclouds kept moving eastwards towards Bengal and reached Calcutta in the evening.The sky had been cloudy all day on Monday. But few people had expected the powerful lightnings at such regular intervals after 9pm. A squall, generating wind speeds of over 40kmph, swept the city before a brief but sharp spell of rain.",2020-04-21 20:54:00
375,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus outbreak: Another five test positive at calcutta medical college, count up to 15 - Telegraph India","Interns at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital have blamed alleged mismanagement and lack of adequate precautionary measures for the spread of the novel coronavirus among doctors and nurses of the hospital.Health department sources said about 15 doctors and nurses of the central Calcutta hospital tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, over the past week, five of them on Tuesday.Of those who tested positive on Tuesday, four were nurses and one was an intern. Among the other positive cases, eight are doctors and two nurses.An intern told Metro on Tuesday that there was a severe shortage of N-95 masks for healthcare personnel at the hospital, as a result of which they were being exposed to infection.“Personal protective equipment (PPE), too, are in short supply. So many of us are testing positive because of mismanagement by the authorities, as a result of which we are being forced to work without the mandatory protective gear,” the intern said.According to another, the authorities have not issued any guideline on how to screen a patient arriving at the emergency ward after the fever clinic at the hospital closes for the day at 2pm.The interns, who earned their MBBS degrees only a few months back, rued they had been left to fend for themselves.“By way of screening, we are asking fever patients turning up in the emergency ward a set of questions prepared on the basis of guidelines posted on the website of the Union health ministry,” said one of the interns.Another said the fever clinic should ideally be running around the clock. “Doctors and others in the fever clinic are better protected against the virus. Round-the-clock functioning of the clinic will minimise the exposure of those of us who lack protective gear to suspected Covid cases,” he said.Another intern recounted what happened when a patient in the gynaecological ward of the hospital tested positive earlier this month.“The authorities sent a few doctors to quarantine and asked them to stay at the hostel, where three or four interns stay in one room. Even if they managed to maintain a distance between each other, they had no option but to use the same bathroom,” the intern said.A senior health department official admitted lapses in quarantining contacts of positive patients.“But the problem has been fixed. From Tuesday, each quarantined healthcare worker will have a room to himself or herself,” the official said.“Contact-tracing of all who tested positive is being done and the contacts are being treated according to the protocol. One hundred contacts at the medical college have been tested and the results are all negative.”Nirmal Maji, the president of the Calcutta unit of the Indian Medical Association and a minister in the Bengal government, said all steps were being taken to ensure safety of doctors, nurses, paramedical staff and other healthcare professionals.The interns have also issued a statement saying the authorities had initially ignored their plea to be quarantined after they came in contact with a woman in the gynaecology department who had tested positive for Covid-19.“The authorities said the healthcare providers were exposed for such a brief period that they did not need to be isolated. After repeated protests, the authorities agreed to quarantine them but asked as many as four of them to share a room,” said an intern.The interns held meetings with the college authorities on Tuesday. A team of officials from the health department, too, met the doctors.It was decided at one of the meeting that the interns would be split into groups and each would work for a week by rotation.",2020-04-21 20:54:00
376,Monalisa Chaudhuri, WhatsApp saviour in lockdown lane in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Residents of some of the areas that have been sealed by police as a precaution against transmission of Covid-19 have teamed up with local police stations and formed WhatsApp groups to ensure the supply of essentials is not disrupted.Several neighbourhoods across Calcutta are following a similar model to remain connected over WhatsApp. Around 120 families in Mudiali, whose movement is restricted by police barricades, depend on a WhatsApp group named “Essential Services” to arrange for their daily needs.Four police officers of the local Tollygunge police station, including the officer in charge and the additional officer in charge, are members of the group. The cops have the last word when it comes to allowing any doctor inside the neighbourhood or reacting to any emergency that would need a guardrail to be removed.“We have become a close-knit family now. I never thought we will get vegetables and fruits so easily even after being completely locked down. Whenever we need something, we just put it on the WhatsApp group,” said 66-year-old homemaker Santisri Roy, who lives in a three-storey building in Mudiali. The stretch under total lockdown - between Lake Avenue and SR Das Road - is a mix of standalone buildings and multi-storeyed apartment blocks comprising around 120 families.The area, where a resident has tested positive for Covid-19, has been barricaded by the police with guardrails to ensure no one steps in or out without any genuine reason.The police said the residents had been categorically told that they should only step out to buy essentials such as groceries or vegetables or if there is an emergency.“For buying essentials, they are allowed only till the barricade, where vendors from the Lake market are turning up every day for 10 to 15 minutes so residents can buy their stuff,” said an officer of Tollygunge police station. For medical emergencies, residents are either depending on WhatsApp video conferencing with doctors or on the discretion of the local police to allow a doctor to enter the neighbourhood.“The other day, we had a medical emergency with a 15-year-old boy in our neighbourhood. We managed to connect with a doctor through video call. He prescribed some medicines, which we bought with the help of the police. The boy is fine now,” said Manoj Shaw, a resident of Mudiali and also the secretary of a local club. The neighbourhood has a doctor and an electrician, who are part of the WhatsApp group. The “survival strategy” in Bhowanipore’s Puddapukur is slightly different with some residents volunteering to help others by taking care of their daily needs and seeking local police’s assistance when needed.Sharmila Roy, 49, is one of the 15-odd residents who have come forward with a helping hand to support the daily needs of the people in the area.“Since I have a scooter, I can move around and collect essentials. We are getting a lot of support from Bhowanipore police station,” Roy said.Neighbourhoods from Kesd[topur to Salt Lake, in the northern and north-eastern parts of Calcutta, are banking on WhatsApp groups for uninterrupted supply of essentials.Arkaprava Bhar, a resident of Prafulla Kanan in Kestopur, said Narayantala Lane, near their neighbourhood, had been sealed by the police. A local club has formed a WhatsApp group where residents can post their requirements.Partho Chakraborty, a member of the EE Block Residents’ Association in Salt Lake, said they had formed a team of volunteers whose numbers have been given to elderly residents of the block. “We are mostly receiving requests for medicines. We are noting down every request and trying to deliver the medicines within a few hours,” said Chakraborty. An official of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said the civic body had asked residents’ associations and clubs to prepare a list of senior citizens who stay alone and persons with disabilities as well as those with financial difficulties. “In case an area is sealed, we will follow the lists to deliver essentials and medicines,” said the official.Additional reporting by Snehal Sengupta",2020-04-22 20:26:00
377,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Online lessons on but not sure if pupils are learning: Teachers - Telegraph India,"Teachers are worried whether online classes are serving a purpose or only keeping children occupied for a portion of what would have been a school day had it not been for the lockdown,Several schools are mulling ways to make up for the loss of working days on reopening, be it extended hours, truncated holidays or remedial classes.Holding the students’ attention during a virtual  class is tough and many teachers, taking online classes for the first time, are not sure about the pace at which the classes should proceed, some parents said. “My daughter found an online class uninteresting because the teacher was simply reading from the text, assuming the student did not have the book,” said a mother. Several teachers are unsure if the students are actually learning. “When a teacher addresses a class, she can gauge who is with her and following the lesson. In an online class, chapters are being completed but we are not sure how much learning is happening,” said Sharmila Bose, the principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School. Educational consultants, who guide students applying to foreign universities, said there is a difference in the format of an online class and a physical one and it is not necessarily a teacher addressing a class on the screen. “Usually, there is a pre- recorded class that students attend. They are given reading material that they have to read before or after the class or both. There is a discussion platform where students can post questions and the teacher generates a discussion,” said educational consultant Nirmal Agarwal.In online classes being conducted by schoolteachers, questions are usually reserved for the end of the class and in many cases do not get answered even if a child has a doubt. In fact, to cut off unnecessary noise, students are asked to keep their microphones on mute. “The online classes have been successful in keeping the children occupied but whether the students are following the classes is debatable. There is no way to assess that till school resumes,” Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay Schools, said.With most students yet to get textbooks for the new class, most of the teaching is worksheet-based.For example, in a maths class in school, a teacher goes through a sum four or five times over.  But this is  not possible online because time is a constraint. “It’s usually a 40-minute class and about 10 minutes is spent in all the students logging in and another 10 minutes in the teacher introducing the lesson. We could do two sums only,” a Class XI student said. She compared the school maths class with the SAT (a standardised test that students in Classes XI and XII take to apply to universities in the US) class, where 12 students did 20 sums in two hours. “We were sent PDF files of the sums and we solved them online, after which the teacher solved the sums and explained to us,” she said. Teachers are aware of the limitations of online classes but are trying to cope. “In a classroom, there is a discussion and exchange of ideas but that is not always possible in an online class,” said Amita Prasad, the director of Indus Valley World School.Schools like Apeejay are particularly worried about average or below average students and plan to take remedial classes for them.“We will have to keep some classes for a recap when schools reopen,” said Aruna Gomes, the principal of Loreto House. St James' School is thinking of extending the working day by half an hour and also working on Saturdays.  “These are extraordinary situations and parents will expect teachers to respond accordingly,” said Terence Ireland, principal of St James’.",2020-04-22 20:26:00
379,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus lockdown: To London, on an improbable flight   - Telegraph India","A 93-year-old woman, originally from Calcutta, was on board a British Airways flight to London that took off last Sunday, the first flight by the airline from the city in 11 years.Maya Ray Chaudhuri, a British national and resident of Chiswick in west London, used to fly regularly on the British Airways direct flight between Calcutta and London till the airline withdrew from Bengal’s skies in March 2009.Ray Chaudhuri, a frequent visitor to Calcutta, was stuck this time because of the lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus.“I never thought that I would again be able to take a direct flight from Calcutta to London. I was overwhelmed by emotion when I was boarding the flight on Sunday,” Ray Chaudhuri, who travelled alone from Calcutta, told Metro over the phone from her London home.Several countries have evacuated their citizens from India after they got stuck because of the lockdown.The British Airways flight that took off from Calcutta last Sunday carried 160 British nationals, including three infants, back to the UK. This was part of a 12-flight operation undertaken by the British high commission in India.The Boeing 777-200 aircraft had made a technical stop in Delhi before flying to London.“The lady was in tears when she was boarding the flight,” said an official at the Calcutta airport who was overseeing the boarding of passengers.Ray Chaudhuri had first left for England in the 1960s with husband Shankar Ray Chaudhuri, who is no more.“Since then I come to Calcutta every year. Most of the time we would take the British Airways non-stop flight. The familiarity was comforting,” said Ray Chaudhuri.British Airways had touched down in the city for the first time in the late 1920s and withdrew and re-introduced flights several times before finally severing its ties with Calcutta in 2009.“The direct flight gave us a nearer-home feeling. You would board the plane at Heathrow and get down in Calcutta,” said Ray Chaudhuri's daughter Urmila Banerjee, a Londoner. “During the days of direct flight, my mother would travel alone.”But now she has to accompany the elderly lady because they travel by Emirates airline with a stopover in Dubai.This time Ray Chaudhuri had arrived in Calcutta in December with her daughter and was to return to London on April 9. Urmila left after a couple of weeks.“The April 9 flight was cancelled and I was in touch with the British deputy high commission in Calcutta to find out whether any special flight would be arranged. Finally, Nick Low, the deputy high commissioner, helped me and I received information about the (Sunday’s) flight,” said Urmila.",2020-04-22 20:27:00
380,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Quarantine units in Kolkata shut down - Telegraph India,"Some of the quarantine centres set up in Calcutta last week to cope with an expected surge in the number of contacts of Covid-19 patients have been shut fearing protests from people who may not want such a facility in their areas.As a result, Calcuttans who need to be quarantined may be sent to a centre in Barasat.Sources in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said the quarantine centre in New Town’s NBCC Square was full. The government had started using hotels in Calcutta and suburbs as quarantine centres but their occupancy or capacity is not clear.The quarantine centres in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation's area were shut down after orders from the state health department, an official in the civic body said.Metro tried to get in touch with senior Bengal health department officials on shutting down quarantine centres in Calcutta but they were unavailable for comment.The officials did not respond to questions sent by WhatsApp on whether there were plans to set up more quarantine facilities close to Calcutta.With over 120 Covid-19 cases from Calcutta, it is expected that the contact tracing of positive patients would throw up a large number of people who need to be quarantined. Tracing contacts and isolating them are the most important measures to be taken to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, public health professionals said.The centres in the Calcutta municipal area were set up because the authorities felt that more and more people would test positive for Covid-19 following the CMC’s door-to-door surveillance to identify silent carriers of the virus.The challenge was far more in slums where multiple people stay together in a small room and keeping them quarantined at home is next to impossiblePublic health professionals said there was no logic behind not allowing a quarantine centre in the city. The shift of such centres from the city would only lend credence to the wrong notion that Covid-19 patients or their contacts should be allowed to stay in a neighbourhood.The mistaken belief is responsible for the attacks on healthcare workers involved in treatment of Covid-19 patients in various parts of the country.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has stressed time and again that people with Covid-19 or their families should not be ostracised.“The only thing the government has to ensure is that the quarantined people get no opportunity to be physically close to others who are quarantined and caregivers, and under no circumstances should they step out of the centre,” said Subhash Salunke, a senior advisor at the Public Health Foundation of India and an advisor to the Maharashtra government on combating Covid-19.Sources in the CMC said the health department was trying to set up a few more quarantine facilities in New Town.",2020-04-22 20:27:00
381,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: JU steps in after pain at home and PG - Telegraph India,"The plight of a Jadavpur University postgraduate student has brought to light two dark sides of the lockdown: violence at home and the reluctance of some Calcuttans to put paying guests up in the season of the virus.Jadavpur University has now allowed the student to stay at its guesthouse.The student, a resident of Garia, has complained that she was being physically abused by her father and brother who has a developmental disorder and has shown signs of extreme impatience during this period of prolonged confinement at home.In a complaint to the West Bengal Commission for Women’s Rights, the student has said that after an argument with her brother on April 15, he tried to push her.The student, in her email dated April 15, appealed for a “safe residence”.  A team from Narendrapur police station went to the woman’s house early on April 16 after being alerted by the chairperson of the women’s commission, Leena Gangopadhyay.The women’s commission offered the student accommodation at its home in Baruipur, but she declined citing the distance from the university.She stayed with a friend near the Ruby rotary before moving into a paying-guest accommodation on Garfa Main Road but the landlady was wary of letting an outsider stay in the house amid the coronavirus pandemic.JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das told Metro that he had personally spoken to the lady, requesting her not to throw out the student. “I tried telling her it would not be proper of her to throw the young woman out,” he said.The woman then moved into the university guesthouse on Tuesday.Psychologist Ishita Sanyal, who runs an NGO engaged in mental health rehabilitation, said domestic violence has been on the rise worldwide during the lockdown. “People with mental illness or intellectual disability are unable to express their difficulty or concern,” Sanyal said. “The pent-up anxiety gets manifested through aggression.”Sanyal said her organisation, Turning Point, had received several calls from parents of children with disorder, expressing their concern about unusual behavioural patterns among their kids amid the lockdown.Psychotherapist Farishta Dastur Mukherji said the alleged behaviour of the landlady demonstrates how fear overtakes one’s self in a pandemic. “Anxiety is a normal reaction for any human being. But often anxiety overtakes a person’s existence, particularly at a time of the pandemic.”",2020-04-22 20:27:00
383,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Never before seen faces in food queue in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The owner of a small eatery in a Metiabruz bylane feeds the day’s excess food to poor and homeless people in the neighbourhood. The 58-year-old was seen standing in a queue for free ration last week, much to the surprise of the volunteers of the NGO that had organised the camp. “Kismat ka khel hai (It’s a twist of fate),” the man said when a volunteer asked why was he standing in queue for ration. The shop has been shut for over a fortnight and he did not have money to sustain his big family beyond a month, the man explained.Similar faces have been spotted in queues for free food across the city. These are people who would take pride in buying their ration with their own hard-earned money. Most of them had never survived on free food before the lockdown.One of them is a man in his forties who lives near Palm Avenue and earns around Rs 8,000 per months as a contractual peon in a  school in south Calcutta and a few thousand more from a job with a cable operator, collecting monthly payments from subscribers.“The part-time income is extremely important for me. But that has stopped now. The residents are not letting outsiders into their homes,” said the man who lives with his aged parents, wife and an eight-year-old son.He has collected free ration on two occasions during the lockdown, the first time he went to the donor’s house at night. “I got the token but was too embarrassed to stand in a queue for free food. I went to his office in the dark and collected the ration,” the man told Metro.The daily wage earners — rickshaw-pullers, ragpickers, masons and their likes — are worse hit than drivers, domestic help and others in the informal sector, many of whom are still getting their salaries even if they don’t step out for work.Grocery shops are operational in markets across the city. There is no acute shortage of essentials such as cereals, pulses, oil and potatoes.But many are accepting free ration now because they want to keep the little cash they have for an uncertain future.The wife of an app-cab driver stood in a queue at a gurdwara last week to collect free ration. The man used to drive a taxi for decades before he bought his own car.“I have two children. I have not driven my cab for several days now. I have not earned a rupee. But I am having to pay the monthly instalments for the car loan. I have to store ration. What is the option?” said the man, a Taratala resident.A social worker associated with several NGOs distributing food to the underprivileged said he got a call from a member of the residents’ committee of a housing complex who requested him to arrange food for the guards of the building. The social worker suggested the residents start a community kitchen to help the guards. The caller disconnected the phone.“It is not fair to always depend on NGOs. People who are a little better off can together contribute for the underprivileged in their neighbourhood. That would solve a lot of problems,” the social worker told Metro. “That will also give a sense of security to many people. People at the bottom of the pyramid and ones just above the bottom.” A 25-year-old woman, who works as a domestic help in New Alipore, has been granted indefinite leave by her employers, without affecting her salary. Her husband works in a small factory that makes bags. The factory is shut and the husband is out of work. The woman got a week’s ration free, thanks to her employer who is associated with an NGO.“Standing in the queue was embarrassing. I had my face veiled in a dupatta. But I was there for my family, my son. So, it is okay. If need be, I will stand again,” said the help.",2020-04-22 20:29:00
384,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus lockdown: Parents establish ration mismatch - Telegraph India,"Parents of students of a state-aided school in Salt Lake staged a protest on Wednesday when the school distributed midday meal rations, alleging rice and potato packets weighed less than the stipulated weight.Close to 40 men and women had walked or cycled to Salt Lake Primary School in AC Block (Ward 41) to collect packets of rice and potatoes (3kg of each) allotted to each student.Aparna Halder, 36, a homemaker from Kestopur, said a weighing scale was brought from a nearby market as many parents felt each of the packets weighed less than 3kg.The protesting parents and the school authorities alerted the ward councillor about the suspected irregularity. “Our suspicion was proved right as we weighed multiple packets of rice and potatoes… we started a protest in front of the school's gate,” Halder said.Councillor Anindya Chatterjee reached the school along with a team of civic workers. After speaking to the parents, Chatterjee got another set of scales from the AB-AC market. “I asked the civic workers to measure some packets randomly. Every packet we checked weighed less than 3kg.”An education department official of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation is in charge of disbursing the packets from a central kitchen on the compound of Tank No. 12 near GD market.“They later sent additional packets, which were distributed. We handed out packets meant for the needy to the parents to calm them,” Chatterjee said.Rajesh Chirimar, the mayoral council member in charge of education, said it was difficult to weigh every packet because of staff shortage. “Given the number of students, we have to distribute 78,000 packets of rice and an equal number of potato packets. Even teachers are not trained for this.”The state government has decided to provide students with such packets as midday meals cannot be served during the lockdown. The distribution will continue till April 30. Every student has been given a collection date.",2020-04-22 20:29:00
385,Chandreyee Ghose,Coronavirus lockdown: Food and counselling for stranded truckers - Telegraph India,"A 33-year-old truck driver from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, came to Dankuni with a consignment of salt in early April. On his way back, he started running a fever and had difficulty breathing. But he was scared to go to a doctor. An hour’s telephonic counselling later, he sought medical assistance. His family was also educated about the coronavirus.A helpline aimed at educating truck drivers about Covid-19 has helped nearly 300 truck drivers stuck all over India, many of them stranded on the India-Bangladesh border, because of the lockdown.Operation Karuna, launched by Seva Kendra Calcutta on March 26 as part of its Sambandh project, was initially aimed at giving hygiene lessons to truck drivers. But as the nationwide lockdown  began, the helpline took on a bigger role.“Since 2017, our team of counsellors and field supervisers have been trying to empower truck drivers in various parking areas of Bengal, including Howrah, the Shalimar Works, Dankuni, Hooghly, Petrapole and other areas. We have a database of over 13,500 truck drivers, many of whom have reached out to us in the past,” said Kusum Priti Lakra, a project officer of Seva Kendra. The NGO has also counselled truck drivers on various occasions. “We have been calling up the drivers since the lockdown began, trying to educate them about the coronavirus and urging them to maintain personal hygiene. Some have also called us seeking assistance such as food and accommodation,” said Manisha Paira, a counsellor with the project.Ration was provided to 130 truck drivers stuck at Petrapole after a distress call to the helpline. “A 62-year-old driver called us, saying nine of them were stuck in Petrapole near Bongaon. They had no food because all shops were shut. On March 31, we organised ration for them with the help of our field officers and police and gave each of them 5kg rice, 4kg potatoes and soap,” Lakra said.Follow-ups with the cops, the Border Security Force, parking managers and fleet owners revealed that around 130 truck drivers were stranded in the area. Team Sambandh went on to distribute 5kg rice, 2kg daal, 1litre cooking oil and a hygiene kit to each of them. Provash Paul, the secretary of the Bongaon branch of Intuc, said around 85 drivers are stuck in Bangladesh. “It’s important to assure them. We are arranging ration for those stuck in this side of the border with help from Seva Kendra and the BSF,” he said. Father Franklin Menezes, the director of Seva Kendra Calcutta, said: “We will continue to educate truck drivers even after the lockdown.”",2020-04-22 20:32:00

387,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus lockdown: Food comes  with ‘personal touch’ - Telegraph India,"A couple have been providing artisans in Kumartuli, sex workers and their children from Sonagachhi and daily labourers with food packets to help them live through the lockdown in the absence of livelihood.Jaydeep Mukherjee and his wife Swaguna from Dover Lane have received calls for help from various parts of the city. One of the calls was from an artist in Kumartuli who told them many of the artisans were without work and that they needed food.Another call came from Sankar Sarkar, who is part of an education centre in north Calcutta for children of sex workers and daily labourers and street children.“After hearing about their plight we could not just sit idle… we had to stand by these people of our society,” Jaydeep Mukherjee, the owner of a 20-year-old travel company, Meghdutam Travels, said.The family has so far reached out to 2,000 families in various parts of the city, he said.Each of their food packets contain 3kg rice, 1kg potatoes, 500g daal, a litre of cooking oil, biscuits/cakes, soap and even baby food wherever required.“The Mukherjees immediately responded to our call when we reached out to them and did not discriminate among the children or the families who needed help,” Sarkar, the general secretary of Ananda Mandir, the education centre, said. “In fact they came, stood with us and distributed the packets to the families… they did not just send the food packets through someone… there was a personal touch in their giving.”Many of the artisans in Kumartuli left for their hometowns after the Centre announced a lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. At present there are 250-300 artisans in Kumartuli.“Meghdutam Travels is one of the organisations providing the artisans with food. Many are idol-makers while some are associated with decoration,” Mintu Pal, a member of Kumartuli Mritshilpi, an association of artisans, said.In the absence of employees, the challenge is not only to provide people with food but also to procure and pack them, Mukherjee said. “Our daughters Mahima (an ISC examinee) and Medhani (a Class VII student) and my mother Gita Mukherjee who is fighting ovarian cancer are helping us pack the food packets.”",2020-04-22 20:33:00

They also enquired about the problems, if any, that the health staff are facing,' a senior official said.The second central team in North Bengal, however, is yet to begin its field visits, the official said.The team at North Bengal, led by Vineet Joshi, a senior official of HRD ministry, met health officials, including the Jalpaiguri district's chief medical officer (CMOH), and took stock of the situation.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier slammed the Centre for sending teams to look into West Bengal's preparedness for tackling the COVID-19 outbreak and alleged that faulty testing kits were dispatched to the state.There has been a war of words between the West Bengal and the Union governments over the arrival of two central teams in the state to assess the coronavirus situation.",2020-04-23 10:54:00
389,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus lockdown: Temperature check for Ward 41 shoppers - Telegraph India,"An AD Block resident was surprised when a man covered from head to toe in a protective suit stood in front of her and pointed an infrared thermometer at her head in front of the BD market.Debapriya Roy, 27, said that although she was initially taken aback she saw the man walk up to nearly every person who was trying to enter the market and letting people enter only after taking a reading of their body temperature.A group of five civic workers is moving around BD, AB, AC and AD blocks carrying these thermal thermometers. Every morning, during peak market hours these workers are stationing themselves in front of BD Market and AB-AC Market to take temperature readings of everyone.  The initiative has been taken by councillor Anindya Chatterjee of Ward 41 under whose purview these blocks fall.According to Chatterjee, he bought the thermometers from his councillor’s fund as they are effective to find out whether someone is running a fever.“We are using these to monitor all those who are moving around in these blocks. We are stressing on monitoring the markets that are witnessing the largest congregation of people these days,” said Chatterjee.According to him, each thermometer cost him upwards of Rs 4,000 and said that they were much needed in the fight against Covid-19.“The biggest threat are people who might be affected but are not showing symptoms. By using these, we will at least get an idea if someone is running a fever and send him back home promptly from areas where people are there,” he said.According to him even policemen on patrol and delivery agents of food delivery apps and restaurants are being checked by the civic workers if they come across them.A special workshop was organised to train the civic workers to handle the infrared thermometers and to take the readings.“We have attended a workshop and we know the temperature range as well,” said a civic worker who is operating the thermometer.  A senior health official said that they were mulling to emulate this initiative in other wards of the civic body.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-04-23 12:06:00
390,Brinda Sarkar,"Coronavirus lockdown: Caller hoodwinks 76-year-old, Rs 41,000 siphoned - Telegraph India","Crime may have reduced in the backdrop of the lockdown but cyber criminals are still at large, operating through phones, computers and targeting unsuspecting residents. Their latest victim is 76-year-old Sudhir Chandra Nandy of Sector V, who got robbed of Rs 41,000 from his emergency fund.On April 18, Nandy got a call from a person claiming to be from a bank he has an account in. “The man said I had to get my biometrics registered immediately or else I would lose access to the account,” says Nandy, a retired SAIL officer. The urgency in the midst of a pandemic seemed fishy to Nandy, but the crook kept him engaged in conversation for half an hour.“My wife kept telling me from behind not to share any information  with the caller. I knew this myself, having received such a call once before. Back then, I had managed to shrug the caller off but with advancing age my guard has lowered. He tricked me into sharing my CVV number (the three digits printed behind a debit card) and OTP (one-time-password received by text message to authenticate an online transaction). Within moments, Rs 21,000 got debited from the account, followed by Rs 10,000 twice,” he says.A neighbour drove the beleaguered septuagenarian to the bank but due to the lockdown there was no one of authority there at the time. “They said what’s done is done and asked me to go to the cops,” says Nandy, who went to the cyber crime branch at the Bidhannagar north police station in DF Block. From there he was redirected to the thana of his area, in Sector V.“By then, I was so upset my hands were trembling. I couldn’t even write the complaint letter. My neighbour had to do it for me. The money they took was from our emergency fund. I withdrew money from it a while back when my wife fell ill. As it is, we are facing a lot of difficulties without domestic help during the lockdown and now this,” he reflects.New lures by crooksThe police officer overseeing the case says they got another complaint of a cyber crime during the lockdown. “A resident got a call from someone claiming to be from the mobile wallet company he used. The caller conned him into downloading a fake KYC (know your customer) app through which he siphoned off Rs 7,000,” said the officer, asking people not to fall for get-rich-quick schemes.“The trap Nandy fell for is an age-old one. These days crooks are also offering cash back schemes but one has to realise that there are no free lunches. Don’t get greedy and use your common sense to stay alert.”While the police registered a general diary (GD) for Nandy’s case, the officer concedes that it is extremely time-consuming to catch such criminals. “The modus operandi of such crooks is that upon receiving the stolen money they immediately route it to at least 200 different accounts. Tracing it is possible but very time-consuming,” he says.Nandy is treating this experience as a lesson. “Maybe I won’t get the money back but I want to create an awareness so that no one else falls for such a scam again,” he says. The man said I had to get my biometrics registered immediately or else I would lose access to the account Sudhir Chandra Nandy about the fraudulent caller",2020-04-23 12:06:00

393,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus lockdown: Pay-and-use hotel rooms in demand for quarantine - Telegraph India,"They are used to looking after their guests, rushing to the room to address any requirement. But now these hotels are operating under a regimen that bars them from meeting their guests after they check in, leave alone step into their rooms.With Covid-19 cases on the rise in the city, there has been a spike in the number of people who came in contact with a patient and needing to be quarantined for 14 days. While New Town houses the city’s biggest government-run quarantine centre at NBCC Square in Action Area III, there are several private lodges and hotels that have offered their addresses as pay-and-use quarantine centres for those who do not want to stay in the government’s free accommodations.The state government had approached the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India with the offer. With occupancy nil, it was a way for the hotels to register some business. On March 25, Swasthya Bhavan issued an order with a list of the hotels that offered their facilities.“We have six guests currently quarantining with us. They stay confined in their room for the entire duration of their stay. We are giving them packed meals in disposable containers. Our staff members leave the food on a table outside, which they pick up afterwards. We are also leaving disposal bags for the guests to trash the containers in,” said Bilas Das, general manager of Fern Residency.The meal they are provided is a set menu. “It is impossible to provide the regular menu during lockdown,” says Das.These guests do not check in the way it happens in normal circumstances. “We get a call from the health department, informing us about their arrival. They go to the rooms directly and send their identity proof by WhatsApp or mail,” said Debaditya Ghosh, assistant manager of Fab Hotels, which runs a string of budget hotels across the city.The group’s four facilities — Red Velvet Inn, Eco Stay, Stay Inn and Durbar Guest House in the Eco Park police station area — have a total of about 35 people in quarantine. So high is the demand that all the allotted rooms are now occupied. “Most are from Howrah. About 10 to 14 have checked out. One had come from Karunamoyee, Salt Lake,” Ghosh adds.A lodge on Rajarhat Main Road, which did not wish to be named, has five of its 15 rooms allotted for quarantine currently occupied. “They requested to shift to a paid facility after spending a few days at the government quarantine centre. We check their temperature daily with thermal gun,” says Sourabh Dutta, the facility’s operations manager. “Four have checked out. All of them had travel history to foreign countries,” he adds.The staff at most hotels had initially panicked at the thought of having to serve people serving quarantine. “But once we provided them masks, gloves and personal protective equipment, they felt confident,” Das says.The biggest relief for all the hotels is none of the guests has tested positive so far. “So once the quarantine period is over, they get a release letter from the health department and leave. After that the room is sanitised,”  Ghosh says.Local protestMany private facilities are facing hostility from local residents. Recently people protested when health officials went to inspect a house in New Town’s AI Block. In BE Block, Salt Lake, residents were upset on spotting a guest house in their block on a list of facilities purportedly drawn up by the government doing the rounds on social media. “I have received four or five calls from Salt Lake. I assured them that quarantine centres will not be set up in dense residential areas. That has been the chief minister’s directive,” minister Sujit Bose told The Telegraph Salt Lake.",2020-04-23 12:38:00
394,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus: Block committees pool in to disinfect wards - Telegraph India,"Residents of several blocks in Salt Lake have taken it upon themselves to spray disinfectants in their blocks and not wait for the health workers from Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.The residents’ association of AB Block conducted a sanitisation drive covering all the roads and lanes of the block.Madhurilata Basu, a college teacher who stays in the block, said that the decision to sanitise their block was taken as nearly all the residents were worried about Covid-19 infection. The idea to clean the block and spray disinfectants was posted on a residents’ WhatsApp group.The message received great response and the secretary of the block Gopal Dutta along with others drove to Rajarhat and bought a 20 litre jar of sodium hydrochlorite solution.“We got extremely worried after an AD Block businessman tested positive. While the civic body had sanitised our neighbouring block, no bowsers or health workers had entered ours. So we decided to do so ourselves,” said Dutta.After purchasing the disinfectant, the residents roped in the local ward workers who had a sprayer and used it to spray the disinfectant.According to Dutta, they not only sprayed on the road but also used sprinklers to spray the solution on the facades, doors and windows of houses.Like AB Block, the Salt Lake FE Block Residents’ Association also embarked on a block sanitisation drive.Basab Basak, a member of the block association’s executive committee, said that they too had purchased 25 litres of sodium hyrochlorite and sprayed it to sanitise the roads and buildings of the block on April 6.“Although we had shut our community centre a long time back we sanitised that too,” said Basak.Once the decision was taken, the councillor was informed and the machine and manpower were provided by the corporation, added block president Gautam Roy.Residents of two other blocks said that they were also keen to conduct such drives but did not want make their plan public as they felt that would make the civic workers ignore their block for any such drive in future by the corporation.  Pranay Kumar Ray, the mayoral council member in charge of health, admitted that the focus was on sensitive zones. “Several areas in our corporation, including Teghoria, Mondalpara, Kestopur, Jyangra and parts of Salt Lake, have been categorised as sensitive. We are focussing on neighbourhoods which have recorded novel coronavirus positive patients,” said Ray.The corporation is using two truck-mounted water bowsers equipped with sprinklers to eventually spray disinfectants in all 41 wards. Each ward has been given portable units to spray the disinfectants.Another health official said that with limited infrastructure they were facing an uphill task as several areas have been categorised as Covid-19 sensitive zones.",2020-04-23 12:49:00

About six months ago, he got a job as a caretaker in an under-construction building. Recently he was terminated. He got a job offer in another building but because of the lockdown that also was withdrawn. Having nowhere to go, he stayed put in the building. “We were distributing rations among 30 impoverished families in the area when we came upon Pradyot’s pregnant wife Kabita Sutar Sarkar,” said Paulami Roy, a member of the social welfare organisation Cenergy who stays in CE Block.Paulomi called fellow Cenergy member and neighbour Anindita Roy, who is a nursing instructor. “She pointed out on checking her prescriptions that she was due for delivery that very day. But Bidhannagar Subdivisional Hospital informed Pradyot that it was not in a position to admit her. When they had no money for food, how could he could approach a private nursing home and that too for a C-section, as she had had two miscarriages earlier?” Paulami said.Doctor neighbour Sritama Sanyal came forward with contacts in RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. But there was no transport to take her there. A police officer residing in the block informed New Town police station IC Atanu Ghoshal who in turn contacted assistant commissioner of police, Bidhannagar Commissionerate, Sambiti Chakraborty. “She sent a Sahayak Yan taxi to ferry them free to the hospital where the emergency department was already expecting their arrival. The husband is from Nadia and did not know his way around, so his mother-in-law came from a village near Aquatica,” said Paulami.The effort of half a dozen people bore fruit when at 2am that night a daughter was born to Kabita. “A doctor sent us a picture of mother and daughter,” Paulami smiled.The next night the father was stuck at the hospital amid the rain. Police helped ferry him back to New Town.The residents are now asking around for infant clothes from neighbours. “But our biggest worry is where to put them up as a new born should not stay in unhygienic conditions,” she pointed out.",2020-04-23 12:49:00
397,Our Special Correspondent,Usha Ganguli passes away - Telegraph India,"Theatre director and actor Usha Ganguli died on Thursday. She was 74.Her help found her slumped in a chair at her south Calcutta home around 8am, family sources said. A doctor declared she had died of cardio-respiratory failure.Ganguli is survived by her son Hirakendu. Her husband Kamalendu had died earlier and her younger brother, Rajesh Pandey, succumbed to cancer 11 days ago.Ganguli’s office secretary Anirudh Sarkar missed a call from her at 7.22am on Thursday, as did her son around the same time. “Both of us called her back soon after but did not get a response. Around 8.20am, the domestic help who stayed with her called to say that she was unresponsive.”“She was very depressed since that (Rajesh’s death),” said close friend Sohag Sen.Ganguli was born in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur but grew up in Calcutta. In an interview after getting The Telegraph She Awards in 2018, she had said: “I started teaching at Ballygunge Sikhsha Sadan. There, a lady was looking for someone to do the role of Vasantasena in Mrichchakatikam. I did my first play — Mitti Ki Gari, based on Sudraka’s Mrichchakatikam — after my marriage, in 1970.”Ganguli founded her group Rangakarmee in 1976. It is known for non-conformist productions like Mahabhoj, Rudali, Court Martial and Antaryatra. Initially, she invited stalwarts such as Tripti Mitra and Rudraprasad Sengupta to direct — the Tripti Mitra-directed Gudia Ghar, based on Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, won her a Best Actress award from the Bengal government — but later took up the mantle herself.Theatre person Dolly Basu, who knew her from their dance school days as Usha Pandey and in the mid-90s acted in her play Khoj, picks Court Martial as her favourite Rangakarmee production. “It was very difficult to pull off a play with long dialogues and no scene change. Yet it was so taut!”Ganguli is credited with making Hindi theatre mainstream in Bengal. “There were two-three Hindi theatre groups at that time. I realised that their audience was very limited…. My first aim was to create a new audience for Hindi theatre. Our first play was inside a railway auditorium in Sealdah,” she had said in the 2018 interview.“Ushadi did just a couple of plays in Bengali — Mukti and Manasi. And her Hindi plays often involved dialect, like in Rudali. Yet, she could reach out to a Bengal audience. That is no mean feat,” pointed out Basu. Ganguli was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for direction in 1998.“In recent years, she had set up a studio theatre and invited people to experiment there,” Sohag Sen added.The artiste fraternity reacted with sadness at the news of her demise. “I can’t believe she is no more,” Aparna Sen said. “…I had worked with her in Paar and seen many of her productions in which she was unparalleled. My deepest condolences to the family. RIP,” tweeted Shabana Azmi. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee condoled her death.Her last rites were performed at the Keoratala crematorium.",2020-04-23 22:59:00
398,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Loreto House perks up girls online during coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"Loreto House on Middleton Row will conduct motivational and counselling sessions for students of Classes VI to XII to help them open up to their teachers and share what is troubling them during the lockdown. The sessions will be held from the first week of May and each class will have two sessions a week. The principal, a counsellor and a senior coordinator will conduct the sessions. The teachers will address the students and also show them motivational videos. “The idea is to give our girls a sense of security and support. Since they cannot reach out to us, we thought of reaching out to them. They  might not always be able to open up but it is to reassure them that the lines of communication are open,” said Aruna Gomes, the principal of the school. The students can also send messages to the teachers, sharing their worries. Often during regular school days, students come and share their problems with teachers, not always with their class teacher or subject teacher but maybe a primary school teacher, which is not happening now.“The children are all confined to their homes and not everyone has sprawling homes. They might be feeling stressed and that is what made us think of this,” Gomes said.Psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram said it was a welcome and positive move.“It will help recreate virtual classes and give children an opportunity to re-establish some kind of social contact, which is not possible because of social distancing. Interacting in a group and sharing a light moment can also work as a huge morale-booster,” Ram said.The school has started inter-house activities every Saturday to help children relax and give them something beyond academics.The activities — story-writing, photography, composing a song or making a mask — are being coordinated by the house captains, under the supervision of teachers.“We announce the activities in advance and the house captains share it in their respective WhatsApp groups. There is a huge response and sometimes we have to limit entries,” said Ananya Saraf, the head girl.The events are judged by the teachers or even by guests. “Usually, we have our activities in April, May and June and students wait for these all year. We wanted to keep the house spirit alive even during the lockdown and so included events that could be done online,” Ananya said.",2020-04-23 23:01:00
399,Snehal Sengupta,"Coronavirus outbreak: Salt Lake block shut, volunteers ready - Telegraph India","Salt Lake’s GC block was sealed on Thursday by a joint team of police and the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation after a 42-year-old man was admitted to a private hospital in the township with Covid-19 symptoms, officials said.Police have barricaded the area by guardrails to ensure no one steps in or out without a genuine reason. The stretch under total lockdown comprises mostly residential buildings. Several bank branches, a café, a few grocery stores and sweet shops line the stretch. Most operate from the ground floor of residential houses. The Salt Lake branch of a private bank operates out of the ground floor of the three-storey house where the 42-year-old businessman stays with his family and his uncle’s family.More than 200 families stay in GC block.The sight of cops erecting guardrails prompted a section of residents to head to the nearest grocery store or medicine shop.“I came to know from my neighbour that the block has been sealed. I needed some grocery items so I took my car out and headed to the market,” said Komal Agarwal, a resident of the block.Residents have formed a WhatsApp group called “GC block containment area”, where residents can post their requirements for essentials and will get them delivered at their doorsteps.The group includes the deputy commissioner of police of Salt Lake, Surya Pratap Yadav; the inspector-in-charge of Bidhannagar South police station, Supriya Das; Rajesh Chirimar, a mayoral council member of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation; and another civic official.The civic officials will respond to requests for sanitisation from residents and the police will have the last word when it comes to allowing any doctor to enter the block.The civic body and the police will work in tandem to ensure that the residents get their requirements delivered at the earliest.A group of around 15 volunteers from the block has been formed. Each has a list of senior citizens and those who stay alone. The volunteers will ensure that they have an uninterrupted supply of essentials, including medicines.Ashim Chakraborty, 75, a resident of the block, said they had been advised not to step out and post their requirements on the group.“I had stocked up on my regular medicines and also bought some supplies. However, none of us was prepared for a complete lockdown. Messages asking us not to step out have been posted on the WhatsApp group. I don’t have any immediate requirements and hope we won’t face much trouble during the period the area will remain sealed. We have not been told what to do if a pipe in the house leaks or the power line collapses,” said Chakraborty.The police said the residents had been categorically told that they should only step out to buy essentials such as groceries or vegetables or if there is an emergency. “They must post their requirement of essentials on the WhatsApp group. For any medical emergency, they can call us,” Yadav said.",2020-04-23 23:08:00
400,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus outbreak: Dad in Covid-19 hospital, son explains why phone is needed - Telegraph India","A 22-year-old student whose father is admitted to MR Bangur Hospital said the family’s only channel of communication with him could be cut off with the government’s ban on patients using mobile phones in Covid-19 hospitals.The youth, who is himself quarantined in a city hotel along with his mother and two siblings, said they would enquire about his father’s health and needs and come to know the results of the repeated tests over phone. The family was not informed about any phone number at the hospital where they can call to know about the patient’s condition, he said. The ban on mobile phones in Covid hospitals was not implemented till late on Friday, so patients could communicate with their families like before. But the student, who has learnt about the ban through his phone while in quarantine, is worried about what would happen if suddenly the authorities take it away. He, however, did not say he was unable to contact his father on Friday.The 58-year-old patient had called his family members from his mobile phone to give them the news that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. When he ran out of medicines for diabetes, he called up his elder son to ask them to arrange for the medicines. Covid hospitals in the state are not taking in any other patients and so their pharmacies, too, are not stocking up on non-Covid drugs, a doctor at another Covid hospital in the city said.“My father was admitted to hospital on Thursday. His swab samples were taken on Friday and the report arrived on Saturday. It was my father who first called my elder brother to inform us that he had tested positive,” said the student of English literature. He said there was no call from Swasthya Bhavan, the headquarters of the state health department for almost 24 hours after that. It was around noon on Sunday that the family received a call from the health department, asking them to remain prepared because they would be taken to a quarantine centre. The family was given a choice between a pay-and-use quarantine facility at a hotel in Calcutta and a free stay in a government quarantine centre in Barasat. “We chose the hotel because we felt we needed to be within the city in case any help was needed,” said the youth, who along with his elder brother, younger sister and mother are now staying in two rooms of the hotel in central Calcutta, close to their home. Their test reports are yet to arrive. “The people who took our swab samples at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute’s New Town campus told us the results would arrive in two to three days. But it has been four days and there is no information yet,” the youth said.The student said he couldn’t trust the government’s communication system as when his father had run out of his diabetes medicines, the hospital authorities did not alert the family. “My father called us on Tuesday and said he would need his regular medicines for diabetes. With all four of us quarantined, we had to ask our driver to buy medicines to last two weeks and deliver them at MR Bangur Hospital,” he said. A health department order that reached Covid-19 hospitals on Tuesday had banned the use of mobile phones by patients in such hospitals. The order, according to doctors,  said a mobile phone could transmit the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to others. But doctors have said that chances of such transmission are low if basic hygiene is maintained, they said. A doctor at a Covid-19 hospital in the city said that ideally once a patient is admitted to hospital, all medicines should be made available from the hospital’s pharmacy. But in the current situation that is not always possible as pharamacies of Covid-19 hospitals are not stocking up on medicines for other diseases. “It is a critical issue but has to be handled on a case-to-case basis. I would request all patients to spell out clearly at the time of admission if they are carrying enough medicines for their underlying conditions, if any,” said the doctor. This would help the hospital arrange medicines from the area  if no one from the patient’s family is able to deliver the medicines.The student said the family had not received any information on how to enquire about his father.",2020-04-24 20:56:00
401,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus outbreak: Door-to-door symptom scan in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"A door-to-door survey to identify people with Covid-19 symptoms has been started by the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.The survey is being done by the 1,200-odd health workers who have been deployed to look out for stagnant water as part of the civic body’s dengue prevention drive. The pockets where the survey has started include parts of Salt Lake and Baguiati, Jyangra, Hatiara, Raghunathpur, Narayantala, Teghoria, Dhalipara, Atghara and Kaikhali.Several such pockets have been sealed off after persons with symptoms of coronavirus infection were admitted to various hospitals from there.“The surveillance will take place in phases. We have started the drive in those areas that have the highest number of people suspected to be suffering from Covid-19,” said an official of the civic health department.Pranay Kumar Ray, the mayoral council member in charge of health, said a number of people from Teghoria, Kaikhali and Baguiati had to be admitted to various Covid-19 hospitals after they showed symptoms of the disease.“We hope to complete the door-to-door survey towards the middle of May,” said Ray.Civic officials, however, are worried that the corporation does not have enough workers to complete the survey by the middle of May.“We should make repeated visits within a span of 14 days, which is the maximum incubation period of the coronavirus. Finishing the first round of the survey by mid-May will prove an uphill task,” the official said.Each of the 41 wards of the Bidhannagar civic body has been allotted 10 two-member teams for the survey. Each team carries two sheets to record the response of the citizens. “The teams have also been instructed to check for stagnant freshwater in all the houses they visit,” said Ray.The health workers have been asked to note down details of all residents and ask them if they have any symptoms of Covid-19 — fever, dry cough or shortness of breath.If a team comes across an individual having any symptom, the surveillance in the immediate neighbourhood will be intensified and efforts will be made to track down others suffering from symptoms of the disease.“We have started surveillance at the community level hoping it will help us pin-point potential suspects and get them quarantined as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the disease,” said mayor Krishna Chakraborty.“Several markets have also been shifted and many areas have been sealed. We will take in more people if required for the survey.”A resident of Salt Lake’s BD Block, however, said the health workers were merely asking the names of the people staying in a house before hastily moving away.“They just asked our names and then went away. They did not ask for any other details,” said Rishi Agarwal.  The civic body has also introduced the practice of checking the body temperature of people entering and leaving markets of the township.",2020-04-24 20:56:00
402,TT Bureau,"Coronavirus outbreak: Orders on care refusal, body removal & test result in Kolkata  - Telegraph India","Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Friday the government was “concerned” that various hospitals — private as well as government — were refusing to treat patients or asking them to bring Covid-19 negative certificates to get admitted. Later in the evening, at a meeting at Nabanna with the heads of government medical colleges and the superintendent of MR Bangur Hospital, Sinha said bodies of Covid-19 patients should be “immediately shifted from the wards maintaining all protocols”.Patients admitted to MR Bangur, one of the designated Covid-19 treatment centres in Calcutta, have alleged bodies were not being shifted from wards for hours. A video shot by a patient showing bodies lying on beds in a ward has gone viral. The chief secretary also asked officials to ensure that the results of Covid-19 tests arrive within 12 hours of sample collection. There have been allegations that results are arriving five to six days after the collection of the sample.At the meeting, Sinha also asked the hospital heads to ensure no non-Covid-19 patient is refused treatment at any medical college or hospital.“We have received reports that some medical colleges and hospitals (run by the government) in Calcutta have refused patients. This is unacceptable. We have zero tolerance on this. We have taken necessary measures. We will ensure that this doesn’t happen in the government sector,” Sinha had earlier said at a news conference. He also expressed the concern that some hospitals were asking for Covid-19 negative reports from patients before admitting them.Sinha requested private hospitals and doctors running private chambers to not refuse non-Covid-19 patients. “If private hospitals stop admitting patients, a lot of people will be in trouble. We want to assure the private hospitals that the government is with them and we will extend all kinds of support to them,” he said at Nabanna. Officials of several private hospitals said they never refused any patient suffering from any non-Covid-19 disease but a section of doctors was wary about doing procedures.The CEO of a private hospital said some doctors were afraid of going near a patient who did not have symptoms of Covid-19 because of reports that patients suffering from the disease could be asymptomatic.Sinha said he was in regular touch with the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum. He has asked state health department officials to talk to junior doctors and listen to their grievances and demands.",2020-04-24 20:56:00
403,Kaustav Bakshi  And Amrita Roychowdhury,"Coronavirus outbreak: Caregivers also need empathy, love and leave  - Telegraph India","Weary and exasperated with taking care of an intellectually disabled adult daughter, the protagonist of Aparna Sen’s Paromitar Ek Din (2000), Sanaka, breaks down in an emotional outburst: “For 25 years I have been doing this… as if, I have nothing else in my life… it’s like dying a miserable death every day within these four walls.”What appears extremely significant at the current moment, is the ageing Sanaka’s reference to the confinement “within these four walls” of the house with a periodically violent schizophrenic daughter who needs unwavering attention.The recent incident of a 78-year-old father killing his middle-aged intellectually disabled son during the coronavirus  lockdown shook many; activists, psychologists, social thinkers came together to analyse this incident, underlining the caregiver’s debilitating psychological condition on being stuck with a 45-year-old son, who was similar to Sanaka’s daughter in several ways.This brings us to ponder what caregiving means, and the new challenges of coping caregivers are encountering, when they are literally “locked down” with their intellectually or physically disabled wards, ageing, ailing and terminally ill parents, spouses, and other relatives, and with dependents who may or may not be blood relations.One often forgets the caregiver is also in need of empathy, love and is rightfully entitled to leave, like any other worker. The emotional labour involved in caregiving is immense but often goes unnoticed and certainly unpaid, particularly if the caregiver is a family member, for they are bound by duty. Fearing social censure, they cannot even protest, no matter how fatigued they are.Caregiving does not only mean “looking after” the physical needs of someone; it also entails emotional support, sometimes even unconditional love. This in turn generates emotional distress in caregivers, an extreme manifestation of which was perhaps seen in the elderly caregiver strangling his son.In a special issue of Seminars in Oncology Nursing focusing on ‘Oncology Family Caregivers’ (2012), researchers point out that while emotional distress in caregivers is common, the effects of this distress, if unaddressed, often cause “changes in their immune system that can lead to flare-ups in auto-immune diseases, worsened glucose control in the body, and increased vulnerability to cardiovascular diseases”.Medical practitioners and therapists highly recommend taking periodical breaks — in fact, physical distancing — from the monotonous task of caregiving, notwithstanding how emotionally involved the caregiver may be with his/her dependent.During this unprecedented condition of a global lockdown, where several caregivers are confined within the four walls with their dependents all through the day, emotional distress, anxiety, resentment, and suicidal tendencies among caregivers would be invariably on the rise.“Co-morbidities is a word that looms large in the caregiver’s consciousness these days. While neighbours would say that it is so convenient for my parents to have an unmarried daughter to look after them during the lockdown, one has to deal with the emotional impact of the shrinking of personal space, something my job and love for travel allowed me all these years,” said an academic taking care of her ageing parents.While medical help in times of emergency is almost inaccessible at this moment with hospitals and doctors overburdened with Covid-19 patients, other forms of assistance, such as therapy, are also difficult to procure. Those, belonging to the less privileged sections of the society, are rendered even more helpless, having to worry about finances like never before.These additional concerns the lockdown has thrust upon caregivers are adding to their mental stress, which is finding manifestation in emotional outbursts, abuses, and even, murder of the dependent.While caregivers, particularly in this quarantined situation, are often on the verge of a nervous breakdown, those, who are in dire need of care, are also finding it difficult to hold up. For many, particularly for the members of the LGBTQ+ community and persons with disability, their community is their emotional caregiver at times.For LGBTQ+ people, living with parents, who are often hostile to their sexual choices, the lockdown could be devastating; they seek support, care and compassion within the community, which, because of compulsory social distancing is now unavailable to them.A person who works with a Calcutta-based NGO feels miserable in this lockdown situation, when she is stuck in the house with parents who are pestering her to get married to a man.For this person, her caregivers are her friends of the LGBTQ+ community, who have been with her through thick and thin. Talking to them on the phone or video-chatting with them is not helping, for, she is unable to inhabit a free space away from home, away from the constant vigilance of homophobic parents. Her caregiving family is not her biological parents but the community at large.An academic and elocutionist, who is visually impaired and also suffers from a certain level of hearing impairment, has been deeply inconvenienced on being cut off from his community of disabled friends, because of the stay-at-home mandate.For him, talking to friends on the phone is not feasible, because of his hearing impairment; more importantly, as a person with deafness and blindness he is heavily dependent “on the experience of touch and tactile exploration”, which is not possible when the transmission of the novel coronavirus is happening mostly through touch. For him, his mother is his caregiver at home. But he draws his emotional sustenance mostly through community socialising.Caregivers and care-seekers are both in distress during this pandemic. However, sometimes these little heart-warming stories pop up: Pawan Dhall of Varta Trust, which works for LGBTQ+ rights, is the sole caregiver of his aged mother who is suffering from glaucoma-induced blindness.Dhall said that despite occasional irritation of being locked up all day with an ailing mother, he is also reconnecting with her, learning to appreciate her expertise at storytelling, which is filling up many empty hours.There is certainly some sunshine amid all the darkness; but it is a matter of concern how empathetically caregivers can sustain themselves in their jobs, or how care-seekers can find sustenance, with the economy crashing amid the fear of a deadly virus.Kaustav Bakshi is an assistant professor at the department of English, Jadavpur University, and Amrita Roychowdhury is a social entrepreneur and founder,  Transcendent Knowledge Society",2020-04-24 20:56:00
404,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Implement lockdown strictly says Anuj Sharma - Telegraph India,"Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma has instructed his officers to “strictly” enforce the lockdown, forced by the novel coronavirus, across Calcutta.“The top cop posted a message on an official WhatsApp group of Calcutta police on Thursday evening, telling officers he wants the lockdown to be 'implemented strictly’ and that there are reports of widespread violation across the city,” an officer said.The message was followed by a meeting of senior police officers at Lalbazar, which all divisional deputy commissioners were asked to attend.Insiders said the meeting discussed, among many things, how to enforce the lockdown more strictly across all containment zones in the city that have been reporting fresh Covid-19 cases over the past two weeks.“Several measures are being drawn up. Vehicles on the roads will be checked more intensely to find out whether the passengers had stepped out for valid reasons or not. Social distancing norms, too, will be enforced more vigorously, especially in places of congregation,” said a senior police officer.Senior officers have been instructed to ensure that officers on the roads scan vehicles “more vigorously” and look for valid passes.“We can’t spell out everything. Some of the markets may be relocated,” another officer said.Police commissioner Sharma’s message on the WhatsApp group came hours after chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said Calcutta alone accounted for “not less than 80 per cent” of the 58 new cases reported in the state overnight.A section of senior officers said efforts had been launched to identify new locations where markets could be shifted so that social distancing norms could be implemented.A few markets have already been shifted, including the ones in Bagmari and Narkeldanga.More cops will be deployed in the markets that cannot be relocated — such as the ones in Gariahat, Kasba, Kalikapur, Garfa and Beleghata and Jadu Babur Bazaar in Bhowanipore — for stricter enforcement of the norm.“There is a market on Syed Ahmed Road in the Entally area. We will shift it elsewhere,” said a senior officer. “Similarly, we might try and shift the market in Panditya to another location.”Police officers admitted that markets were drawing huge crowds in the morning and again in the evening, making it difficult for them to implement social distancing norms.",2020-04-24 20:56:00
405,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Howrah big market curbs  - Telegraph India,"Police have closed down all big markets in Howrah’s Malipanchghora, Salkia, Pilkhana and Golabari and set up teams with youths from clubs and puja committees to deliver essential items to residents.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has specifically instructed the district administration to enforce social distancing norms following Howrah’s emergence as a red zone in terms of Covid-19 patients.“If we fail to control the situation, the infection may spread at the community level and it would be a very serious condition,” she had recently said, while referring to the situation in Calcutta and Howrah. “I would request everyone to stay indoors. If needed, the police can deliver food at your houses.”Malipanchghora in Howrah is spread over five wards with an approximate population of around 80,000. Pilkhana has close to 45,000 people, almost the same as   Salkia and Golabari.In Malipanchghora and Pilkhana, cops have shut down Horogunge and Pilkhana markets to prevent gathering of people. “Each area has been divided into paras or lanes and for each para or lane a grocery shop, a vegetable vendor and a fish seller have been identified. Their numbers have been passed on to the team members,” an officer in the Howrah commissionerate said.“Residents place orders on WhatsApp and the team delivers the items. Since there is no overlapping of paras and lanes, shopkeepers and vendors are happy with their fixed customers.”“We have added medicine shops in every group. An elderly resident was unable to get a particular medicine. He posted it on the group and a team member got it from Belur with the help of the police,” Kusum Bhattacharya, a resident of Aurobinda Road in Malipanchghora, said.“We have decided that fish sellers will visit between 7am 9am. Vegetable vendors will turn up twice a day, morning and evening,” Samit Kumar Ghosh, a member of Salkia Barowari Club, said. “Grocery shops take orders in the morning. Items are delivered in the evening by our boys.”The police have found a ready source of information on lockdown violations from the groups. “Wherever there is a violation, someone posts a picture on his/her group, along with the address,” the Howrah commissionerate officer said. “Cops reach the spot in 10 minutes.”",2020-04-24 20:57:00
406,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus outbreak: Personal gear from Xavier’s alumni - Telegraph India,"A Park Street hospital got 300 personal protection equipment sets at St Xavier’s College on Friday.Each single-use kit contained face shield, goggles, mask, gloves, a coverall gown and shoe cover.“We need to stand by doctors and other frontline health service providers, who have been extending yeomen humanitarian service at this trying time. Our small effort will surely give a positive signal to that section of the society, which is trying to socially outcast this noble professionals,” Father Dominic Savio, the principal of the college, said while distributing the kits.Healthcare workers at government and private hospitals, even those who have not been in contact with Covid-19 patients, have been stigmatised in the city and elsewhere in Bengal. Officials of government and private hospital said“These will be of great help, considering the pressure that our doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are under. The stock should last over a week,” Indranil Mukhopadhyay, vice-president of Mission of Mercy Hospital and Research Centre who collected the PPE gear, said.The help was organised by the St Xavier’s College (Calcutta) Alumni Association. “We procured the PPE from an authorised supplier. The gear confirms to the standards of the World Health Organisation and the Indian government,” an organiser said.“Doctors and healthcare workers are our saviours; so, we felt the urgency of empowering them,” Sanjib Koner, honourary secretary of the alumni association, said.",2020-04-24 20:57:00

The school had planned a cultural programme, involving more than 600 students, on April 20 to mark the occasion. With the programme cancelled because of the lockdown, the school decided to contribute Rs 5 lakh to the chief minister’s relief fund to help the state in its fight against the coronavirus outbreak. “This is the least we could do for the welfare of our state,” principal Indrani Mitra said. Rector Sanghamitra Mukherjee said social service has been an integral part of the school’s history. “So when our final celebrations could not take place, we decided to keep the spirit of the school alive through this contribution.”The school received a gift, too — three videos, planned and shot during the lockdown, by members of the alumni association.“Around 50 ex-students were involved in the making of the videos. All the performers shot their bits at home,” said Sharmistha Chakravarty, who played narrator, while her daughter Debayani Das, also an ex-student, performed a dance from the Netherlands.“We wanted to tell the world though we could not get together physically, we were united in spirit,” added Maitrayee Sen, treasurer of the Old Girls’ Association.",2020-04-24 20:58:00

He spoke to me a lot, not only during the time he was at KKR but even after that,” Kuldeep said on the KKR website. “He always kept me motivated. So when you get that kind of confidence from your captain, it becomes a huge plus for any player. It helps you to remain confident, and that translates into good performances.” Talking about Akram, who used to be KKR’s bowling coach and mentor, Kuldeep said the former Pakistan skipper helped him more when it came to the mental aspect of the game. “Wasim Sir didn’t speak much about bowling, but he prepared me a lot in terms of taking on the game mentally.”",2020-04-25 21:59:00
409,Snehal Sengupta,"Coronavirus outbreak: Duttabad, bordering Salt Lake, sealed - Telegraph India","The Duttabad area along EM Bypass, which borders parts of Purbachal Housing Complex in Salt Lake, was sealed on Saturday after a 39-year-old man with Covid-19 symptoms was admitted to hospital.The man lives with at least eight family members. None was taken to a quarantine centre till late on Saturday, an official of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said.Police teams blocked nearly all lanes and bylanes with guardrails or inter-linked bamboo poles to ensure no one steps in or out without a genuine reason.An officer of the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate said they had sealed the area because almost all household help in adjacent areas in Salt Lake stay in Duttabad and many of them were going to work despite the lockdown. The sealed-off zone has tenements standing cheek by jowl. There are more than 10,000 single and two-room dwelling units, where more than 50,000 people live.Duttabad has a number of community toilets and taps where crowds gather. “It is difficult to maintain social distancing norms at these points,” a civic official said. On Saturday afternoon, Metro spotted a large number of men and women sitting or standing close to one another, waiting to fill containers with water from roadside taps. Swapan Mondal, a carpenter, said they had no option but to mill around the tap. “This tap serves at least 100 families. We have no option but to come here and collect water,” he said. Local councillor Nirmal Dutta said he had asked neighbourhood clubs to help distribute food and essential items to the residents of Duttabad. An officer of the commissionerate said they were facing an uphill task trying to prevent people from leaving or entering the pocket. “Most are not listening to our warnings.

410,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: 2 more private hospitals for Covid-19 - Telegraph India,"The state government has turned two private hospitals in Salt Lake and New Town into dedicated Covid-19 treatment centres as the demand is soaring among patients for more comfortable facilities.Health department sources said they were speaking to many other private hospitals in the city, requesting them to earmark large sections of their facilities for treatment of patients diagnosed with coronavirus infection.ILS Hospital in Salt Lake and Ohio Hospital in New Town are the ones that have been requisitioned by the state government for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Officials of ILS Hospitals said they had received the health department's notification and were planning to shift the patients, including neo-natals, to other hospitals.“In view of the emergent situation of the Covid-19 pandemic, 66 private healthcare facilities for management of Covid-19 affected patients have already been notified as Covid designated hospitals. Now, in order to increase the facility, the following hospitals will be notified as Covid designated hospital...,” a health department notice stated, mentioning ILS, Salt Lake, and Ohio Hospital.ILS Hospital has been reserved for the treatment of Covid-19 patients of levels one and two, which means those suffering from severe acute respiratory infection and other symptoms of the disease but are yet to test positive. Ohio Hospital is for patients of levels three and four — those who have tested positive and with mild or severe symptoms. This facility should have ventilators and other life support equipment, officials said. The government-run Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital and MR Bangur Hospital, and an annexe of AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake, a private facility, were earlier designated as Covid-19 treatment centres in the city.“The demand for beds in a private hospital for people with Covid-19 symptoms is rising by the day. Many people don't want to go to government facilities such as MR Bangur Hospital or the Beleghata ID hospital,” an official in the health department said.The state government had a few days ago made a fresh appeal to private hospitals to dedicate more beds and wings to the Covid battle. An official of a private hospital said they had turned down the government’s request to set aside 100 beds for coronavirus patients.A resident of Howrah who is running a temperature and suffering from respiratory distress was trying since Saturday morning to get a bed at a private hospital. All hospitals said their isolation units were full.Finally, late in the evening, he could get himself admitted at a private hospital in south Calcutta.At AMRI Salt Lake, only patients referred by the government can be admitted. But officials of the hospital said they were flooded with requests from people for direct admission every day. The facility has 51 beds, 39 of which are functional. On Saturday, all 39 were full.“We have a shortage of personnel, so 12 beds could not be made functional. Already there is a waiting list of six patients at government-run Covid-19 hospitals who need to be shifted. So, the government today requested us to make the 12 beds functional as soon as possible. We are trying to make them operational by Monday,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI.Metro has reported that patients have complained about poor facilities at MR Bangur Hospital. A youth who was admitted in the hospital had said at least two bodies of Covid-19 patients were not removed for hours from the ward. His mother, who was admitted in another ward, had alleged that an elderly woman had fallen and there was no one from the hospital staff around to help her get up. “The demand for getting admitted to a private facility with clean washrooms and other basic amenities is growing. The facilities are needed all the more because a Covid-19 patient has to stay 14 to 20 days in hospital,” said a health official.Another reason for the soaring demand of private hospitals is shortage of ventilators at state-run facilities, government sources said.In the initial days of the outbreak, the state government had appealed to private hospitals to keep isolation beds ready. Many private hospitals in the city did so but only a few beds were set aside. Many of them are allegedly not admitting Covid-19 patients or those with symptoms.“Our isolation beds are for patients who are testing positive for the coronavirus after getting admitted. They are then shifted to government facilities. We are not admitting patients with fever or other Covid-19 symptoms,” said the CEO of a private hospital.",2020-04-25 22:04:00
411,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus outbreak: Virus awareness on patachitra - Telegraph India,"Like her ancestors, she is used to retelling mythological lores, folk tales and social sagas in live performances. Now Swarna Chitrakar, one of the best-known scroll painters of her generation, is using her art to lend a hand in the fight against Covid-19.The fifth generation patua has composed a song and drawn a pata on coronavirus, focusing on its ferocity and urging people to follow guidelines. A clip of her performance, recorded five days ago by her youngest daughter Nupur, is doing the rounds on Facebook.“When I heard about the virus, I wanted to do something. I don’t have money to donate. So I thought of contributing to the fight by what I can do so that people take the virus seriously,” said the 50-year-old from Naya village in Pingla, West Midnapore. The virus has hit the adjoining East Midnapore district, the borders of which, she says, are sealed now.It took her a day to come up with the song. Then she started painting. The red coronavirus figure — with eyes, nostrils and a thick lip — on the pata looks nothing like the electron microscope images. “It is a product of my imagination,” she said. The song and the scroll painting end with her reposing faith in the Lord who, she says, has given scientists and doctors the intelligence to beat the virus.Before the video was shot, only her neighbours had heard and seen her latest creation. “Because of the lockdown, I could not recharge my phone. A teacher from IIT Kharagpur, who called to check how I was doing, kindly made the online payment so I could get my phone working and upload the video,” she smiled.Though there are about 400 patuas in the area, few can compose original songs, said the artiste, who has earlier done patas on contemporary issues such as AIDS, Nirbhaya gang rape and murder and the 2004 tsunami. “Now that it is on social media, perhaps some of them will pick up my song and draw their own interpretations of it,” said Swarna.While she would be hurt if her imitators do not give her credit (“They often claim my songs as their own”), she would be happy if the government uses the song for an awareness drive.",2020-04-25 22:04:00
412,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Lack of personal space at home affects counselling - Telegraph India,"Psychiatrists and psychologists involved in tele-counselling during the lockdown said the therapy was being compromised because of lack of privacy at their clients’ homes.A person is not always comfortable opening up to the counsellor in the presence of other people. At times the person who is causing mental trauma to the client might be beside him or her during the counselling.Therapists recounted multiple instances of clients reaching out to them through video call during the lockdown but failing to open up or answer queries in the presence of family members.During a session with a psychiatrist, a woman who is harassed by her alcoholic husband failed to answer queries about the abuse because the husband was around. Another psychiatrist said a teenager was on video call but could not speak freely because the parents were around her. “There might be a lack of privacy in some homes and people might not be comfortable sharing their travails in public domain or when they know others are hearing them. Under such circumstances, counselling can get compromised. Not everyone has personal space at home,” said psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram. A psychologist who wished not to be named said that in such situations, they often ask questions that could be answered in “yes” or “no”.“This approach takes more time and is based on some assumptions. Also, during the lockdown, it is difficult to suggest solutions to problems such as domestic violence, because it is not possible now to ask the victim to move out,” the psychologist said. Often, psychiatrists and psychologists draw inferences from postures and gestures of the persons they are talking to and through verbal communication. Video consultation provides limited opportunity for that.“The subtle signs of non-verbal communication are not that clear in a video call. If a person is anxious, he may sweat or be fidgety, which is not always clearly visible in a video call,” said a psychiatrist.Psychiatrist Praveen Kumar said it was advisable to talk to children above eight years of age in private and not in the presence of their parents, because parents often have the wrong impression that everything is alright in school.“In our chamber, we can ask parents to wait outside while we talk to children and let the parents in later. But that may not happen during a video call. Tele-consultation cannot replace clinical examination,” said Kumar. Often those who need help create opportunities by locking themselves up in washrooms or going to the terrace to ensure privacy. Psychiatrist Sarmishtha Chakrabarti has come across situations during the lockdown where teenagers have refused virtual meetings and insisted on face-to face talks. “Teenagers, especially those who are 18 or 19, want to talk alone. Confidentiality and counselling get compromised if that personal space is unavailable. Tele-counselling is not a replacement of face-to-face interaction, but we are trying to reach out and provide mental health support in an emergency situation,” said Chakrabarti.Ram said it was important for those reaching out to them to be mindful of the circumstances and open other lines of communication, such as messages.",2020-04-25 22:04:00
413,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Advisory on reuse of Covid-19 shield - Telegraph India,"The Bengal health department has asked the principals of all medical colleges to ensure reuse of coveralls, gowns, masks, face shields and personal protective equipment by healthcare workers and has drawn up guidelines on how to disinfect the gear.The guidelines say use of N95 masks “may be restricted to fever clinics, suspect and confirmed COVID wards”. Health workers in these places have been advised to wear a surgical mask over the N95 respirator for better protection and to prolong the life of the respirator. “The surgical mask will be discarded after 1 shift (8 hours) of usage and the N95 mask may be reutilised,” the guidelines say.“The protocol for ‘reuse’ has been drawn up after consulting professionals from the field of microbiology, medicine and tropical medicine,” a senior official of the health department said.A section of officials said the decision to reuse the protective gear was taken following an assessment that there was a shortage of these items.“There is obviously a shortage of these items,” said a senior official at Swasthya Bhavan, the state health department headquarters. “The chief minister has said the state has received 2.7 lakh PPEs (personal protective equipment) for doctors and the supply of about 9 lakh PPEs is pending.”The guidelines say N95 masks can be utilised up to five cycles of usage if they are properly disinfected after every use. As for decontamination, the guidelines warn against the use of alcohol and chlorine. The masks will have to be cleaned for reuse only with hydrogen peroxide vapour.Cloth items such as gowns should be washed with soap and warm water or sent to autoclave machines before they are reused. Face shields and goggles should be cleaned in a solution containing 70 per cent alcohol.   “All chief medical officers of health in the districts, too, have been provided with a copy of the guidelines and the detailed reuse protocol so that there is no confusion among healthcare workers in state-run facilities,” the health department official said.  Across medical colleges, doctors have complained of shortage of gloves, masks and PPEs.“Despite repeated appeals, the Centre has sent only 5 per cent of our requirement for protective gear. The Bengal government has been trying hard to arrange the gear,” said Trinamul Rajya Sabha member Santanu Sen, the immediate past president of the Indian Medical Association.",2020-04-25 22:09:00
414,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Floors in two private hospitals shut in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Two private hospitals in the city had to shut down a part of their facilities after a patient admitted in each tested positive for Covid-19, officials said on Saturday.A woman who gave birth to a child last Sunday at the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre on Rawdon Street has tested positive for Covid-19, said an official of the hospital. About 25 doctors and nurses and other employees of the hospital have been quarantined. The hospital has shut down the floor where the woman was admitted. All patients from the floor have been shifted. The operating theatre of the hospital will be shut till Sunday for fumigation. “Two days after the childbirth, the woman had fever on Tuesday. The next day her sample was sent for the Covid-19 test. The report came on Thursday and it was positive,” said an official of the hospital.The newborn’s sample was sent, too. It was negative. The woman has been shifted to a private hospital off EM Bypass.“She was in a cabin, so other patients did not need to be quarantined,” said the official. “Surgeries did take place after the woman gave birth, but the operating theatre is sanitised after every surgery.” At the Institute of Neurosciences in Mullickbazar, a patient tested positive on Friday. The man, who suffers from Parkinson’s disease, was admitted with lower back pain last Wednesday.“We put him in the isolation unit of the intensive therapy unit. Ten patients on the floor where the intensive therapy unit is located has been shifted. The coronavirus patient has been shifted to another private hospital. The ITU is being fumigated,” an official said.",2020-04-25 22:26:00
415,Subhajoy Roy,Coroavirus outbreak in Bengal: Two more quarantine units near Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Two quarantine centres are being set up in New Town and in Howrah’s Baltikuri as the facilities close to Calcutta are filling up fast, sources in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said.An unfinished office building of Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) in New Town and a building under construction of ESI Hospital in Baltikuri, about 12km from Esplanade, will be used to quarantine contacts of Covid-19 patients.The CMC has been asked to make the two facilities ready at the earliest. “The New Town facility will start with 200 beds in four or five days. Another 200 beds can be added. The facility in Baltikuri will take about 10 days to be ready,” said a CMC official.The CFSL building in New Town as well as the ESI Hospital building in Baltikuri lack some basic amenities. “We had to dig the road and lay a water line for about 300 metres so water reaches the CFSL building. There were no sewage and drainage lines, water pumps or internal water lines. All of these have to be built,” said the CMC official. The official said close to 250 positive cases had been reported from Calcutta, 100 of them in last 10 days or so. The jump in the number of positive cases means the number of contacts who need to be quarantined is rising, too. The quarantine centre at New Town’s NBCC Square, where a lot of Calcuttans were sent, is full. A Calcuttan whose father tested positive last week said health department officials had given him and his family the option to choose between a pay-and-use quarantine facility in Calcutta or a free government facility in Barasat. When they asked why they were not being sent to NBCC Square, the officials cited lack of space there. A CMC official said some Calcuttans were given the option of going to a quarantine facility in Hooghly’s Uttarpara. Metro has reported that the CMC had identified several buildings in the Calcutta municipal area which could be used as quarantine centres, following instructions from the state government. Work to furnish these buildings had started when the state government retracted its order. Officials said the government wanted the centres in places that are less crowded. As the CMC has intensified its door-to-door screening in densely populated areas, especially in slums, they want to be ready with more quarantine centres where contacts of more positive cases could be sent. “We have pay-and-use facilities in the city, but not everyone can afford them. Those who cannot will need to be put up in government facilities,” an official said.",2020-04-26 00:17:00
416,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Schools tie up with food delivery app to deliver the books to the students - Telegraph India,"Two schools on the northern fringes of the city, part of the same chain, have started delivering textbooks to homes of students through a food delivery platform.The institutions — St Augustine’s Day School in Barrackpore and Shyamnagar — had started online classes on March 29. The management was flooded with requests from parents who wanted the textbooks to be delivered home because the lockdown had prevented their distribution.The requests prompted the schools to tie up with the food delivery app to deliver the books to the students.Delivery of books started on Friday and will continue for the next 10 days. The students of Classes X and XII had got their books before the lockdown started.Those from Nursery to Class IX and of Class XI will get their books through the delivery platform.“Many parents had already paid for the books. When we had an online meeting with all parents, many asked for the books. Those who want can get the books now and others can take them after the schools reopen,” said Janet Gasper Chowdhury, the president of St Augustine’s Education Society, which runs the two schools. The schools have decided to continue with the online classes through the summer vacation, said Amitava Chowdhury, the society’s chief executive officer and secretary. “The online classes can achieve 70 per cent of what is done in classroom. We have decided to provide this option to parents and till now about 2,900 parents from both schools have responded,” Chowdhury said.The parents opting for the service are being charged for delivery depending on the distance. “I got the books within half an hour of making the request. My son had collected a few books from a senior but getting a new set of books for a new class is exciting,” said Bikash Koley, whose son is in Class VIII.",2020-04-26 00:17:00

Maybe mental health professionals can wake them up to the reality.”Chiranjib Bhattacharjee, the pro vice-chancellor, said they would contact mental health professionals once the lockdown was lifted. “The university has to speak to her before taking any step. She is an adult and her consent is a must before the university takes any step. The authorities must know from her what she wants,” Anuradha Kapoor, director of Swayam, a Calcutta NGO working on violence against women, said.The student had contacted the NGO.In her mail to the West Bengal Commission for Women's Rights on April 15, the final year student had said: 'Some well-wishers have requested the VC of Jadavpur University to grant me shelter. I feel this is the most favourable arrangement as: a) My parents cannot barge into the campus whenever they please to drag me home, b) It is my place of learning, my fellow students and my professors are there, c) It's the best possible ambience for me to carry on to focus on studies better, and d) It will save on commute time to my classes. I would like to shift to my university hostel as soon as possible, if honourable VC sir can kindly arrange'.She had said in the mail that her mother was 'a silent spectator' and at times took part in the abuse as well.Ishita Sanyal, psychologist and founder-director of Turning Point, an NGO engaged in mental health rehabilitation, said matured parental care for children with developmental disorder was crucial during the pandemic.Another university official said the woman's parents should get counselled.Pro-VC Bhattacharya said the university would file a report with Jadavpur police station, detailing how a student had to seek a shelter on the campus because of violence at home. The university will request police to get in touch with Narendrapur police station and seek an explanation from the family on this.The woman's residence is in the Narendrapur police station's area.",2020-04-26 00:17:00
418,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Upscale pockets in Calcutta sealed to stop lockdown violations - Telegraph India,"Police have blocked several pockets in Ballygunge and adjoining areas like Ritchie Road, Deodhar Street, Sayed Amir Ali Avenue and Panditiya Road.The barricades are essentially meant to stop residents from stepping out of their homes. Many have been seen stepping out, at times without any valid reason, police said.“We have been using loudhailers to tell people to remain indoors and to contact us if they needed anything. But many have violated the lockdown rules,” an officer of Ballygunge police station said. “The barriers are more of a mental barricade, asking people to stay indoors.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had visited Ballygunge on Wednesday requesting people to stay indoors and seek police assistance instead of stepping out of homes.Unlike the sealed roads of Tollygunge and Bhowanipore, some space has been left on either end of the barricades in these areas for emergency movement.The barricades are meant to send a message to residents that roads can be totally sealed if they continue to violate the lockdown, an officer said.“We regularly see people who are capable of going for online delivery or buying large quantity of supplies stepping out of their homes every day on the pretext of going to the market. They buy small quantities daily. This had to be stopped.”Officers in the adjoining Gariahat police station had recently spotted an elderly woman, dressed-up, with two bags. She told cops that she was headed to the market.“We persuaded her to return home… we told her that going to market at her age was not a good idea. We shared some of the supplies we had at the police station with her and sent her back home,” an officer of Gariahat police station said. “It was apparent she had no urgency but was bent on stepping out of home, tired of the lockdown.”The Gariahat market, like other markets in the city, remains open daily for a fixed time in the morning.Several residents from the upscale neighbourhoods of Dover Road, Deodhar Street and Ritchie Road depend on online delivery of essential items from retails shops, which have been allowed to function during the lockdown.Madan Kumar Mandal, who runs a medicine shop on Ritchie Road, said most people had been placing orders for home delivery.“I cater to all houses and buildings within a radius of 2km. Most residents used to go for home delivery even under normal circumstances. I deliver medicines round the year but now much more.”An officer of the south east division said the police were ready to help — be it delivery of essential items or a medical emergency. “We just want people to stay at home and give us a call whenever they need anything. That’s it.”",2020-04-26 00:19:00

421,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: North Calcutta Kitchen for footpath toilers - Telegraph India,"A group of students from Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Calcutta, Presidency University and Calcutta University are using their money to feed footpath dwellers of College Street.The students have launched an initiative called “North Calcutta Kitchen” to feed the footpath people, many of whom earn their living as mutiyas (men who ferry goods) in Mechhua Phalpatti and the Sealdah station area. Some also do odd jobs for bookstall owners and publishers.All these day labourers have been jobless since the Centre announced the lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Manmatha Ray, an ISI student, said the kitchen had been set up in a club in Ultadanga and food packets (rice, dal and a mishmash of vegetables) were being sent to College Street in the afternoon.“We are taking care of footpath dwellers in the College Street area through our kitchen just like students of Jadavpur University are doing for the poor in south Calcutta through their community kitchen,” Ray said.The students of ISI, Presidency and Calcutta University are procuring essential items from the districts through their network.Presidency students from Hooghly district have sent rice and potatoes collected from residents of their areas, Sayan Chakrabarty, a postgraduate economics student of the university, said.Students spread across villages in the district have so far procured 1.5 tonnes of rice and potatoes, the student said. “We are getting vegetables from the JU community kitchen… they get their stock from farmers in Bhangar, South 24-Parganas. In return we have been sending the farmers surplus rice and potatoes collected from Hooghly.”Metro had on April 18 reported about the community kitchen run by Jadavpur University students and that they had set up a cooperative with farmers in Bhangar with the help of a Presidency student who lives there to get their unsold vegetables in exchange for rice and pulses.“If they don’t get adequate food their immunity levels will drop… they will die of starvation before any virus can kill them,” Chakrabarty said.In the Ultadanga kitchen, students prepare the lunch by themselves. They have reached out to their alumni for donations to keep the initiative running.Once the food is ready it is packed and the packets sent in a car to the Calcutta University gate. Footpath dwellers queue up to collect the packets from volunteers.The students have engaged some youngsters from among the food recipients to help maintain the queue during distribution. “Azmira, Feeroz and Akash live on the footpath and do odd jobs for a living. We have engaged them to ensure people maintain physical distance while collecting the packets,” Ray said.Poor people living on footpaths in the Shyambazar area and along Vivekananda Road receive food packets as well.",2020-04-26 21:02:00
422,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Overseas freeze on idol orders - Telegraph India,"The coronavirus has struck in the city’s idol-making hub, too, with overseas orders for Durga idols either cancelled or put on hold. The Puja rush would already have begun at Kumartuli in any other year with artisans putting finishing touches to idols before they travel abroad. The idols are usually dispatched by April-May but this time they remain half-done in the studios, artists said. More than 100 idols, many of them made of fibreglass, leave the Kumartuli studios for the UK,  the US, Dubai, Australia and China every year. Several orders were cancelled, after initial bookings in the beginning of the year, even before the artists could start work.“I had received two orders in January,  one for Austria and the other for the UK. The UK order has been cancelled and the one for Austria is on hold as the organisers are still undecided,” said Mintu Pal, an artist in Kumartuli who has been sending idols abroad for close to 10 years. Mintu Pal had started work after receiving a portion of his remuneration in advance. “We don’t know what will happen now. The idols are lying incomplete. Usually, I finish work for the international orders by April and dispatch them because it takes at least three months to reach the destination,” he said.It is only after the overseas idols are finished and sent that the artists concentrate on local orders. Several artists said orders from puja committees in the city, too, have not been confirmed yet.Idol-maker Narayan Chandra Rudra Pal received a few calls in January from puja committees in the US but none of them followed up.“They did not call back and it has to be because of Covid -19. It has affected the business in Kumartuli. By now most of our foreign orders are usually complete or on the verge of completion,” he said. China Pal she had received a request from the US last November for an idol there. “Two women stayed with me for a week for training. They had said they would contact us for the puja in 2020. But nothing materialised,” she said.An order China Pal’s team received from Kochi has also been cancelled. “I had sent them an idol last year. This time, they placed the order in January but a few days into the lockdown they called and said they had decided to get an idol made locally,” China Pal said.An engineer in Calcutta who coordinates with Kumartuli for a puja organised by friends in Trinidad and Tobago said there have been few enquiries this year. “Usually I coordinate for five-six puja committees who want an idol from Calcutta. But this year so far there has been only one, from Port of Spain,” said Partha Pratim Mazumdar. Anindya Pal, a software professional in Calgary, told Metro that the situation was different this year. Kumartuli artisans are not sure about the scale of the pujas in the city this year. Only a few organisers have booked idols so far. “We have received barely 10 to 20 per cent of our usual quota of orders this year,” an artist said.  In the absence of orders, many in Kumartuli are banking on ration from do-gooders for a meal. At least one of them said that he will take orders only on receiving an advance in fear of losses.",2020-04-26 21:02:00
423,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Virus spread worry over late reports - Telegraph India,"Swab test results are taking around four days to arrive, a delay that could throw awry containment plans in the city as contacts of infected persons end up spreading the virus before they are isolated, corporation officials said. A man from central Calcutta, identified as a suspect in the door-to-door surveillance drive carried out by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) this week, was allowed to go home after his swab samples were collected at the New Town campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute. The report is yet to arrive.“The test reports were initially coming within 24 hours, or 36 hours at the most.  I do not know why it is taking four days now,” a corporation official said. Doctors said the man should have been admitted to a hospital and kept there till the test report arrived. Civic doctors have asked the man to be in home quarantine and avoid contact with family members. “He should not have been allowed to go home after the test. What if the report is positive? He would likely have infected many more people by then,” a public health professional said.The delay in  reports would affect the fight against the novel coronavirus, public health professionals said. Even if a person is in hospital during the wait for the test report, his contacts are not isolated till he tests positive. If the report takes long to come, it leads to delay in isolation of contacts and increases chances of the infection spreading,” a doctor said.  Public health professionals across the globe have said identifying and isolating patients and contacts is crucial in the fight against Covid-19. The protocol: test, identify a positive patient, isolate the patient and then isolate contacts to prevent the spread. A senior health official denied any delay in arrival of test reports. But two orders issued by the health department tell a different story. In an order dated April 24, the health department has authorised principals of medical colleges, where Covid-19 tests are being done, to hire data entry operators. The order was issued to “expedite the generation of reports of Covid-19 samples”.Another order issued on April 25 said that “in order to further speed up the testing of swab samples for Covid-19 in the state, it may be necessary to run an extra shift in government laboratories so that testing and reporting can be done within the shortest possible time”. Civic officials suggested equipping more laboratories, especially in and around Calcutta, to conduct the tests so that more people can be tested and reports come in time. Ten laboratories in the city are conducting Covid-19 tests, according to the health department’s bulletin on Sunday. “Calcutta has more cases and the districts most affected — North 24-Parganas, Howrah and East Midnapore — are also close to it. More testing facilities are needed in and around the city,” a doctor said.",2020-04-26 21:02:00
424,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Bus owners in Kolkata seek Nitin Gadkari help - Telegraph India,"Two unions representing close to 49,000 bus owners in Bengal have urged the Union transport minister to consider them as part of micro small and medium enterprises and extend them central help.In a letter to minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday, the unions have urged him to consider the plight of about 49,000 operators of passenger buses and their 250,000 members of staff who have been without any income for more than a month now because of the lockdown.The general secretaries of the Inter and Intra Region Bus Association and the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates have sought a financial package from the minister.The letter comes in the backdrop of Gadkari declaring on April 24 that the government would set up a Rs 1 lakh crore corpus to repay outstanding payments to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The letters by the unions speak about this fund.Several bus owners The Telegraph spoke to said a parked bus meant the owner would have to continue paying EMI for the vehicle, along with a host of other charges, including insurance and road tax, even if his/her income was zero.The blow was “equally severe” for drivers and conductors whose income is dependent on the number of daily trips.“It is not just about hundreds of buses not plying and remaining parked in garages. There are thousands whose livelihood is directly linked to this,” Pallab Majumder, general secretary of the Inter and Intra Region Bus Association, said. “So why wouldn't this sector be considered as part of the micro, small and medium industry?” he asked.“A bus owner will have to cough up anything between Rs 28 and Rs 30,000 every month as EMI even when a bus is kept parked. There are other charges as well,” Tapan Bandopadhayay, general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, said. “If a bus operator takes a loan, he has to pay 15 per cent interest. When someone from the MSME sector seeks a loan he pays 6.5 per cent. Why is this? Are we not a part of even a micro industry?”Across Calcutta, where more than 9,000 private buses ply, several operators said maintenance costs would shoot up if buses continued to remain stationary. “We have been requesting everyone to help us… without some waivers, this industry will simply shut down,” a bus owner in Calcutta said.",2020-04-26 21:04:00

It is a challenge for us. So, it is time to be more careful while handling patients at dedicated Covid hospitals,” a health official said.Bengal has 61 designated hospitals spread across its 23 districts to treat Covid-19 patients.Doctors from Beleghata ID hospital — the chief quarantine centre — and MR Bangur hospital in Tollygunge — the main Covid treatment centre - will conduct the training through video conference.Himadri Ari, the chief medical officer of health in Birbhum, said medical personnel would receive training on treating patients from admission to diagnosis and properly sanitising wards and using personal protective equipment.Abhijit Chowdhury, the convener of the global advisory committee and a member of the expert committee on Covid-19 in Bengal, held a meeting with the district administration, police and health officials at Suri circuit house last week to discuss the training.

426,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: 3 workers in two Kolkata hospitals test positive - Telegraph India,"A private hospital in the city had to shut down its kitchen after a cook tested positive for Covid-19 while another stopped admitting patients because a nurse and a ward boy have been infected.The cook at Belle Vue who tested positive for Covid19 had been on leave for about two weeks, the authorities of the hospital on Loudon Street said.  But the kitchen where he worked was shut down for sanitisation.“Our cook was on leave when he took ill. He visited our flu clinic last Thursday and we arranged for his blood test and a CT scan of thorax before admitting him to the isolation ward. His swab sample was sent for the Covid19 test,” Pradip Tondon, CEO of Belle Vue,  said on Sunday. The test report came at 11am on Friday and showed that the cook was Covid19 positive. He was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, where he is undergoing treatment.Eleven employees of the hospital kitchen who live in the cook’s neighbourhood have been asked to remain in home quarantine for 14 days, Tondon said. Chances of patients admitted to the hospital having been infected are low as the cook had been on leave, the hospital authorities said. The kitchen where the cook worked is attached to the main building of the hospital catering to patients admitted to that wing. The hospital has another kitchen in the annexe building, where it runs an ophthalmology treatment centre. The kitchen in that wing is outsourced to a private agency, said officials. “The kitchen in the main building will remain shut for a few days this week as a precautionary measure. The kitchen in the annexe will serve patients in the main building, too, during this time,” Tondon said.The Marwari Relief Society Hospital on Rabindra Sarani stopped taking in patients on Saturday after a nurse and ward boy tested positive for Covid19, officials said on Sunday.“The reports came on Friday night and both tested positive. We have stopped admission of patients. There are 30odd patients in the hospital now. Some of them have requested discharge,” a hospital official said.The nurse had fever about a week ago and the ward boy had accompanied her in an ambulance to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, the official said. Both are admitted to the government designated hospital at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute unit in New Town.Several doctors attached to the hospital have ben reluctant to report to duty after hearing of the two cases, hospital officials said.

The lack of last-mile connectivity came to the fore from what they said, institute director Anupam Basu said.The institute started seeking feedback after several students complained they were unable to attend online classes, which the institute had started after the announcement of the lockdown.“We are trying to make an assessment based on the information we have received from students over the past fortnight. Approximately 45-50 per cent of the students are unable to attend online classes as they don't have a computer or they are in places that have poor connectivity,”Basu told The Telegraph on Sunday. “A lot of our students come from remote villages in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh… they suffer from this problem of last-mile connectivity.”The NIT is a central institute where half the students are from Bengal and the rest from across the country.An institute official said the survey had been conducted to determine if the ensuing semester exams could be held online. The end-semester exams are held between April and May. “Since half of the students are unable to attend online classes because of this problem of digital divide, it would not be feasible to hold exams online.”Basu said that the institute would hold an online meeting with officials this week to discuss how the exams could be held. “While discussing that, the feedback received from students will be shared.”The institute has been mailing study material and assignments to those who can access computers but are unable to attend online classes because of poor Net connectivity, an official said. “This will help in their preparations. They are free to be in touch with teachers over phone to clear their doubts.”Basu, a professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Kharagpur who is on lien to helm the Durgapur institute, had flagged his concern over last-mile connectivity and the resultant digital divide coming in the way of online classes in an article he had written for Metro on April 10.",2020-04-26 21:17:00

Chutku has no access to online classes like the daughter of her mother’s employer. But she has to write down five pages of a passage that her class teacher WhatsApped her on her private tutor’s phone. And she will be quizzed on the passage.Chutku’s tutor has a smartphone. “Her schoolteacher sends the work that needs to be done to her private tutor who helps Chutku do it,” her mother Mamuni said.Smartphones with Net connectivity is a luxury for urban slum dwellers who have been hit by the lockdown and find it hard to even recharge their prepaid SIMs now.A family of five or six are cooped up in a 10x10ft hovel 24x7. “When the school was running, I did not have to worry about my daughter. But now she is at home. And she does what her teacher tells her to do,” Mamuni said. “I don’t know how she will catch up with all her studies when the school is shut for so many days. I pay for her private tutor and I hope she will help her out.”Most urban poor do whatever it takes to ensure their children get to study. Not just that they also manage coaching outside school. “The lockdown is going to be tough for children. It’s a disruption in their academic routine and many will lag behind once school resumes. It’s only when they cannot follow what is going on in class they lose interest and this leads to dropouts,” A teacher of a coaching centre for underprivileged children in Jadavpur said. “So it’s very important that these children are coached and taught during this period of forced isolation.”The teacher said she was tutoring a student over phone for her board exams due in June. “I am helping her with her English lessons,” the teacher said.Chutku, though, can watch tutorials on TV meant for students of Classes I to VIII. But Paresh Kumar Manna, the former principal of Taki House, a government-sponsored school, said children were no longer serious about studies after learning they would be promoted to the next class this year.“In rural areas most students are first-generation learners. Their parents have discontinued private tuitions on learning they will get automatically promoted,” Manna said. “Students in remote areas will be hit hard by the lockdown… many of the teachers in schools in remote areas don’t know how to teach online or prepare worksheets, which can be sent to students over phone. The pandemic will be over in some months but the loss in terms of education for these children will be huge.”Mamoon Akhtar of Samaritan Help Mission, an NGO in Tikiapara, said it was not possible to teach the children of his school over phone. “Most are children of daily labourers and rickshaw-pullers and they don’t have smartphones. It’s only when schools reopen in June that we will be able to teach them.”Akhtar’s schools Samaritan Mission and Rebecca Belilious English Institution have close to 6,500 children from Tikiapara, Bankra and Pilkhana.Speaking about the tutorials on TV, he said: “What will they study cooped up in impossibly small places… can they really concentrate on studies? They are all psychologically depressed on not being able to go to school. We will have to make up for all the lost time when schools reopen. And we will waive school fees for three months.”",2020-04-26 21:24:00

Food packets are distributed only to those who wear masks and queue up following the protocol. “We have only one condition. We distribute food only to those wearing masks. We don’t make exceptions. And it has worked wonders. Initially we had to turn away many who refused to follow the rule. But now residents make it a point to wear masks at least during the distribution,” said Partha Dey, 52, a tea taster and auctioneer, who lives in the South City residential complex.IT professional Dimple Ahmed, 43, a resident of South City Gardens in Tollygunge, takes a break from work to be part of the distribution. “Everywhere we get asked the same questions. When can we get back to work? Will our employers take us back? ” added Ahmed, who works with an IT solutions company and is a mother of a 12-year-old.Joining the trio is 29-year-old Pratik V. Sanghvi, also a resident of South City complex. “We were all members of the Robin Hood Army that would tie up with restaurants and distribute food to the marginalised people. So, when this lockdown began, we decided to do our bit for society in our individual capacity,” Dey said.The three leave by 10  in the morning, driving two cars in different directions. They collect around 2,000 food packets a day from big and small eateries, including a restaurant on Park Street, that give them a discount. The packets are distributed in areas like Gariahat, Jadavpur, near Ruby Hospital, west canal area, Ultadanga, Tollygunge and Golf Green. “We often go back to the same slums where local volunteers and the cops help us distribute. We also ensure that the local volunteers sanitise their hands before helping us,” added Sanghvi, a wholesale tea seller.The trio have distributed 50,000 packets so far. Another individual distributing food packets every day since lockdown is 30-year-old Zeeshan Majeed of Lower Range.

The number of people arrested for violating the lockdown between 6am and 6pm on Sunday was nine.Howrah was the first district adjoining Calcutta where section 144 of the CrPC had been implemented following reports of multiple Covid-19 patients and lockdown violations.",2020-04-26 21:50:00
436,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Germany to help out Sunderbans families - Telegraph India,"Close to 2,500 families in the Sunderbans, robbed of a day’s full meal, will get food for at least a fortnight.The German consulate in Calcutta will give approximately Rs 28 lakh to Mukti, an NGO in the Sunderbans that has around 15,000 families under its wings.Mukti works in five blocks in the Sunderbans — Patharpratima, Mathurapur I, Mathurapur II, Joynagar II and Kultali.The Telegraph had on April 17 reported how a third of these families were staring at starvation because of the lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus.A survey in these blocks had revealed at least 5,000 families had little or nothing to eat. “The families had received between 2kg and 4kg of rice as free ration. That did not last long because of the several mouths that had to be fed,” Sankar Halder, the founder of Mukti, said on Saturday.“Supporting the most vulnerable with food is the requirement of the hour. We have been providing the needy in Calcutta with food. Our federal foreign office has now sanctioned close to Rs 3 million; so, we will be able to distribute food to thousands of people living in the Sunderbans,” German deputy consul general Jurgen Thomas Schrod said. “We have asked the NGO to start procuring the stuff they need.”He said the formalities had been completed and the money should reach Mukti in a couple of days.“We will provide packs of essential items to close to 2,500 families with the money received from the German consulate,” Halder said.Each pack will have 9kg rice, 7kg potatoes, 3kg dal, a litre of cooking oil, 1kg salt, two soap bars, and four cotton masks, a Mukti volunteer said. For a family of four-five people, the items should last a fortnight, he said.Before the Germans stepped in, a string of Calcutta-based organisations led by Kolkata Gives had donated money that provided around 2,000 families with food.Mukti, founded in 2003, now works with ABOUT 7,000 farmers who sell a part of their produce through the NGO’s online channel.The NGO has a hub in Garia. Every morning, truckloads of organic vegetables arrive there from the Sunderbans. Delivery men on two-wheelers take the vegetables to more than 150 housing complexes in the city.“Before the lockdown, we catered to around 5,000 families. Now, the number has come down to roughly 2,000 families,” a volunteer who oversees the NGO’s delivery channel said.“The home delivery channel, which accounts for around 10 per cent of income for farmers, is the only avenue that is still somewhat operational,” Halder said.He said the German help was “godsend”. The people surveyed by Mukti constitutes a small percentage of the total number of people without food in the Sunderbans, he said.The main source of earning for the farmers is the wholesale market. Sunderbans supplies vegetables to large parts of Calcutta. Traders from Garia, Sonarpur and adjoining areas visit the wholesale markets in the Sunderbans every day. Most of them take suburban trains from Sealdah. Some use private vehicles as well. The stuff bought from the wholesale market is sold at all the big markets in Calcutta.The lockdown has crippled this chain, primarily because of lack of transport options. “The big wholesale market in Raidighi, for example, has been running for just a couple of hours. But only a handful of farmers have been turning up. Buyers from Calcutta are mostly absent because trains have stopped,” Halder said.Earlier this month, the German consulate had tied up with two city-based organisations to provide the hungry with food and frontline health workers with protective gears.",2020-04-26 22:08:00
438,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Lockdown fuels profession switch in Kolkata  - Telegraph India,"A 46-year-old man now wakes up at 3am and goes to Burrabazar’s Mechua fruit market with his brother-in-law to buy fruits. He then readies his makeshift stall by the roadside in Kasba’s Haltu and sells fruits till 2pm.The trader (Metro is withholding his identity) is not a fruit seller. He owns a small jewellery store on Fern Road near Gariahat, which he has been running for over 20 years. With the earnings from the store, he had bought a flat in 2006 and sent his only daughter to a reputable school.The daughter is appearing for the CBSE Class XII exams, which remain incomplete because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus. The man’s earnings first took a major knock after the demonetisation of November 2016. Then came the blow from the GST. Finally, when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, he had no option but to look for an alternative source of earning.“My cash reserve dipped so much that if I did not use the small amount I was left with to start a small trade, I would not have been able to buy the basic food for my family,” he said. “Lockdown is needed but I also need to feed my family. I am exposing myself to the risk of catching the coronavirus by visiting the congested wholesale market daily, but these are desperate times.”His jewellery business, which he used to run out of a 4ftX9ft store, had taken a major hit after the demonetisation and the implementation of the GST regime, he said. “Profit came down by almost half after the two blows,” he said. “Business never looked up again but I was still carrying on, hoping better days would eventually come.”The lockdown hit him the hardest. “I had to chose another way of earning,” he said.The trader had six goldsmiths working for him on a contract basis. Their wages are due, he said, and they often fight with him over the phone for payment. “I have more than Rs 35 lakh due from customers and the market. Most of my customers buy on credit and pay in instalments every month. Because of Poila Baisakh (April 14) and Akshay Tritiya (April 26), I had made a lot of investments, too,” he said. Apart from buying gold, he had also placed orders for calendars and diaries. Unlike big jewellery chains, he does not have the means to carry on despite hefty dues.“All my money is gone into that investment. Problem is there are no buyers and we can’t eat gold,” he said. In desperation, he tried to collect ration from a public distribution system outlet in his area but failed because of documentation problems. He was wondering what to do. “Police would not allow me to open my jewellery shop. So, my plan to use it for selling essential items did not work out,” he said.  A friend, a travel agent in Delhi, had made a video call recently showing him how he was selling vegetables. “I got the idea from him,” he said. Every morning he rides his motorcycle to Mechua to buy fruits and sell them by the roadside. He is making enough to support his family of four. “I feel embarrassed and so do my family members but I keep telling them that this is a temporary phase and I will think of doing something else when things get better,” he said.The trader is thankful to his mask, not just for shielding him from infection but also recognition. “The mask is helping me avoid being suddenly recognised by someone from our locality,” he said.",2020-04-27 21:49:00
439,Kinsuk Basu,"5 coronavirus cases, 30 isolated; test hub seeks hands - Telegraph India","The School of Tropical Medicine (STM) has sought additional staff from the health department after five healthcare providers of the institution tested positive for the coronavirus and as many as 30 employees, including a doctor, had to be quarantined.The central Calcutta institution serves as the Covid-19 testing centre for at least five hospitals in the city and adjoining areas. Besides, all samples collected from Howrah and Hooghly districts are sent to STM for test.Health department officials said the institute could carry out 120 tests daily. Officials said the absence of so many employees had affected two key activities of the institute — running the fever clinic and carrying out coronavirus tests. “The doctors and others who are engaged in diagnosis of the disease at the clinic are working for almost 12 hours every day. So, they cannot help the testing teams,” said an official. “We have sought additional support from the health department in view of the shortage.”Several doctors said fewer staff meant fewer tests and that could delay detection of coronavirus patients. Public health specialists are repeatedly stressing that timely detection of coronavirus carriers are a key to containing the outbreak.Senior officials in the health department said they were making arrangements to send a few laboratory technicians to STM, which was set up in 1914 to conduct research on tropical diseases, by Tuesday.“We have drawn up a list of technicians from various colleges so that tests can be carried out at STM,” said an official of the health department.“A pharmacist and two of his assistants had developed symptoms of Covid-19. They tested positive on Saturday and have been admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital,” said a senior doctor. “The pharmacist had a travel history.”After the pharmacist and his two assistants complained of fever and breathlessness, a team of 30 employees, including a doctor and some nurses, was asked to quarantine themselves at home.“Some of them have tested negative but that doesn’t mean they can resume their duties. Even if all results are negative, we will wait for a final test after 14 days before asking them to turn up for work.”Healthcare workers in various medical colleges and hospitals have been testing positive in significant numbers over the past week or so. Three nurses at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital had tested positive earlier. Three days ago, a doctor attached to the medicine department of the hospital had tested positive. On Sunday, Biplab Kanti Dasgupta, 60, a doctor and an assistant director of health services in the Bengal government, died after contracting Covid-19.“Unless healthcare workers are provided with more personal protection equipment, N95 masks and gloves, more and more of them will test positive for the disease,” said a doctor at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.",2020-04-27 21:50:00
440,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus lockdown: Travel agent whips up meals for delivery - Telegraph India,"Bilolaksha Das, 53, has for many years been running his travel agency, Citi Travels, in Gariahat and a second office on the IIT Kharagpur campus. But the lockdown and uncertain future of the travel and tourism business has made him look for other opportunities. Das, along with his wife, is now cooking lunch and dinner and delivering it to 50-odd homes in and around Gariahat.The 12-odd employees he had hired to run his travel agency, most of whom were based in the Gariahat office, are now working as food delivery boys.Das has been running the travel agency for 26 years. “The business was good at both Calcutta and Kharagpur offices. Many IIT professors are my clients. But I am not sure whether I would be able to run the Kharagpur office,” Das told Metro.“We had faced hiccups during the global economic recession in 2008, too. We recovered from that but business again took a hit after the demonetisation. And with this novel coronavirus, we are in deep trouble,” Das said. A number of airlines owe him about Rs 30 lakh for tickets, which he had bought for his clients, that were left unused following cancellation of flights because of the lockdown.Airlines have told him that it would take them at least six months to repay the dues.“I don’t know how many airlines will survive this crisis. If they collapse, I have to repay clients from my pocket,” he said. Das had also made a number of advanced bookings with hotels and transport agencies on behalf of his clients for the summer vacation. “That has added to the mountain of dues,” he said. Das leaves home on Bondel Road at 7am and heads for the Gariahat market, where he supervises purchase of vegetables, fish, meat and other stuff required for cooking. He and his wife then cook for their food-delivery customers at a property they own in Gariahat.“It’s so different from the cosy life I lived. I used to turn up at the office at 9.30am, speak to clients and sales representatives of airlines and meet friends in the evening,” he recounted. But he feels it necessary to explore other avenues of earning. So, he has turned his attention to the small venture his wife had started — delivering cooked food at homes and offices.“I have a passion for cooking. So, I am enjoying my new job,” he said.Most of his clients in his new venture are elderly people, whose children stay in other cities of India or abroad.“I think this novel coronavirus will change our lives. Food delivery at doorstep can be a big business,” he said.Das is keen to diversify because of the present gloom in the travel industry. “I am not sure when people will start leisure travel again. Not in the near future, I think,” he said.Even corporate travel will take a big blow, he feels.“People are becoming used to online meetings and conferences. This will become the new normal. Many private firms won’t be able to afford air travel by its employees,” he said.Social distancing could also mean a steep hike in air fares, which would prompt many to avoid flights.“After the lockdown is lifted, I plan to run my travel agency on a much smaller scale and look for an alternative,” said Das.",2020-04-27 21:51:00
441,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus pandemic: Teacher couple’s Rs 2-lakh aid in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"An octogenarian couple — retired college teachers — on Monday donated Rs 2 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Arun Bhattacharyya, 84, who used to teach geology at Jadavpur University, and his wife Chitralekha, 81, who used to teach history at Seth Soorajmull Jalan Girls’ College, wrote cheques for Rs 1 lakh each and gave them to Saurav Guha, the Trinamul councillor of Ward 87.“This crisis is unprecedented. The two World Wars did not have such a devastating effect. What we have done is very little but we cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening around us,” Chitralekha, who is writing a book on Calcutta's history, said.She still teaches underprivileged children at a night school in Manoharpukur.The Bhattacharyyas, residents of Tara Road in the Lake Market area, who have been involved in social work for almost two decades now, are the latest among senior citizens to contribute to the relief fund.The couple said they chose to contribute to the chief minister’s fund because they were moved by the way Mamata was “leading the battle against the coronavirus”. “She has been leading from the front like a state’s leader should. I admire that, strictly keeping politics aside,” Chitralekha said.Her husband said the hungry faces during the lockdown reminded him of the Bengal famine in 1943. “People begging for rice starch still haunts me. Our family had given starch to a woman and her little boy. The two had started fighting over the starch. The piping hot liquid fell on the boy and he suffered serious burns. I was a boy then. But I had promised myself that If I had provisions, I would always stand by the downtrodden in my life,” Bhattacharyya said.Their son teaches in Singapore. The couple, like everyone else, have stayed indoors for over a month now. They live with a teenager who lost his father in childhood and has been raised like a son in their house.From teaching at charitable institutions for free to donating essential items to slum residents on the city’s eastern outskirts, the Bhattacharyya couple have always set aside a part of their income for social work.Their driver has been doing their shopping of essential items from Lake Market. “The police have been of great help. We send money and medicines to a senior citizens' home in Behala every month. Cops delivered it this month,” Chitralekha said.On April 12, The Telegraph had reported how Subhash Chandra Banerjee, a retired college teacher in Dum Dum, had called out the cops a day earlier. The policemen, part of a patrol from the Airport police station in the Bidhannagar commissionerate, thought he was hungry but were surprised when he wrote out a cheque for Rs 10,000 in favour of the relief fund to help in the fight against Covid-19.“I always remember people like him. You also keep them in mind. Let such positive things happen for the sake of peace,” Mamata Banerjee had said about Banerjee a few days later.Sisir Roy, 80, a retired engineer from Salt Lake, had handed over a cheque for Rs 10,001 to Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation officials on April 20 to help provide the needy with food during the lockdown.",2020-04-27 21:53:00
443,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Howrah Police help for aged parents after call from US - Telegraph India,"he only son of an ailing octogenarian couple called up the Howrah police commissionerate from California, requesting delivery of essentials to his parents.With Shibpur under complete lockdown, the elderly residents of Ram Mohan Mukherjee Lane had no way to make purchases.Ram Shankar Das, 87, is an Alzheimer’s patient who suffered a heart attack in September last year. His 83-year-old wife, Shanti, had survived a heart attack in October 2010 and was advised bed rest after she fractured her spinal cord in February. A nurse and a cook hired by the couple have not been able to report for work since March 22, forcing Shanti to cook.The couple’s only link to the outside world is a landline — on which they can only receive calls because of a technical fault. Their son Anjan calls up several times a day to find out about their health.Anjan’s childhood friend, Sanjoy Bose, visited the couple occasionally till the police tightened restrictions in the area.“My father stepped out once without a mask to buy groceries and forgot his way home. I keep calling up at different hours all day, trying to understand their needs,” Anjan told Metro from California. “My parents were living in a state worse than a prison. My mother couldn’t take her regular injections. My father couldn’t visit his doctor for cardiac check-up. I could make out from their conversation that supplies were running out.”That is when Anjan decided to reach out to the police for help. “Anjan narrated the plight of his parents and requested help. He gave us his parents’ address and we exchanged numbers. Within a few minutes, he WhatsApped a list of items that had to be delivered,” said Asoke Nath Chattopadhayay, assistant commissioner of police, Howrah.The police have been helping several elderly couples living alone across the city during the lockdown.A police officer from Shibpur traffic guard bought the items that Anjan’s parents needed on Sunday. Sandip Guha, an assistant sub-inspector of police, delivered rice, flour, wheat, pulses, spices and even two packs of mishti doi to the couple.“They blessed me profusely. I felt so humbled,” Sandip said. “I have assured the couple that I would check on them again.”The police have also issued passes to Anjan’s friend so that he can visit the couple. “I can’t thank the police enough,” Anjan said.",2020-04-27 21:54:00
444,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Howrah samaritan support for stuck migrants - Telegraph India,"More than 100 migrant workers stranded in Howrah’s Tikiapara are living on food from a community kitchen that has come up at Rebecca Belilious English Institution, a day-boarding school for the underprivileged.The workers — who hail from Malda and Murshidabad in Bengal and Katihar, Gaya and other places in Bihar —turn up at the school every evening with tokens and utensils to get rice, dal and an occasional curry of seasonal vegetables.Most of them used to work at construction sites in Tikiapara. Some ferried loads on vans and a few pulled rickshaws and did carpentry jobs.Balchand Mistiri, 35, a carpenter from Gaya, had reached Bengal a year ago. “I keep a portion of the dinner for lunch as well. I have six children back home. I don’t know how my wife is sustaining the family. I want to go home at the earliest. My wife has been telling me that it is better to die together than live separately with so much anxiety.”Mamoon Akhtar of Samaritan Help Mission, the NGO that set up the kitchen on April 14, said no work meant no pay for the workers. “Work has stopped indefinitely, choking their daily income and the chance of two square meals a day.”The number of people queuing up for food has been on the rise. On Wednesday, around 12kg rice and 6kg daal were prepared in the kitchen, manned by over a dozen volunteers. “There is not much of a difference in the people that we have been working for and these migrant workers,” Akhtar said.“These people (the stranded workers) share small rented rooms. They used to eat at hotels that are closed now. Most don’t have enough money to buy food. The bulk of what they had earned, they have sent home. This emergency has cast a cloud on their survival,” a volunteer from the NGO said. The number of migrant workers was above 500 when the lockdown was announced. They wanted to return home but had to stay back for want of transport.The NGO had coordinated with the administration to arrange for mini trucks, on which around 350 people went home. “The workers underwent medical tests at a hospital before they were allowed to leave for their homes,” Akhtar said.But that was three days into the lockdown. Things have changed since then. Howrah, which has been declared a sensitive containment area following multiple reports of Covid-19, is one of the first places near Calcutta where Section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed to enforce the lockdown.“There are many more workers stranded in Tikiapara. Our volunteers are trying to reach out to them. But any coordination is difficult now,' Akhtar, a school dropout who had set up the NGO in 2001, said.The NGO works for residents of slums in Tikiapara; running a school for 3,500 children, mostly of unlettered parents, primary health centres, and a vocational training centre, where women get lessons in tailoring to help them earn a living.",2020-04-27 21:54:00
445,Gautam Mukhopadhyay,Coronavirus lockdown: The fresh cancer challenge   - Telegraph India,"Cancer patients and their families are among the worst affected in this Covid crisis. Those who have been diagnosed during this period seek immediate treatment but are held back because of logistic and treatment availability issues.Patients who have been undergoing treatment are deeply troubled as their treatment is being discontinued in many cases. However, the follow-up patients are less distressed as they can wait till the lockdown is over, unless there is development of new symptomatology during this period.The oncology fraternity is also deeply concerned that in spite of their best efforts, adequate therapy is being delayed for obvious reasons. In such adversity, solutions need to be provided to tide over the crisis.CommunicationTo allay fears, communication among cancer patients, oncologists and cancer institutions are of utmost importance. Each case needs to be individualised and treatment options explained in detail.The use of social media and telecommunication is crucial during this period. Many issues related to treatment and its outcome can be discussed, which may solve many unresolved issues. Care of mental health and general well-being should also be taken care of.Cancer surgerySurgery is the primary treatment option for many early localised cancers and should be performed once adequate work-up is done. In present circumstances, operating major cases is a much higher risk because of Covid-19. Adequate precautions in the hospital and operating rooms are mandatory. However, ideal equipment, facilities related to the case and adequate staff safety measures may not be available at all places. This leads to enormous additional risk to operate routine non-emergency cases during this period.Cases which merit urgent and emergency surgical intervention have to be performed irrespective of logistic issues as they are life-saving. The delay in operating elective cases have been of great concern during this period.In such situations, medical options are being sought to tide over some time for the lockdown to get lifted. A detailed discussion with the patient and family is mandatory to arrive at a decision. Such an alarming situation has not arisen in the past and thus, specific guidelines for routine surgical interventions are few.Medical treatment optionsRadiotherapy and chemotherapy alone or in combination can be curative in many cancers and thus, delay in starting therapy is usually not recommended.Those patients undergoing radiotherapy need to visit the hospital five days a week for around six weeks. At the present juncture frequent travelling for a sick person is a huge challenge, specially for those who travel from faraway places. It maybe wise for such patients to arrange to stay close to the hospital concerned, though that may add significant financial burden.In our country financial anaemia and cancer make a lethal combination. Similar problems are faced by patients undergoing chemotherapy. Although many patients have to report once every three weeks, the toxicity associated with chemotherapy can be troublesome. Also, there is the problem of acquiring chemotherapy drugs during this period for logistic reasons.All these problems need to be addressed and dealt with adequately in consultation with the treating oncologist. The physician concerned needs to assess the entire situation and offer solutions accordingly. It maybe best to access treatment close to home, if feasible.Pledge for supportOn many occasions, ostracism of cancer patients and families have been reported at various times. However, today’s situation is entirely different and it is a battle of survival for all. The situation demands real cooperation between all levels of society, beyond just verbal assurances.It is time for deep introspection and the real pledge for support between people. Today, the entire medical profession is fighting to save sick people, risking their own lives. It is really unfortunate that some sections of society are ill-treating medical professionals. Such people should be given exemplary punishment and the government must implement all laws in this regard.Also, government and private healthcare must unite to serve and corporate healthcare will have to think beyond just commercial gains. Cancer families are already distressed; they need help and compassion, which they truly deserve. Personal interest is important but not at the cost of caregivers and cancer patients. It is now time for good sense to prevail.Gautam Mukhopadhyay is a surgical oncologist and secretary of the Bengal Oncology Foundation",2020-04-27 21:54:00
446,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus lockdown: Baguiati market curbs over crowds - Telegraph India,"Five markets in Baguiati that had been attracting large crowds every day were shut down on Monday, a Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation official said.All shopkeepers in the Baguiati market complex along VIP Road, VIP supermarket, AC market, Baguiati Purana bazaar (old market complex) and Chawlpatty bazaar have been asked to keep their shops closed.Every morning and evening, hundreds had been converging at these markets where everything from vegetables to mobile phone covers are available, the corporation official said. “We had no option but to shut down these markets…. Neither repeated announcements nor measures such as drawing circles for people to wait for their turn in front of shops worked. People did not pay any heed to requests to maintain social distancing norms.”Pranay Kumar Ray, the mayoral council member in charge of health, said there were close to 700 shops in the four markets.Earlier this month, Metro had reported about the corporation shifting out 160-odd stalls from their usual spots in the Baguiati market to a nearby fairground to control people who gathered in large numbers in violation of lockdown rules.Another temporary market in Baguiati’s Jagatpur had been shut down on April 16. The corporation is looking for grounds to shift some stalls selling grocery, vegetables and fruits for a few days, Ray said.On Tuesday, a civic team sprayed disinfectants to sanitise Baguiati Main Road and some stretches of VIP Road apart from some shops in the closed markets.Two separate teams equipped with portable spraying units disinfected the shops. “We will sanitise the markets once more and decide on throwing them open only after we figure out a way to control the crowds and make people follow the social distancing protocol,” Ray said.Swapan Kumar Mondal, the secretary of the VIP supermarket shopkeepers’ association, said the main entry/exit points to the market had been sealed. Although shops had “No Mask No Goods” signboards, a sizeable chunk of people had been turning up without masks, Mondal said.“The shutdown will hit finances but we don’t want to take a chance. Once the market reopens we will ask shopkeepers to be more vigilant and not to sell anything to anyone who is without a mask,” he said. “We plan to keep sanitisers and washing facilities near the gates once we are allowed to reopen.”",2020-04-27 21:55:00
447,Subhajoy Roy,Sample centres to address Howrah Covid-19 concern - Telegraph India,"Four swab sample collection centres are being set up in the Howrah municipal area so people suspected to be carriers of the novel coronavirus need not visit hospital for a test, officials of the civic body said on Monday.Now, such people have to visit a designated Covid-19 hospital, where they are admitted before their swab samples are taken. If they test negative, they are discharged. If the report is positive, they are treated at the hospital.Four sample collection centres are being set up in as many ward health units of the Howrah Municipal Corporation in the first phase. The units are in some of the worst-hit pockets in Howrah city.They are located near Aloka cinema and in Round Tank Lane in Shibpur, on Tikiapara’s Belilious Road and in Salkia’s Sitanath Bose Lane. The centres are likely to start collecting samples from Wednesday or Thursday. “During our surveillance, we found that many people were not keen on visiting hospital to get themselves tested because of a psychological barrier. So, we decided to open sample collection units at the local level. People may not be opposed to visiting a health centre near home,” said Bijin Krishna, the administrator of the civic body. Officials of the municipal corporations in Calcutta and Howrah have complained that many people are reluctant to visit hospital for tests even if surveillance or contact tracing by the civic bodies threw up the hint that they had contracted the virus.The step to start sample collection at the local level, close to one’s home, gains significance against this backdrop. Officials at the Howrah civic body said eight wards — 6, 15, 19, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 36 (comprising pockets in Shibpur, Salkia and around the Howrah Maidan) — were among the worst affected. Around 80 per cent of the 106 coronavirus positive cases in Howrah city have been reported from these places. “The four sample collection centres are in these wards. Each centre is for two wards,” an official said.The corporation started a door-to-door survey of all households in these eight wards on Monday.“Our field workers will bring information from the community. They will also ask people with symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulty and runny nose to visit health clinics. Doctors there will examine these people and, if needed, their samples will be collected,” said one official.The corporation has set up 175 two-member teams to do the survey in the eight wards.Field monitors working with the World Health Organisation are accompanying the survey teams for better fact finding, the official said.",2020-04-27 21:55:00
448,TT Bureau, Bengal clears Covid-19 air on private hospitals - Telegraph India,"Private hospitals not designated as Covid-19 treatment centres can treat such patients if they follow guidelines laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Bengal’s chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Tuesday.State government sources said an advisory on this would be sent to private hospitals.“If a private hospital has the necessary facilities and enough beds to treat Covid-19 patients, it can. If someone can pay and get treated at a private hospital, why should he or she go to a government facility like MR Bangur Hospital?” Sinha said. There were no clear guidelines about whether private hospitals not reserved for Covid-19 patients can treat people with coronavirus infection. But many such hospitals have Covid-19 patients in their isolation units. The state government has requisitioned nearly 70 private hospitals across Bengal to treat Covid-19 patients. To get admitted there, one has to be referred by the state government. So, there is an increasing demand among people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, cough and severe acute respiratory infection to get admitted at any of the private hospitals not reserved for coronavirus patients.The Telegraph has reported that private hospitals in Calcutta are being flooded with such requests but the isolation units in most of them are full.One private hospital has kept its isolation beds for patients who come for other treatments but test positive for Covid-19.“If we increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients and those with symptoms, how can we treat other patients?” the CEO of a private hospital asked.An official of another hospital said patients were calling them up and asking whether any Covid-19 patient was being treated there. “When we are saying ‘yes’, they are cancelling admission,” said the official.RefusalThe state government will issue an advisory to private hospitals and nursing homes urging them to ensure that people are not refused treatment, chief secretary Sinha said on Tuesday.“We will issue an advisory to the private hospitals….The private hospitals have to be more energetic as many  patients are returning without treatment. People are fac- ing problem. Please see that this does not happen,” said Sinha.",2020-04-28 21:20:00

450,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Call for hospital for doctors to be studied - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday addressed the concerns of doctors about their safety while treating Covid-19 patients and their own treatment facilities.In a two-hour meeting with representatives of the Indian Medical Association and other doctors’ organisations at Nabanna, the chief minister promised to look into their demand for a designated hospital to treat doctors and other health workers if they get infected by the novel coronavirus, doctors who attended the meeting said. State government sources said Ohio Hospital in New Town, which the health department had recently requisitioned to set up a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre, could be reserved for doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers.Mamata told the doctors that the government would ensure that personal protective equipment (PPE) was made available to all doctors at the state-run medical colleges.Junior doctors had recently expressed resentment over the lack of PPE after several of them were infected with the coronavirus at the NRS Medical College and Hospital and the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. The doctors’ organisations told the chief minister that doctors across Calcutta as well as in the districts wanted to reopen their personal clinics but they needed protective gear such as N95 masks and abundant supply of hand sanitisers to protect themselves from the virus.“There was a suggestion from doctors to make N95 masks available at fair price shops so that doctors who run private clinics can get those easily. The chief minister has promised to look into the matter,” said a doctor present at the meeting.Most doctors closed their private chambers after the outbreak had started and lockdown been imposed. That left thousands who visit the clinics for consultation inconvenienced.A number of doctors said immunisation of children had been affected. “At hospitals, doctors are provided with personal protective equipment. But it's difficult to procure PPE and N95 masks for private clinics because those are not readily available,” said physician Amitabha Saha. The gear is a must at private clinics because many of them are so small that social distancing is difficult to maintain.At the meeting, the doctors requested the government to prepare guidelines for reuse of PPEs and N95 masks and to train them in wearing those. The chief minister apparently told senior doctors to boost the morale of their junior colleagues through counselling. “The CM asked officials to ensure more transport facilities for doctors and nurses from home to hospital and back,” said a doctor. The doctors also requested Mamata to extend the lockdown. “She said the state was considering an extension in the containment zones,” said a representative of a doctors’ organisation.“The meeting was fruitful and all doctors’ organisations thanked the CM for listening to their concerns and her promise to address those. She also promised to frequently meet the doctors,” said Santanu Sen, state secretary of the IMA in Bengal and Trinamul Congress Rajya Sabha MP.Another request from the doctors was to allow sample collection for Covid-19 tests at OPDs.Meeting points⚫ More PPEs and N95 masks for doctors⚫ Reopening of private clinics ⚫ Designated hospital for treating doctors, nurses, other health workers  infected with Covid-19⚫ Sample collection  for Covid-19 tests at OPDs⚫ Guidelines on reuse of masks and PPE⚫ Augmenting plasma therapy process",2020-04-28 21:31:00

The two-year full-time residential MBA programme is for students.Classes started on April 20 and teachers have been holding classes from their homes using online platforms such as Zoom. They use the licensed version of Zoom, the official said. The “Covidian batch” has 68 students from 20 industry sectors with average work experience of 8.33 years.“The admission to the programme had been completed several months ago before the onset of the pandemic. Since this is a one-year programme, the course had to be started in time…. Unlike the summer school, we did not want to put the programme on hold,” the official said.IIM Calcutta had in late March “indefinitely” postponed the summer school programme because of the coronavirus outbreak. Classes for the Teaching Summer School/Pre-Summer School/Research Summer School were to start from the end of April. The institute has now started the process of refunding fees.The institute had checked with its 68 candidates whether they were comfortable with attending classes online, another official said. “Once they gave their confirmation regarding adequate access to the Net, we decided to hold the classes online.”At the moment, classes for term I are being held. Seven teachers will hold classes over six to eight weeks. “If the situation improves we can restore classes on the campus,” the official said.Institute director Anju Seth flagged off the programme after an address by the chairperson of the programme, Manju Jaiswall, on the morning of April 20.The institute has worked out a detailed plan to ensure students’ learning was not compromised, an official said. “Students get an alert about classes timings. Accordingly, a schedule is worked out. Teachers have been trained to hold classes online,” a professor said.The Joka institute has resumed online interviews of candidates for admission to its two-year residential MBA programme.The Telegraph had on March 28 reported that the B-school  had cancelled online and in-person interviews that were to be held in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta.",2020-04-28 22:19:00
456,Jhinuk Mazumdar,"Coronavirus lockdown: Future uncertain, Class XII pupils seek help - Telegraph India","Psychiatrists are receiving calls from board examinees, especially those in Class XII, expressing their fears and anxiety as they stare at an uncertain future.In one instance, an “academically bright” student tried to self-harm and had to be taken to hospital. On recovery, the student — a top scorer in school — said she felt “cheated” by the circumstances.  Another Class XII girl had to be admitted to hospital because of what doctors described as a  “panic attack”.Students seem to be feeling they have “no control” over their lives and are also worried that their admission to colleges abroad will be jeopardised, psychiatrists said.Some of the academically brighter students are apprehensive that if they cannot write exams, they will not get a subject of their choice, a psychiatrist said. The calls became more frequent with the extension of the lockdown beyond three week. Some students had to be prescribed medicines, another psychiatrist said. “They are feeling a total lack of control on their lives. Till some time back, they knew their exam dates, but now there is complete uncertainty and they are losing focus and getting anxious,” said psychiatrist Sanjay Garg. The students’ complaints include inability to sleep, loss of appetite, lack of concentration, racing heart and shortness of breath. High achievers are among the more anxious ones, doctors said.“Many high achievers are feeling that everything is at stake because they have their eyes set on a goal and now they fear that their whole plan for the future has gone awry,” Garg said.Psychiatrist Praveen Kumar said high achievers are “perfectionists” and they tend to constantly compare themselves with their peers. “Those who are high achievers look for predictability but since the situation is uncertain they might be more at risk of anxiety,” Kumar said.The role of parents is crucial.  “If parents focus more on exams and results, it increases anxiety in students. If they focus on other things such as character and behaviour, it can be less taxing for students,” Kumar said. Psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram said the idea is to assure students and make then understand that they are not alone in this situation.“We are asking them to compartmentalise their thoughts — study and be prepared for exams (because many of them are not studying) and do not delve into something you cannot control,” he said.Ram urged parents to play a supportive role and let the children talk about their anxieties. “Children should be allowed to articulate their feelings and not be brushed away.”Online fun for childrenThe state child rights commission will launch an online programme  where actors, authors, poets and singers will tell a story, recite a poem or sing a song for children during the summer vacation.Goromer Chhuti will be a creative space on the commission’s website and Facebook page where a new activity will be uploaded almost every day, starting  May 1.",2020-04-28 22:19:00

460,The Telegraph,"Coronavirus outbreak: Sir was all warmth, elegance and skill - Telegraph India","Sisir Mondal, the orthopaedic surgeon who had tested positive for Covid-19, died at AMRI Salt Lake on Monday night. He was 69. Rahul Jain, internal medicine expert and Mondal’s colleague at Belle Vue Clinic, reminiscences his Sir. When someone always starts a conversation with you, you know that the person is amiable, friendly and open. When someone can disarm you with a smile and a gentle nod, you immediately know that you are in the vicinity of a person that you can approach easily.These were my first thoughts when I first met Sisir Sir in 2005 when I had joined Belle Vue Clinic.Sisir Sir was a very jolly- natured man. He had a great flair for dressing sharply. He was fond of tweed and houndstooth jackets. He could carryWindsor knotted jacquard silk ties with the same elan as he could a tussar dhuti-panjabi. Sir carefully maintained a very conscious sartorial elegance at all times. On the professional front, Sir was a calm presence which could ease the frayed nerves of a patient with polytrauma with his mild demeanour and swan-like ease. He was a reputable, kind considerate and busy surgeon who enjoyed the faith of his loyal patients. He was very good with his surgical skills and brought many ailing people on their feet. He was well respected by all his professional colleagues. A religious man, Sir lived a happy and content life which reflected on his visage.Sir was an avid ‘debater’ in the doctors’ room adjacent to the ICCU on the seventh floor of our hospital “old building”. He would talk on topics as varied as cinema and politics to more mundane things such as norompak sweets, with his colleagues. I recall once how sir rebuked me gently for not eating enough sweets, “mishti khele diabetes hoy  na”.In January last year, Sir had hosted us at Bengal Club. As was his custom, he made sure that he put an extra sweet or two on my dinner plate. Sir was gracious and flamboyant in all he did, whether in his chamber or in his persona. We always received an extra helping of warmth in his presence. Perhaps his contemporaries knew him better than me. I only got to see a small facet of his persona which I have narrated briefly. Alas, I know I will not see Sir again. The veteran of many a tough battle fought and won in the operation theatre, sir lost his last one battling an invisible enemy. Fate has dealt a cruel blow and snatched a frontline Covid warrior away from us.I will miss that booming voice and that exuberant smile.Sir leaves behind a son who is a young and dynamic orthopaedic surgeon, Soham, who has to fill very large boots. Rest in peace Sir. Condolences to the family. Amar pronam neben.",2020-04-28 22:31:00

He had told a civic official who had visited his house recently to enquire about his health and to find out if he needed any essential items that he wanted to donate “something” to help in the fight against the novel coronavirus.“This is an unprecedented crisis and we simply cannot sit back and do nothing in the hope that it will pass. I had witnessed first-hand the impact of the Bengal famine in 1943,” the 99-year-old who walks without any help said. “I was just into my first job… I have some very disturbing memories of the famine.”“Back then people had to walk for miles begging for food and rice starch. I remember people fighting over the smallest of morsels. The times have changed but this is very similar… we are facing a disturbing situation,” Chatterjee said.His son Sabyasachi, 72, lives in Delhi and his two grandsons are in Mumbai. The elder of the two, Deep, 42, stays and works in Mumbai. Sayan, 32, works for a bank in Hong Kong; but he is stuck in his brother’s house because of the lockdown, Chatterjee said.His neighbour Manjusha Das Ghosh said she had been thinking of donating to the fund but decided to go ahead with it after word reached her that Chatterjee had got in touch with councillor Roy.Both Chatterjee and Ghosh said they contributed to the relief fund as they felt it would be more effective in the fight against the virus.Minister Bose, who is also the Salt Lake MLA, said he was moved by the gesture. “Times like these bring out the best in us.

463,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Abundant caution behind reluctance to hand over bodies - Telegraph India,"When a Covid-19 patient dies, there is no family member at the bedside. Visitors are not allowed near such a patient and family members are most likely to be in a quarantine facility far away. Confusion prevails in such a situation and rumours thrive. The Telegraph tried to find out the protocol after a patient infected with the coronavirus dies. Hospital administrators and officials of the health department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said bodies of Covid-19 patients were not handed over to family members to ensure no one contracted the virus while handling them. Administrators of hospitals said they were handing over bodies to officials of the health department and the civic body. A CMC official said: “We have dedicated hearses to carry the bodies of Covid-19 patients. The drivers of the hearses wear PPE.”If the body is handed to the family, a relative has to ensure that the hearse they hire is driven by someone wearing PPE. “How will the family ensure that? To avoid these complications, it has been decided that the state government or the civic body will transport the bodies from hospitals to burning ghats or burial grounds,” the CMC official said. The transportation and cremation/burial are done following the guidelines issued by the Centre and the state government. The guidelines, however, mention that a body can be handed over to the family after taking all precautions. “Handing over a body to the family would require the presence of someone from the CMC with the relatives to ensure that no one removes the covering and the protocol is not flouted at any point between the hospital and the crematorium or burning ghat. It is better that we complete the task,” an official said.The guidelines mention that after a Covid-19 patient’s death, the body must be placed “in leak-proof plastic body bag. The exterior of the body bag can be decontaminated with 1% hypochlorite. The body bag can be wrapped with a mortuary sheet or sheet provided by the family members”. “The body, secured in a body bag, exterior of which is decontaminated poses no additional risk to the staff transporting the dead body,” the guidelines say.The CMC official said mishandling of the bag could lead to dangerous consequences. The guidelines say families should be counselled and their sentiments respected during the entire process.The bodies of Covid-19 patients are cremated at Dhapa or buried at a burial ground in Bagmari, the official said.Large gatherings are not allowed during the cremation or burial. “Family members can later collect the ashes because they do not pose any risk,” the official said.The guidelines state: “The main driver of transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets. There is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling body”.  A CMC official said family members often wanted to see the face of their loved ones one last time. Though the guidelines allow that, the personnel handling the body often do not want to put themselves at risk by opening and closing the zip. “We explain to them very sensitively that our hands are tied. The families cooperate and they understand the importance of letting the body reach the crematorium/burial ground fast,” the civic official said.Safety tips⚫ No large gathering at crematorium/burial ground⚫ No embalming of body⚫ Health worker handling a body should practise hand hygiene and wear PPE⚫ Those handling bodies should be trained in infection prevention control practices",2020-04-29 21:36:00
464,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Rip-off cry on gear - Telegraph India,"Some private hospitals, not the ones designated as Covid-19 treatment centres, have been accused of overcharging patients for personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks. State health department officials said they had received complaints against some private hospitals and warned them against profiteering from PPE and masks.“There have been allegations that some hospitals are charging a patient for 10 PPE daily. The reason is housekeeping staff, too, need to wear PPE. But the number looks too high,” said  a health department official. A few hospitals, he said, are charging more than Rs 12,000 a day for PPE. Some hospitals are even charging non-Covid-19 patients for the protective gear.The officials clarified that the allegations are against those private hospitals that have not been requisitioned by the government for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The cost of treatment at the hospitals that have been requisitioned by the government and converted into dedicated Covid-19 treatment centres is reimbursed by the state government. “We are getting reports of billing problems at private hospitals. Patients are being charged exorbitantly for PPE,” said the official.Sources said that in most cases insurance companies were not agreeing to pay the charges for PPE, so the amount is taken from patients.Private hospitals said they were spending a lot to buy PPE. The CEO of a private hospital said they had spent Rs 1 crore to buy PPE since March.“Initially, a PPE cost as high as Rs 2,000. Now, many local companies are making these items and the price has come down. But the volume of PPE used has gone up manifold,” he said.Add to that the decrease in the number of patients in non-Covid hospitals. Many hospitals said they are running at 30 per cent capacity and are unable to bear the cost of PPE.“We are charging patients the cost price of PPE. We are facing huge pressure from doctors, who are not agreeing to see patients without PPE because healthcare workers are getting infected around the world,' said Rupak Barua, the group CEO of AMRI Hospitals.The group, he said, is spending about Rs 50 lakh every month on PPE.“The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission is keeping a watch on the situation. At the moment, our primary concern is treatment of patients. But at the same time, we have to ensure patients are not fleeced,” an official in the health department said.The commission is the regulatory body for private hospitals and nursing homes. “If we get complaints of overcharging on PPE against any hospital, we'll definitely look into it,” said retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the commission.",2020-04-29 21:45:00
465,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus lockdown: Options before CMC as board expiry nears - Telegraph India,"The tenure of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board ends on May 7 and there is no provision in law that allows an extension of its tenure or appointment of an administrator to run Bengal’s largest civic body, government officials said. It means Calcutta could cease to have a mayor and the 144 wards their councillors from May 8. State government officials said that in all likelihood an administrator would be appointed to run the corporation once the tenure of the board lapsed. Officials said there were two options before the government. It can issue an ordinance amending the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980 to pave the way for the appointment of an administrator. “An ordinance has to be issued to amend the act because the Assembly is not in session,” an official said.The other option is to extend the term of the elected board. That would need an amendment to the Constitution.  An official of the government said Article 243-U of the Constitution, which deals with the duration of municipal corporations/municipalities, does not have any provision for extending the tenure of an elected board. “Article 243-U is unambiguous that the tenure is of five years from the date of its first meeting and ‘no longer’. The words 'no longer' leave no room for interpretation. The duration ends after five years,” the official said. “In all likelihood an ordinance will be issued to allow the appointment of an administrator.” State government officials asserted that the lack of an elected board would not affect the functioning of the various departments of the CMC such as health, engineering, solid waste management and water supply. “The doctors, officials and engineers of the civic body are well equipped to run the system. They have been working for so many years. The state government will obviously have a supervisory role. It should not affect daily services in any way,” a CMC official said. The tenure of the elected boards of 91 other civic bodies in the state will end around the same time as the CMC.“These municipal bodies are governed by the West Bengal Municipal Act, which allows the appointment of an administrator,” an official said. The Howrah Municipal Corporation is being run by an administrator since December 2018. The Howrah Municipal Corporation Act, too, allows the appointment of an administrator.Caution on sanitisation tunnelThe municipal affairs department of Bengal has cautioned municipal corporations  and municipalities on “sanitisation tunnels” at the entrance to various markets and buildings. The civic bodies must ensure that the chemicals sprayed on people passing through the tunnels are safe for use on humans, the department said in an order issued on Wednesday.It has also mentioned that sodium hypochlorite solution of any concentration should not be used in the tunnels. The order asked the civic bodies to ensure that “such tunnels, if used or proposed, only use disinfectants which are certified to be safe on human body”. Appropriate authorities such as the state pollution control board or the department of health has to certify such disinfectants. “These chemicals (such as sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide) are meant to be used as disinfectants on solid surfaces like that of metal. They are not meant to be used on humans,” said Sudarsan Neogi, professor of chemical engineering, petroleum engineering and environmental science at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. “They will not be effective on humans and give a  false sense of security to those who pass through such tunnels. Sodium hypochlorite can affect the human skin.” ",2020-04-29 21:52:00
466,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Job offer to 12 revoked at Jadavpur University - Telegraph India,"A global analytics consultancy firm has withdrawn its job offer to 12 engineering students of Jadavpur University, citing constraints because of the economic downslide caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a university official said.   The company, headquartered in the US, had offered jobs to 12 students of the university’s computer science and engineering, electrical, information technology, metallurgy and construction engineering departments in its data analytics, marketing analytics wing last December. The students had been promised a compensation package of Rs 7lakh per annum and were expected to join the firm in July after the publication of the final-semester results, a JU official said. “Since the company focuses on areas such as innovative analytics, pricing analytics and predictive modelling, it had hired the the students for the analytics wing.  The students were supposed to move to the company’s Bangalore office in the initial phase,” the official said.The company contacted the students last Friday.“The company, in its communication to the students last week, cited constraints in view of the economic scenario for withdrawing the offer,”   Jadavpur University (JU) pro-vice chancellor Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya told Metro. The company has been visiting JU for campus recruitment for four years. A former student of the university, who holds a senior position in the company, had been behind the recruitment drive. He told a senior JU official that the company had stalled recruitment across the globe.A professor of the electrical engineering department said it was worrying that students from such coveted streams as computer science and engineering and electrical engineering were being denied job offers. “Companies make the best of offers to snap up the pick of the lot. But now they are being denied the offer,” said the professor. Three of the 12 students are from his department.Other companies, too, must be facing similar crisis, another professor said, apprehending more such decisions. “We won’t be surprised if other companies follow suit. Either they would withdraw the offers or retain only a part of the offers made,” he said. The news of job offers being withdrawn was an added blow, considering that some companies have already stopped internships offered to third-year BTech students because of the bleak scenario, a JU official said.Internships often lead to job opportunities. But now a premier institute may be staring at a situation where its engineering graduates find no takers.VC Suranjan Das said he has written to the company that has withdrawn job offers on Tuesday. “I certainly appreciate your constraints in view of the unprecedented global economic scenario caused by the corona pandemic…. I  request you to push the joining date of the selected candidates by a few months. The problem is once a student is selected in the campus placement drive, he or she is not allowed to sit for the subsequent placement drive,” the letter states.An official said JU is not alone. Job offers have been withdrawn at IIMs as well. “The problem is no one knows when the situation would improve. Earlier we have seen that after a dry spell, the job scenario has improved in the subsequent year. But this time the uncertainty would not end easily,” he said.",2020-04-29 21:58:00

There are other patients in the dialysis ward. They will be at risk if a suspect is kept in the same unit. That is why her family members were asked to shift her,” the spokesperson said.The woman was later taken to MR Bangur Hospital, a designated Covid-19 treatment centre, where she was admitted in the isolation ward. Her swab test results are awaited.The same day chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said the state government would issue an advisory to private hospitals and nursing homes urging them not to deny treatment to patients. “We will issue an advisory to the private hospitals…. The private hospitals have to be more energetic as many patients are returning without treatment. People are facing problems. Please see that this does not happen,” Sinha had said at Nabanna.The woman, a Lake Town resident, has been undergoing dialysis at Apollo thrice a week for 18 months, his 26-year-old son told The Telegraph.“On Tuesday, her health worsened…. We rushed her to Apollo before noon for dialysis,” said her son.Some tests were conducted in the emergency department. “A doctor said my mother had a chest infection, which made her a Covid-19 suspect. I was told to take her to MR Bangur Hospital and get the necessary tests done,” the son said.“If the test result is positive, she will be kept there. If the result is negative, you can bring her back for dialysis or any other treatment,” the son quoted the doctor as telling him. Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals is a designated Covid-19 testing centre.

She was given an injection but the pain continued,” Sardar said.As his wife was unable to sit or stand, he took her back home so that she could rest comfortably, he said.Around 9am, the couple decided to go back to the hospital because they thought labour pain had started. “My mother-in-law, Sarbani, and I were seated behind while one of my friends drove the auto and another sat beside him,” Sardar said. “She gave birth to the boy while we were on Fern Road. For a moment I did not know what to do… then it suddenly struck me… and I dialled 100. I never thought we will get such  help from the police during this crisis.”",2020-04-29 22:51:00
470,TT Bureau,Coronavirus lockdown: CM Mamata Banerjee says criminals’ faith not a factor - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said stern action will be taken against criminals, regardless of their caste, creed or religion.The chief minister was speaking in Nabanna on Wednesday against the backdrop of Tuesday’s attack on police at Tikiapara in Howrah when they tried to enforce the lockdown.At least 10 people have been arrested and four detained in connection with the assault on the cops. The police said a search is on for others involved in the attack.At least two police personnel were seriously injured in a mob attack on Belilious Road when the police had tried to enforce the lockdown in the area. Two police vehicles were damaged in the violence, the police said.A Howrah court on Wednesday remanded the arrested — booked for violating the lockdown, arson, deterring a public servant from performing his/her duty — in police custody.“There was an incident in Tikiapara. It should not have happened. I have told the police to take stern action, to book those who are the real culprits without harassing the innocent,” Mamata said on Wednesday. “A crime is a crime. We do not see caste, creed or religion. This is Bengal. We love everyone. But if someone commits a crime, the person is a criminal,” the chief minister added.The police in Howrah have been maintaining strict vigil since Section 144 of the CrPC was imposed on April 1 to ensure lockdown rules are not violated.

472,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Relief for Sinthee poor from JU alumnus - Telegraph India,"A teacher in a wheelchair has stepped forward to provide the poor with food in Sinthee on the city’s northern outskirts.The teacher of Bagnan College in Howrah has activated his NGO to deliver essential items to cops at the police station running an initiative to feed the poor during the lockdown. The NGO has supplied rice, pulses, potatoes, soya beans, and sanitiser bottles to the police for distribution among rickshaw-pullers and the elderly.Bubai Bag — a former Jadavpur University student with Locomotor Disability (restriction in limb movement) — got to know of the police initiative on the university’s community radio, 90.8MHz. “I contacted the teacher, Iman Kalyan Lahiri, overseeing the radio operation so that funds can be shared,” Bag said.The history teacher, who did his PhD from JU, founded the NGO, Aalo, along with a group of former students of JU and the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in 2011 to offer scholarships to poor students.He and other members of the NGO created a corpus, “Corona Relief Funds”, once the lockdown was announced. “This pandemic has made the lives of the poor more difficult. When I heard about the police initiative to help rickshaw-pullers with food, I told our members that we should chip in from our funds,” Bag said.Prabir Chandra Mandal, the additional OC of Sinthee police station, said cops had been providing 200 people, including rickshaw-pullers, with food since late March. Rickshaw-pullers are now without jobs in the absence of people on roads, the officer said.“When the college teacher contacted us we asked him to help us with essential items instead of money,” Mandal said.Cops collected the items through one of the NGO members who lives in Tallah. The items were distributed in the presence of the member in the Sinthee neighbourhood.“The help from Aalo is a recognition of our efforts,” an officer said.Cops prepare khichri on the police station premises and distribute it among rickshaw-pullers near Dum Dum Metro station and the Sinthee crossing. They also deliver grocery items to the homes of the elderly.The coming together of a former JU student and the police station through the JU community radio shows how individuals, institutions and the local administration can make a difference during the pandemic, JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said.The former student and his NGO have contributed to the JU “community kitchen”, which is being run by a group of students and research scholars to feed the poor in south Calcutta.",2020-04-29 23:09:00
473,Subhajoy Roy,ICMR changes coronavirus test protocol - Telegraph India,"The Indian Council of Medical Research has advised all states and union territories to begin antibody-based blood tests in addition to swab tests to identify patients with the novel coronavirus.The “rapid antibody-based blood tests” have been advised in clusters or where a large number of migrant workers are staying. Clusters are neighbourhoods from where multiple cases have been reported or where there are multiple contacts of a person who has tested positive for Covid-19, according to public health specialists.State chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said at a news conference on Saturday that the government was working on identifying clusters and hotspots in the state from where a large number of positive cases might emerge in the coming days.Swab tests — also called RT-PCR tests — are costlier and need more resources, according to microbiologists as well as public health specialists.Swab tests require trained personnel to collect the sample, microbiologists to conduct the tests and very good laboratories to get the right results. Also the turnaround time is more.On the other hand, any healthcare worker is trained to draw blood samples, according to microbiologists. In the rapid antibody-based blood tests, a drop of blood is taken on a strip. “The band of colour on the strip will reveal whether a person is infected. The results will come within 10 to 40 minutes. Also, they are cheaper,” a microbiologist said. In RT-PCR tests, it takes at least half a day for the results to come.A state government doctor said a south Calcutta neighbourhood from where three members of a family and a help had tested positive for the coronavirus could be a potential cluster. “Those who had tested positive had mingled with many people,” the doctor said.Another potential cluster could be a pocket in the southeastern part of the city, from where two positive cases had been reported. One of the patients died. “It could be classified as a hotspot. But it depends on how the expert committee appointed by the state government defines a hotspot or a cluster,” the doctor said.The reason for conducting tests in clusters is to do a primary screening to get an idea if the place has several people infected with the virus, a state health department official said.Anyone testing positive for the blood test will undergo “treatment in hospital or isolation as per protocol after a clinical assessment”. “Action as per protocol to be initiated for contact tracing,” the ICMR advisory says.Someone testing negative in the blood test may still have to undergo swab tests, according to the advisory. If the swab test result, too, is negative, the person is likely to be suffering from “non-Covid Influenza-like illness”, according to the advisory.Someone who tested negative in blood test but positive in the swab test will be considered as a “confirmed Covid-19 case”.",2020-05-04 20:33:00
475,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya,Coronavirus outbreak: Delivery of fruits of labour - Telegraph India,"The battle against invisibility is killing us. But we need vegetables. So it’s a great pleasure to see Jitendra Sau coming into the neighbourhood every morning, around 8am. Sau, about 40 — he is not absolutely sure about his age — is a vegetable seller who goes from house to house in the neighbourhood of Ballygunge Place every day. He has been doing so for decades, since he came to Calcutta as a small boy from his village in Siwan district of Bihar, where his family lives. A smiling man with a very large basket balanced on his head, he keeps his cool in the presence of the most demanding buyers, the sort who claim a special knowledge of vegetables. For some of his buyers now, he probably provides the only real social interaction of the day. As the woman downstairs in a building buys a huge amount of carrots and sweet potatoes, a plastic bag descends from the first floor, into which Shau stuffs in a few cucumbers, and then, thoughtfully, a handful of green chillies, a lemon and a small bunch of coriander leaves. Ah! You see the green salad! Sau was always greeted into the neighbourhood with pleasure. But before the coronavirus crisis, a few buyers would grumble a bit. Given the recent explosion of global cuisine everywhere, Sau would fall rather short of local expectations. He would always smilingly, but stoically, refuse to have anything fancy in his basket. Not even mushrooms. Only the basic: potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, bitter gourd, pumpkin and potol. Lots of potol. In fact, not even spinach or coriander leaves on some days. Now the neighbourhood is only grateful. He stays till around 11am or so, by which time his basket is emptied. Sau is around because he could not go back home to Goreakothi, his village in Siwan, where his wife lives with their three daughters and a son. His greater family lives there too. “What can I do? I couldn’t leave for my village,” he says, “after the sudden announcement of the lockdown,” says Sau, who lives in a neighbourhood house where he is also the caretaker. “Since I didn’t leave, I decided to keep selling the vegetables every day.” He doubles as the neighbourhood sattuwala, selling savoury sattu mix and sattu sharbat from a neighbourhood street till around three in the afternoon. Rather, he used to, till the lockdown. But his days remain as busy. Sau came to Calcutta in 1992, with his father and elder brother from Goreakothi. “So I hardly went to school.” His father had been living in the city since 1962. He also sold vegetables. In Calcutta, Sau and his brother shared a room with their father in Christianpara off Bondel Road, very near Ballygunge Place. But young Sau had once dreamt of bigger places.When he was around 20 — by that time he had already been married for a few years — he left for Delhi. He stayed near Mehrauli, selling tomatoes.“I used to sell a cart full of tomatoes every day. About 100 kg-150kg tomatoes.” But life was too expensive. “Twenty years ago I would spend Rs 60 on a plate of chhole bhatore.” So he came back to Calcutta, to live with his father again. They had to move out of Christianpara in 2008 when a promoter took over the plot they were living in. Sau’s father was paid Rs 1 lakh to move. That was when father and son moved into the Ballygunge Place house. In the years to come, Sau worked two shifts; selling vegetables in the morning and sattu in the afternoon. His father helped him with selling the sattu. “The business was good. We earned about Rs 450 to Rs 500 every day from selling vegetables and sattu,” says Sau. All the money went home. “Food is taken care of by the family with which I stay. I spend nothing.” He does not have time for anything that requires money: for films or any other entertainment. His father left early this year for their village. Then all hell broke loose with the coronavirus looming on the horizon. Now his days have changed drastically.“Previously after returning home in the afternoon, I would leave for Koley Market to buy vegetables for the next day.” But now he leaves for Sealdah market at 3am, in a small van. He returns in the same van. He asks me if he can buy train tickets for home on April 15. He has worries. His eldest daughter, who has finished school, was about to take a police service examination. He is insistent that she works, because a girl needs to; and a girl who works does not require a dowry.“I hope I get to see them soon,” he says. And promises to get me a pack of mushrooms if he spots one.",2020-05-04 20:33:00
476,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Helpline for the elderly in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A healthcare company and service provider will launch a helpline for the elderly on Monday to provide them with medical support and counselling.Many elderly live alone in Calcutta and the lockdown has left them vulnerable. Physicians, psychiatrists, doctors trained in palliative care and psychologists will be accessible over phone to answer their queries.Care Continuum, which provides the elderly and the infirm in the city with medical support and other services, will run the helpline 12 hours a day from Monday.“There are many elderly people who might need monitoring and screening by a doctor because of a chronic ailment. Many might not have access to doctors now… also, all their queries might not be regarding medication but about their health, which doctors can answer over phone,” Rana Mukherjee, a surgeon and one of the founder directors of Care Continuum, said.“We feel many of their queries could be related to the coronavirus and whether they should be worried about cough and cold or general health problems such as high sugar levels,” Mukherjee said.The phone consultation will be free.Care Continuum was started by Mukherjee and two others — Soma Bhattacharjee and Maitreyee Bhattacharjee.The helpline (7044074000) will be active from 8am to 8pm every day during the lockdown, of which three hours will be specifically dedicated to counselling (2pm-5pm).Many of the elderly are caught between the “devil and the deep blue sea” because staying at home gives rise to negative thoughts and stepping out has the risk of exposure, Mukherjee said. “There is a feeling of isolation, stress and hopelessness… more so for the elderly because they feel they have a short life to live and what if that is taken away… they could be dwelling on such negative emotions.”Five doctors will take calls in shifts. Many of the elderly in the city are alone; their children live abroad or in other cities. Attendants have stopped going to most homes because of the lockdown. Doctors feel it is important to reach out to such people because being alone can make them more vulnerable.“For many, their sense of hearing or vision is compromised… the lockdown has taken away from them whatever they could hear or see of the outside world… so, it takes a toll on them mentally,” Soma Bhattacharjee, a doctor in palliative medicine, said. “If they can reach out to people, they will feel others are concerned about them. Often, they don’t want to call their family members who might be abroad or might have their own challenges.”She, however, said the service should not be thought of as a substitute for seeking emergency care for the critically ill.If a doctor feels an elderly person needs to be admitted to hospital, Care Continuum can help with an ambulance and other admission formalities, Mukherjee said.",2020-05-04 20:33:00

Help is being offered not just to the families of students but other villagers as well, the principal said.The students are mostly from underprivileged families. Sons of daily wage agriculture labourers, they are first-generation learners.“We don’t want the students to suffer. We are trying to provide as much help as possible to the affected families. But the relief is being offered to other villagers as well,” Father Savio said. “Some of the villagers were in tears when they were handed over the food bag at a school in Paikhala.”Magurkhali, Debipur, Raghabpur, Shalpukur and Bakeswar are some of the villages where help has reached. Distribution of the food and other items will continue till next Friday.The relief work is being undertaken  in association with police and the panchayat.

478,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Madhyamik and HS classes on ABP Ananda - Telegraph India,"Virtual classes for students of classes IX to XII of state-aided Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools will be aired on ABP Ananda, the state government announced on Sunday.The school education department’s earlier plan to conduct the classes on DD Bangla was shelved after an assessment that tens of thousands of students may miss out on them. “We have decided to hold the programmes for school students on ABP Ananda from 3pm to 4pm between April 7 and 13,” education minister Partha Chatterjee told Metro on Sunday evening.ABP Ananda was chosen because of its wider reach.“The minister had announced on Friday that virtual classes would be aired on DD Bangla, but the department received inputs that airing the programme on ABP Ananda would be more feasible, considering that the latter has better viewership than DD Bangla. Better viewership would mean a larger number of students attending the classes. Besides, like DD Bangla it’s a free-to-air channel as well,” an official said.The channel has offered an hour-long slot from 3pm, which the department found convenient. “The channel will not charge us anything because the programme has been conceived in public interest,” said the official.  The decision to hold virtual classes was taken to make up for the lessons lost because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus.The format of the virtual classes would remain as announced by the minister on Friday. Students will be allowed to ask questions through email, WhatsApp or over phone. “The contact details would be shared with the channel so that they can advertise them,” said the official.",2020-05-04 20:43:00

Teachers are missing the human touch but they have noticed that the students are “comfortable” with technology and hence most tend to open up more. “Children are asking questions more openly. There’s greater interaction than there would be in the classroom. While that is a plus, online classes can only supplement a real classroom and students need to have contact with other children, listen to a class lecture, learn discipline and decorum. And all this can happen only when they are in school,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, the principal of La Martiniere for Girls. Delhi Public School Ruby Park has asked students not to log in to online classes using nicknames. “We want to maintain discipline and structure in the new set-up. Students cannot enter an online classroom using a nickname. The teacher should know who has logged in and he or she should be identified by their proper names,” said principal Joyoti Chaudhuri.Teachers of several schools have had parents popping in to check out the e-class, some have found students stretched out on a couch. With the rush to go to school missing, many students are waking up late and the mornings are mostly relaxed. “Attendance is better across classes and assignments are also coming on time,” said Seema Sapru, the principal of The Heritage School. But some schools have also noticed children not turning up online. “Some students might not have a personal space from where they can connect and might want to stay out,” said Apala Dutta, the principal of Birla Bharati. Principals and coordinators of schools are logging in to check on the classes. “Teachers are choosing segments that can be taught online. For instance, English teachers are taking literature, rather than grammar, lessons. For subjects like maths that need repetitive explanation, it is not easy,” said Sharmila Bose, the principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ High School.Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar, Sri Sri Academy, Garden High International School, Birla Bharati, Sri Sri Academy, Mahadevi Birla World Academy, Sushila Birla Girls' School,  Newtown School and Indus Valley World School are some of the schools that are conducting online classes.",2020-05-04 20:43:00
480,TT Bureau,Coronavirus fest with Diwali noise in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"At a time thousands in India are infected with Covid-19, several parts of the country responded to the Prime Minister’s call for a nationwide lumiére show by bursting high-decibel crackers like they do during Diwali. Some parts of Calcutta were no different.The city plunged into darkness, barring streetlights, at 9pm sharp. What followed was an explosion of noise, along with diyas that were lit and mobile flashlights that were switched on. The crackers kept bursting and after the first few minutes, it was impossible to keep track of the numbers that went up every minute.“I lost track after counting 20 crackers in 30 seconds. It was worse than Diwali,” said a Gariahat resident. Sky lanterns and crackers that go up and explode with sparkling flowers dotted the city sky, from Kasba to Kestopur, Behala to Barrackpore. Scores of Calcuttans thronged  balconies and terraces, lighting up the shells, sparklers, sky lanterns, everything associated with Diwali. Across parts of Kasba, several people burst crackers till 9.40 pm.Youths turned up in groups on Rajdanga Main Road to dance and clap while others flashed lights from their mobile phones. At Bansdroni, at least 10 people assembled on the terrace of an apartment building to chant “bhag corona bhag” before lighting a series of fireworks.“The sound of crackers was tough for my 80-year-old mother. She had come to the terrace to see a show of light but it turned out to be festival of noise. She had to go back to her room,” said a resident of Behala.In the north, Cossipore and Sovabazar were among the noisiest spots. Salt Lake was noisy, too. In Teghoria off VIP Road in Baguiati, people not only flocked to terraces to burst crackers, some of them assembled on the road to do the same.“As soon as the clock struck 9pm, the noise started, even before it was completely dark. It shows people had stored crackers and were waiting to have a go,” said a resident.Animals and birds had a tough time as well. Stray dogs were seen running helter-skelter across the city. Roman candles and other fireworks, including rockets, were lit by residents of Salt Lake. The noise from crackers woke up the birds who flew out emptying their nests.At a housing complex on the southern fringes near Garia, several people started bursting crackers while some  blew conch shells, along side lighting diyas and switching on phone torches.“I am not sure what’s the science behind this. But I don’t mind switching off the lights or holding my mobile flashlight for nine minutes. I was with my cousin and for once, we enjoyed without worrying,” said a college student who lives there.",2020-05-04 20:43:00
481,Subhajoy Roy,"1,425 beds for Covid-19 patients in Calcutta - Telegraph India","The four Covid-19 hospitals in the city will have a total of 1,425 beds, the state health department has announced.The New Town campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), MR Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge, an annexe building of AMRI Salt Lake and the Beleghata Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital have been designated as “state-level” hospitals for treatment of Covid-19. MR Bangur Hospital will have 1,100 beds, CNCI 192 beds, Beleghata ID Hospital 82 beds and AMRI Salt Lake 51 beds. The state government has also named 59 hospitals that will treat only Covid-19 patients in the first phase. Besides the four in Calcutta, the rest are in the districts. The four “state-level” hospitals in the city will act as referral units, where patients from other Covid-19 hospitals can be brought for treatment, a health department official said. “These four hospitals have better infrastructure to treat patients — more ventilators compared to most hospitals in the districts. Hence they have been designated as state-level hospitals where patients from the districts may be referred to,” the official said. Treatment of all other diseases has stopped in these four hospitals and fever clinics are being run instead.The hospitals are open to people who have fever or other symptoms. “A person with fever or any other symptom can come to the clinics at these hospitals. The person can consult a doctor there if she/he has fever, respiratory trouble or coughing. The admission or tests, though, would depend on the discretion of the doctors on duty,” the official said. A portion of AMRI Salt Lake has been taken over by the health department and converted into a Covid-19 hospital, a hospital official confirmed. All other patients are being treated in the other building of AMRI Salt Lake. Metro had reported on Thursday that the state planned to convert the New Town campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital and an annexe of AMRI Salt Lake into dedicated hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The health department has issued a notice, stating which patient should go to which of these hospitals. “A person suffering from Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) not yet tested for Covid-19” or “one who has tested positive for Covid-19 (SARI or otherwise) with moderate to severe symptoms” would be sent to MR Bangur Hospital. CNCI, New Town, will be for patients with “Covid-19-like symptoms but who have not yet been tested” or those who have tested positive but are low-risk. Beleghata ID Hospital and AMRI Salt Lake will deal with a patient “who has tested positive for Covid-1 9 with significant morbidity”. The five Covid-19 hospitals in Howrah include ILS Hospitals in Golabari, Sanjivani Nursing Home in Uluberia and ESI Hospital in Baltikuri.

483,Sanjay Mandal,Garments for Bangladesh hit coronavirus block - Telegraph India,"Tonnes of garments, worth crores of rupees and meant for export to Bangladesh on the eve of Id, are lying in warehouses in and around the city as both countries are on lockdown forced by the coronavirus.Id, to be held towards the end of May, is the biggest festival in Bangladesh. According to traders in Bangladesh, almost 80 per cent of the imported garments reach the country between the end of March and the start of May.Exporters and officials at Calcutta airport’s cargo wing said an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 tonnes of garments were ready to be sent to Bangladesh either by air or road but the coronavirus pandemic had made everything uncertain.Among the garments exported from Calcutta to Bangladesh are saris, kurtas and pyjamas, salwar suits, three-piece lehngas, shirts and trousers, skull caps, dhotis, lungis and children’s garments. Unstitched fabric, too, is exported to Bangladesh.Importers there sell the items to wholesalers, who then supply them to retail markets across the country.“This year, exporters from Bengal were getting bigger orders because of the lockdown in China, where the coronavirus outbreak there. But just when export from India started picking up around the last week of March, the country went on a 21-day lockdown,” said P.C. Maity, the chairman of the clearing agents association at Calcutta airport.He said several exporters who had sent consignments were waiting for payments from Bangladesh. An exporter who did not want to be named said the demand of garments from Bangladesh was usually so high that several of his colleagues would come together and book cargo flights.“This time, too, we had booked cargo flights for at least four days. All had to be cancelled. Although we could have exported garments, there were no drivers and workers available to take the consignments from warehouses to the airport,” he said.Another exporter said consignments were stuck on the road.The exporters procure the garments from local manufacturers and also from other states, including Gujarat and Maharashtra. “I fear this year there would be almost no business. In Bangladesh the lockdown is till April 11, but we don’t know if it would be extended,” said Md Salauddin of Dhaka who imports about 200 tonnes of garments during Id. Md Paltu, another importer from Dhaka, said traders would usually import 80 per cent of garments between the end of March and the start of May. “Even after the lockdown is lifted, it would take time for the business to become normal,” he said.",2020-05-04 20:44:00
484,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: New normal awaits OPD patients in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Clinics and outpatient departments in hospitals will have a new normal once they resume functioning, to avoid Covid-19 infections.Patients might benefit from the new system as many doctors will be forced to improve their time management and not let the number of patients swell, resulting in shorter waiting time, officials of hospitals and clinics said.In the new normal, patients’ appointments will be taken by phone and each patient given a particular slot. They will be asked to strictly follow the timings, while doctors, too, will have to tweak their plans to ensure patients are examined on time, said officials. The number of patients at a clinic or hospital OPD will go down significantly to ensure social distancing.  At many clinics and OPDs, where hundreds of people visit every day, patients often have to wait for hours before they get a chance to meet the doctor, leading to crowding. In the new system, each patient will be given a time slot and the doctors will be told about the timings. Many clinics said they would cancel appointments if patients turn up late. A number of doctors said they would refer any patient with fever to a fever clinic at any hospital, where physicians wearing personal protective equipment will examine him or her.Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, which has a separate OPD unit on its EM Bypass campus and runs several other clinics across the city, has told its doctors, including surgeons, to improve time management, an official at the hospital said.“Surgeons and other doctors doing procedures often get delayed because they get caught in operating theatres. That is one reason for delays at OPDs and clinics. We are planning to ask doctors to schedule surgeries and consultations on different days to ensure there is no delay in OPDs,” said an official of the hospital. The OPDs in most hospitals have started opening up and so are some clinics. But the number of doctors and patients is very low, compared with the usual pre-lockdown turnout.On Tuesday, the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, a non-statutory body comprising several private hospitals in Calcutta, held a meeting to discuss how to restore normality. Association sources said one important factor was managing OPDs and clinics.“It is now easier to manage given the low patient footfall, but once the numbers start rising, we have to come up with new norms,” said an official of a private hospital, which is a member of the association.“Walk-in appointments, which used to be very common, would not be allowed by most hospitals and clinics except for emergency cases,” he said.“We’ll have to improve our timings, otherwise there will be crowding. Also, there will be fewer follow-up consultations because that could be done online,” said physician Amitabha Saha.Owners of standalone medicine stores across neighbourhoods of Calcutta, which have small clinics for doctors, are also tweaking their system. The owner of one shop said he was asking patients to turn up only a few minutes before the scheduled time.",2020-05-05 23:03:00

Locking us inside seems to have given them a chance to step out and explore their surroundings without the fear of being disturbed.Early mornings, when I sit still on a bench in the cosy park looking at some unkempt shrubs, a Common Prinia with gray-brown plumage flits in and out. The Purple-rumped Sunbird gives it company in search of nectar from wild flowers.A Green Pigeon nibbles on a banyan fig while a pair of Red-vented Bulbul pecks on ripe fruits of the mohua tree in a corner. As I look at them with rapt attention, a dazzling golden bird takes flight. It is the Black-hooded Oriole known by its Bangla name, Isti-kutum, the announcer of arriving guests. But of course, I know, we will not have any guests now, not for the time being.Reverberating Cuckoo calls only remind of the arrival of spring.But this spring is different.

Be it the mechanical beating sound of the Basanta-bouri (Coppersmith Barbet) or the shrill cry of a Black Kite couple while building a nest in a mobile tower, I have never felt nature so alive before.On a lazy afternoon on my day off, I saw a Bee Eater on the barbed fencing cautiously waiting for solitary bees out of hives. I heard the Ghughu (Dove) cooing softly in courtship and saw a horde of Parakeets make a sweeping move along the skyline before perching themselves on the giant Rudrapalash in the park.At dusk, the Fingeys (Drongos) with their black plumage and dark ghost-like silhouette, do aerial manoeuvres to catch insects under street lights.As evening descends, the big banyan tree beside Regent Park post office comes alive. It sounds like all the birds in the city have decided to sing their hearts out.As I return from duty at night, almost every day I find the Banglar Pencha (Bengal Eagle Owl) sitting on the traffic kiosk at the deserted four-point crossing of Ranikuthi…. It nods its head as if to say, ‘you take rest, I take it from here’.",2020-05-05 23:03:00
486,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Traffic surge prompts stricter check in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Police have been asked to be more stringent in checking vehicles from Wednesday as Tuesday witnessed a surge in traffic across some of the city’s thoroughfares.The city’s traffic witnessed a nearly 20 per cent surge on Tuesday compared to other days during the lockdown, revealed an assessment of the traffic situation carried out by officers at Lalbazar during the day. BT Road, the EM Bypass, Diamond Harbour Road and JL Nehru Road were among the busiest on Tuesday.Traffic movement peaked between 9.30am and 11.30am on Tuesday, the police said. Many of the vehicles out on the road were self-driven cars. Senior officers at Lalbazar overseeing traffic movement held a meeting with their counterparts across all the traffic guards late on Tuesday afternoon and laid down guidelines for stringent checking of vehicles.The police have been asked to find out more strictly if someone is out on work or without any specific purpose. “Anyone out on the road in a vehicle will have to clearly explain why he or she is out,” a senior police officer said. “They must be able to produce an identity card and some document from the office showing he is office-bound. They must also be able to show a vehicular exemption pass.”Vehicle exemption passes are available on: https://coronapass.kolkatapolice.org, the police said. One has to fill in an application form online and download the pass. The pass will be valid for the prescribed route and for the period.Officers out on the road have also been asked to ensure there is no unnecessary movement of vehicles after the office timings of 10am and 6pm.Anyone from any of the 516 containment zones found out on the road will be prosecuted. Nine such vehicles were prosecuted on Tuesday after the owner or the driver failed to justify why he was out on the road. “All vehicles will be strictly checked for proper documents. Going to office can’t be an excuse,” a police officer said. “All officers and constables have been advised to wear gloves, face covers and masks on duty to minimise chances of infection.”Several checking points have been set up along some of the thoroughfares. Five checkpoints have been set up on the EM Bypass, between the Parama and Phoolbagan crossings alone. Checkpoints have also been set up at Sinthee and on Dum Dum Road for vehicles coming from the north. A few companies with offices in Salt Lake and Sector V have spoken to some transport department officials, asking if arrangements can be made to ferry their staff. Officials are yet to decide on the matter.“The government directive speaks about movement only within green zones, not in any other zone,” said a transport department official.",2020-05-05 23:03:00
488,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Covid-19 data norms for private hospitals  - Telegraph India,"The state health department on Tuesday gave private hospitals a revised format to report Covid-19 cases and asked them to give a 24-hour update every morning, along with a list of patients and their comorbidities.Private hospitals will have to give the update at 10am daily with the number of new patients admitted/discharged/referred to other hospitals/deaths in the past 24 hours. The format also has a column on the number of Covid-19 patients still admitted and another to list comorbidities of patients.A private hospital official told Metro that he had spoken to health department officials after receiving the revised format on Tuesday. “Earlier, a hospital used to send data in the morning. Another set of data was sent in the evening if more patients were added. This was creating confusion and duplication,” the official said.“Suppose our hospital had 10 patients when the morning data was sent. If two more patients were admitted by evening, a fresh round of data was sent in the evening, saying we had 12 patients,” he said. “Now, they want all hospitals to update their data till 10am and send a list by 10.30am.”The revised format asks for comorbidities of a patient. A doctor said comorbidity meant more than one illness in a person and that the other illnesses made the person more vulnerable to Covid-19.A five-member committee of doctors, which was auditing Covid-19 deaths in the state, has said many of the deaths were because of comorbidities.On Thursday, Sinha said the committee would no longer assess all Covid-19 deaths. The committee has given broad recommendations that doctors and hospitals should follow, he said.The distribution of the new format comes a day after chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said a complicated reporting structure was creating problems. Private hospitals are not as forthcoming with data as government hospitals, he had said on Monday.The state government had not announced patient figures between Friday and Sunday following a difference in the number of Covid-19 cases in the state given by Sinha and health secretary Vivek Kumar on Thursday.In a letter to Union health secretary Preeti Sudan, Kumar had listed 931 Covid-19 positive cases on Thursday. On the same day, Sinha had said the state had 572 active Covid-19 cases; 139 patients cured; 105 dead, including 33 directly from the virus.",2020-05-05 23:04:00
489,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Hydroxychloroquine distribution allegation in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is distributing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) without prescription to those living in slums from where Covid-19 cases have been reported or shanties next to them, civic officials have alleged.The distribution is not limited to household contacts of positive cases, which is the guideline issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state health department, the officials said. One official said it was being distributed among all slum-dwellers who are not refusing. The ICMR guidelines specify that “the drug has to be given only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner” and that “asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19” and “asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases” are eligible to take it.High doses of hydroxychloroquine can cause irregular heartbeat. Mayor Firhad Hakim told Metro that health workers conducting surveillance in the slums were asking potential patients to visit the corporation’s health clinics. “A doctor is examining them and prescribing the medicine if needed,” Hakim said. Several CMC officials on the ground, however, said the medicine was being distributed through health workers. Rabin Chakraborty, interventional cardiologist, said if taken by someone with pre-existing heart diseases, hydroxychloroquine can have serious consequences. He suggested the corporation ask if the person has any  pre-existing heart disease, if someone in the family suffered a sudden death or if the person takes any medicine that weakens the heart. “A doctor should see the answers and advise who can be given the medicine,” he said.",2020-05-05 23:06:00
490,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: Day 2: Booze queues grow longer in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The queues outside liquor stores got longer on Tuesday as people travelled from faraway places and stood for hours to buy liquor.In Salt Lake, people from Dakshineswar, Baranagar and Burrabazar had queued up outside a liquor store.A young man who lives near Peerless Hospital travelled to Garia after he found the liquor store closest to his place shut, only to find a 2km-long queue of stones, bags and handkerchiefs kept in marked circles — almost an hour before the store was to open. He returned empty-handed.Police officers on the city’s southern outskirts said several people who have been collecting relief material from cops during the lockdown were spotted standing in the liquor line in Sonarpur area.On Monday, thousands of people had stepped out of their homes to queue up outside liquor stores. Cops were seen managing crowds, drawing circles for people to stand in them and even standing in queues at some places to end the line so that shops could be closed on time.On Tuesday, the police tried to scan through the crowd to eliminate “outsiders”.In Salt Lake, cops started asking for identity documents from those in the queue near City Centre and allowed only the township residents.“We found many people from the sealed areas of Shyambazar, Burrabazar, Teghoria and Kaikhali queuing up in front of liquor stores,” an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.Some had reached from Baranagar and Dakshineswar, he said.On Rashbehari Avenue, the police deployment was less than Monday’s. An officer said it was not possible to engage half the police station on “liquor duty” every day. “Teething troubles are normal on the first day. Things will gradually fall in place just like the lines outside grocery shops,” the officer said.In the New Market area, the first 100 people in a queue were given tokens around 5.45pm. The rest were asked to return home. This was done to avoid rush or crowding when the shop would close, the police said.The police have been asked to ensure that distancing rules are followed outside liquor stores, state home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Tuesday. “We have spoken to the police and will talk again. Lockdown norms have to be followed. Just like a system was prepared for shops of essential supplies, we will talk to the state and city police to make similar arrangements.”Additional reporting by Debraj Mitra",2020-05-05 23:06:00
491,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus outbreak: Hospital in Calcutta stops admission - Telegraph India," A portion of the Institute of Child Health at Park Circus was shut down on Tuesday and admission temporarily closed in another portion of the hospital after over 10 nurses tested positive for Covid-19, an official of the hospital said.The newborn intensive care unit (NICU) of the hospital was shut down after more than 10 nurses who worked there tested positive, the official said. They were contacts of another nurse who had tested positive on Friday. The hospital has 200 beds, including the 40-bed NICU. The NICU has about 30 nurses, said officials. “After the nurse tested positive on Friday, some other nurses who came in contact with her were quarantined. Most of these nurses have tested positive,” said the official.The hospital authorities are trying to shift the lone child admitted to the NICU of the hospital before it shut down to another hospital, the official said. The official said the hospital has been facing acute nurse shortage since the lockdown was implemented as many of the nurses have not been able to report to work.“With so many nurses testing positive, it becomes difficult now to run the NICU,” he said. The main wing of the hospital had 35 children admitted on Tuesday evening. No new admission is being allowed  now. “We are not shifting children from the main building as it is unaffected. But we have kept new admissions on hold for now. We will meet and decide whether we have enough manpower to take new admissions in the main building,” the official said. The 35 children will be discharged as and when they are cured, said the official. Several hospitals in the city have had to shut down or close operations partially after their doctors or nurses tested positive for Covid-19. Peerless Hospital on Monday decided to suspend admissions and keep the emergency ward and the outpatient department closed for an indefinite period as some doctors and nurses had tested positive for Covid-19 last week and several others had to be quarantined. Officials of the hospital said 150 patients admitted there, including 20 Covid-19 cases, would be treated till they are discharged.Lab finedA diagnostic laboratory at Kankurgachhi, Tribeni Clinics, has been fined Rs 10 lakh for conducting swab tests for Covid-19 without the approval of the Indian Council of Medical Research. The state health department, which issued the fine order, said they had also lodged a complaint against the laboratory with Phoolbagan police station.",2020-05-05 23:06:00
492,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: ‘Warm’ homecoming from Ajmer for pilgrims and migrant workers - Telegraph India,"Around 1,200 people from Bengal who were stranded in Ajmer for nearly a month since the nationwide lockdown had started on March 25 reached Dankuni in Hooghly on Tuesday morning on a special train.Most of them were pilgrims. Around 150 were migrant workers who were employed in the Rajasthan town. The train reached Dankuni station, in Hooghly district, at 10.45am, nearly 24 hours after it had left Ajmer. The passengers were accommodated in 24 non-AC sleeper coaches and there was only one operational stop during the journey, railway officials said.As the train chugged in, a team of senior state government officials stood to receive the passengers amid showers of petals. As soon as they stepped out of the station, each was handed a packet containing snacks and a bottle of water by transport department officials. Then they were told to head towards a health camp. On the way, their body temperature was checked with a thermal scanner.At the medical camps, doctors screened the passengers for Covid-19 symptoms. They were asked whether they had any symptom of the disease such as fever, cough or breathlessness. Health department officials noted down the phone number of each passenger and doctors offered them medicines. “The passengers were given hydroxychloroquine tablets,” said Hooghly district magistrate Y. Ratnakar Rao. “Those who did not have any symptom of Covid-19 were handed over a certificate saying that the person was asymptomatic. He or she was then asked to be in home quarantine for 14 days.” Over 60 state buses were kept ready to take the passengers home to Malda, Murshidabad, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24-Parganas and also Calcutta. They were asked to maintain physical distancing on the buses. “The bus conductor wouldn't even allow us to talk among ourselves,” said Seikh Allauddin. 'The arrangement by the state government was very warm and everyone was made to feel comfortable,” said the resident of Gayeshpur in Nadia. Allauddin had gone to Ajmer Sharif with Samsher Ali Biswas and Abdul Biswas, both from his locality, on a pilgrimage on March 20. “It was very difficult there during the lockdown. We were not even allowed to step out for a cup of tea. It seemed we would have to stay at Ajmer for life,” Alauddin said. Health department officials said healthcare workers in the home districts of the passengers would keep tabs on their condition for the next 14 days. In Calcutta, the responsibility has been assigned to a team from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. “I can’t be thankful enough to the state government and to the chief minister for arranging for our return,” said Samir Ali from Topsia. The call centre executive had gone on a pilgrimage to Ajmer in early March. His father Akhtar Ali would call him up every day. Mother Sony Ali would do so at times. The parents were elated on Tuesday afternoon. Their son is finally back home.",2020-05-05 23:07:00
494,Brinda Sarkar,"Weighed down by chores, salt lake residents make do with home fixes or simply give up on their appearances - Telegraph India","The otherwise suave, stylish and clean-shaven Shayan Mitra Mustafi of CL Block has been so busy with chores during the lockdown he says his beard had got as long as Tagore’s! DB Block’s Sonali Basak has been washing dishes to the point that her manicured nails have chipped off. Sankalpa 2’s Sinjini Das Chakraborty’s hair grew so out of proportion that she asked her husband to chop it off.This is the new normal as far as personal grooming is concerned. The lockdown has kept salons shut till recently and without domestic helps, most residents have been too exhausted to look after their looks.“Such is the fatigue and frustration that people are heading straight from the kitchen to attend Zoom meetings on their laptop, sweating and with hair dishevelled. Even if some are donning a formal shirt they are too tired to change into trousers. They attend meetings in boxers!” says Swagata Paul, make-up artiste who lives in DC Block’s The Residency. Swagata has since made videos to help her clients dress up for Zoom meetings quickly. (see box inside)Hair-raising talesAura salon in BE Block has had to turn away a few customers since it opened last week but it has nothing to do with their body temperature. “Some people tried to cut their hair at home and made a mess. Now that we’ve opened, they’re coming for damage control, but it’s beyond help. We’re asking them to go home, grow their hair somewhat and then return for a decent cut,” says owner Pradip Das.Jolly Chanda of FE Block’s Satin Rose Salon and Spa says it’s a comedy show everyday now watching people walk in with haircuts they tried on themselves. “Some have used trimmers and attempted “fader” haircuts but these are very tough. The salon is full of such men now, asking us to fix their hair,” she says.Others took advantage of the lockdown. “I always wanted bangs but the parlours said it wouldn’t suit my hair. So I thought the lockdown would be the best time to get it. Even if it looked bad, my hair would grow back by the time the lockdown is lifted,” says Sinjini, whose husband went through YouTube videos, including those on bangs disasters, before snipping.Luckily for her, Sinjini is looking  so cute now that she’s appointed husband Sudip as her permanent stylist. “He cut our son’s hair too, while I cut his,” she says.Meghna Rathi of CK Block has always sported funky hairdos — fader cuts with lines. “I was getting irritated as my hair grew long but luckily, my stylist had some work in Salt Lake and was cycling here one day. I called him over and asked him to chop my entire family’s hair,” she smiles happily.Then there are those like John Sengupta, who have bought hairbands and are trying out new looks every day. “Side parting, middle parting, back brush, man bun…the lockdown is a time to reinvent yourself and I’m encouraging others to try the same,” he says. No prizes for guessing that he’s a fashion designer. John teaches at iNIFD Saltlake near City Centre.Basak, whose DB Block ground floor is rented out to Styles & Smiles salon, had been counting the days till it opened. “It opened on Monday and I was their first customer,” says the lady who got her hair coloured and eyebrows done.Jolly of Satin Rose says many people tried to colour their hair at home and messed it up big time. “Customers don’t know that the colours have to be mixed before using. Many are coming to us now with different shades along the length of their hair and on the roots,” she shakes her head.Bapi Store, a speciality cosmetics outlet near Kwality More, says the sale of cosmetics has gone down to five per cent of total sales. “Previously lipsticks and nail paint were top sellers but now people have no occasion to deck up,” says owner Kartik Kumar Patra. “I’m bullish on sanitisers now.”Needs, another cosmetic store at Baisakhi, says the sale of lipsticks, nail polish and hair colour has picked up since the “Unlock 1.0” plan was announced. “Before that, we sold lots of hair bands, including metallic ones for men, hair and beard trimmers, eyebrow trimmers...” says owner Nitai Debnath.Hands that toilSome women tried to wax their legs and thread their eyebrows with painful results. “Some bought waxing kits but failed to pull the strip off off the skin properly. They are now coming to us with rashes,” says Jolly. “Many swept the floor barefoot and have developed corns; many washed clothes and utensils with harsh detergents and their hands have got coarse. They are all coming now for pedicures and manicures. After weeks of slogging, they want to be pampered.”On public demand, Swagata released a video to teach women a simple method to do their own eyebrows during the lockdown.Sayan, who is a bridal wear designer, likes his clean-shaven look but chores took such a toll that he had no time to shave. “Before I knew it, the beard was weeks old.”“I looked like Rabindranath!” he says. “It’s best to get such a long beard shaved off by a professional but it’s not safe visiting parlours now. Since I had some client visits last week I had to shave it off myself, at the cost of some nicks and cuts. Now that we are returning to public life, I’ve started oiling and conditioning my hair again too.”Skin and hair care routines like facials and hair spas have gone for a toss but those like Trina Kar Dutta are doing the best they can at home. “I’m making face packs out of leftovers — banana, papaya, curd... If done well, these can work better than facials. I’ve been applying moisturiser on my hands after doing the dishes and using loofah to exfoliate skin,” says the CF Block resident.Dress code“Unless you’re Katrina Kaif posting a video of yourself washing vessels, you wear regular clothes during lockdown,” Sayan puts it quite simply.Others agree. “I’m wearing regular clothes even to the market as they’ll be dipped in antiseptic the moment I get back,” says Trina, who had been nominated for a Facebook “sari challenge” in the early days of the lockdown. “It asked me to post a picture of myself in a sari but frankly, back then I had no energy to play along. When I got used to the lockdown after a few weeks I started donning new or nice clothes from my wardrobe for an hour and posting pictures. It made me feel positive.”Propa Chakravartty has no occasion to don fancy clothes anymore. “My mother’s birthday was during the lockdown, my mother-law’s birthday is approaching but we can’t go over so there’s no excitement to dress up. My clothes are gathering dust in the closet,” says the BL Block resident.Sinjini had gone to visit her in-laws in Barasat when the lockdown started. They are stuck there ever since. “We had brought four or five sets of clothes with us which we are wearing day in day out. On Jamai Sashthi, we saw a clothes shop open nearby and picked up something for ourselves. We wore them and showed my parents over video call,” she says. “So much for celebration.”Sayan, who has resumed meeting clients, is donning the best of his formals but his issue is different. “I don’t have an iron at home and it’s not safe to send clothes to the laundry at this time so I’m unable to bring these clothes back into the wardrobe,” he says.But John has been wearing red, orange, green and similar “happy-coloured” outfits while holding online classes. “I’ve asked the students to dress sharply too. One has to look good all the time and the lockdown is no exception,” says the designer who has rearranged the lighting at home so his face looks brighter on video calls.Digital partiesJohn has in fact been holding “digital parties” with his friends where all meet and greet, dressed to the nines. “Many have also been seeking advice on dressing up for Zoom meetings so I ask them to send me snaps of a few tops, skirts, scarves, hair bands, jewellery so I can mix and match it for them,” he says.Swagata has also been swamped with requests to help people with make-up that will be visible and appropriate for video calls. “With free time at hand people are going all out making TikTok videos and the like. For these they have to look their best,” she says. “As for corporate meetings over video call, at least comb your hair, apply eye liner, a light lipstick and change into a top that isn’t faded. Before the meeting look at yourself in the mirror and make sure you feel good about what you see.”Do you face similar problems now? Write to saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-05-06 09:04:00
495,Sudeshna Banerjee,Health scan prior to domestic help return in New Town - Telegraph India,"As debate still rages about the right way to allow re-entry of domestic help into homes with the easing of lockdown, some highrise complexes have introduced medical screening to inspire confidence among residents.The first complex to hold a health camp for their domestic help and facility management staff was Greenwood Sonata. The camp was held over two days — May 24 and 26. “We spread the camp out over two days to ensure social distancing. They were given a general briefing on Covid-19 and were asked to contact us for any symptoms in them or in the houses they work in. It gave them confidence to interact with us,” said Sudipta Mukherjee, president of Greenwood Sonata Apartment Owners’ Association. A total of 156 people got themselves tested, including 31 facility management staff.The association created a profile of each individual and the data was shared with their employer. “It has their address which would help us monitor whether their locality is becoming a containment zone, their contact number and medical history. They were asked whether they had developed any influenza-like symptoms in the last few months. Those who reported having diabetes or thyroid problems got their blood samples collected for tests.” The tab for the check-up was picked up by the individual employers in case of the domestic help and by the association for the facility staff.The association has offered to take care of the follow-up treatment too in this period. “Only the cost of medicines will have to be borne by the person or his or her employer,” Mukherjee added.  Greenwood Sonata is also considering building a medicine bank for common ailments to help the staff on a case-to-case basis. “They should feel there is an umbrella over their head.”At DLF New Town Heights, a nine-hour health camp took place on Sunday. “We got the idea from Greenwood Sonata,” said Sameer Sharma, secretary of New Town Heights Apartment Owners’ Association. “Our residents were very happy to get this chance to ensure well-being of their staff,” he added.“They said 46 would come, but 99 turned up,” smiled Bibekananda Panda, a general physician whose diagnostic centre organised both the camps in association with a residents’ body called New Town Forum & News. “Since I was not expecting a high turn-out, I did not take a second doctor along to assist me. Along with my laboratory technicians, I was up to my neck with the workload,” he added.But the number is not that high in a complex with 450 apartments occupied. “The other families are still not convinced about entry of domestic help. We are allowing three days’ entry in houses of working couples and five days a week for senior citizens’ houses,” said Sharma. At Greenwood Sonata, a detailed standard operating procedure has been handed to each apartment owner and tenant. Till June 15, part-time maid service has been allowed on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while full-time caregivers for senior citizens are allowed from Monday to Friday.The camps were welcomed by the domestic help. “Many could not get access to health check-up amid the lockdown. At Greenwood Sonata, a woman had cough and cold. I asked her to stay home and report to me daily over phone about her well-being. Thankfully she recovered in a week. At DLF, too, a house-keeping staffer has been asked to stay home for 10 days,” said Panda.A Covid-19 awareness session was held in Sankalpa 3 on May 24. “Our housekeeping, security and gardening staff are the backbone of our complex. We wanted to make them understand about the disease — how to protect themselves, how to dispose medical waste in the eventuality of a resident testing positive and isolating at home… This way they would feel  confident about continuing work,” said Amitava Chakraborty, a general surgeon and a resident, who conducted the session.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-05-06 09:23:00
496,Snehal Sengupta,coronavirus: Fire and emergency services minister Sujit Bose hospitalised after week’s home stay - Telegraph India,"Fire and emergency services minister Sujit Bose, who is also the MLA from Bidhannagar and had tested positive for Covid-19 on May 28, was admitted to a hospital off EM Bypass on Wednesday.According to one of his close aides, Bose had complained of fever and breathlessness before getting admitted.Bose was under home quarantine since last week after he tested positive for coronavirus along with his wife and domestic help.His son’s test result had come out negative initially but he tested positive after doctors advised him to undergo another swab test.“Dada was initially without symptoms but when he complained of fever and shortness of breath, we admitted him to the private hospital,” the aide said, referring to Bose.With the minister testing positive, more than 75 persons, including senior fire department officials, who came in contact with him were advised to stay in home quarantine.Bose had visited several areas in Salt Lake, Lake Town and Dakshindari with fire and emergency services teams to supervise the removal of fallen trees.Among the sites he visited in Salt Lake to oversee the removal of trees was Karunamoyee Housing Estate, CA Block and places along the EM Bypass near Duttabad.He had come in contact with at least two councillors including Rajesh Chirimar and Nirmal Dutta during these efforts. Dutta told The Telegraph Salt Lake that he underwent a test on Friday and his test results came negative. Chirimar said that he was “doing fine” and had not developed any symptoms.Ranjan Poddar, a Karunamoyee resident who had helped Bose organise the tree-removal efforts in the housing estate, said that he too had undergone the swab test. “My test report has come negative. It is a big relief,” said Poddar.Bose’s test report sent the residents of Baisakhi Abasan into a tizzy as his car is parked there for the past several days. “The car has not been sanitised. There is nobody around as well,” said Pradip Chakraborty, a resident.Bose’s aide said that Bose’s driver stayed in Baisakhi. He had driven the car home and parked it there. The driver too is under home quarantine and his Covid-19 test results are awaited, the aide said.Jaydev Naskar, another councillor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, had organised a yajna to pray for Bose’s speedy recovery. However, once the photographs of the event circulated in social media, there was criticism. According to party sources, Naskar has been rapped by the party leadership.Fresh casesAn elderly resident of Labony Estate tested positive for coronavirus and is admitted in Belle Vue nursing home. The apartment building was sanitised by the civic body on Wednesday.Another man in his seventies has tested positive for Covid-19 in AH Block.

A middle-aged man, who was a tenant in an apartment, fell ill after returning from hospital where he had gone for dialysis. He was admitted in Medical College and Hospital, where he expired the same day.“He used to go for dialysis regularly. On returning home this time, he developed diarrhoea and breathing trouble, and had to be taken back to hospital. His Covid-19 report came on May 24, two days after he passed away.

497,Sudeshna Banerjee,Replant fallen trees : Salt lake - Telegraph India,"Apropos the article “AJ Block man does fallen tree survey,” published on May 29, Salt Lake is known for its lush green arboreous cover holding itself atop the sun-scorched stretches of road like a gazebo during summer. Avenues and lanes of this township are adorned by stalwarts like radhachura, krishnachura and neem that play host to a variety of birds, squirrels and other species.Perhaps there is no resident who hasn’t nurtured in their backyards mango, coconut and palm or even vegetable trees. While nature’s fury on a fateful May 20 has razed down a significant number of these green sentinels, not all is lost.The municipality staff might take a leaf out of the pages of New Town’s Rosedale Garden, which has perhaps scripted history by replanting the fallen trees in their complex. It would have been an even more splendid sight if authorities and residents joined hands in helping our all-weather friends stand on their feet instead of than hewing them down and stowing them away to a dumping site.Sharmistha Dhar,AC BlockEntry dilemmaApropos the article “To call or not call for help,” published on May 8, the question is ‘how long’. Can anyone say how long it would take for the situation to normalise? One month? Two? Three? No one knows.We have to live with this virus and at the same time open up most sectors gradually with sufficient care and restriction. Otherwise particularly the domestic helps, cleaner and less-privileged class will start facing acute financial crisis. As it is, many households refused to pay the wages of these workers for the month of April.Since most of the housing complexes are allowing office staff to commute and AC, fridge and water filter repairing technicians to come then why not helps?Senior citizens and ailing residents are facing acute challenges without such support staff. Do you think we can stop Covid-19 by shutting the gate of our complex? Do you have control over who your neighbour is exposed to when he goes out of the gates? The answer is no.So lets be pragmatic. Follow basic hygiene like using masks, gloves and sanitiser, do screening by checking body temperature if you can but leave it to the residents to allow or stop domestic helps. Sooner or later we all have to do that.Arnab Bhowmik,Greenwood Elements, New TownBeing part of a gated society residential complex, we have been receiving requests to allow domestic helps, but majority of residents are not in favour.Yes, they are having to make adjustments but they believe in safety first. They are not comfortable with anyone walking through their gates coming from vulnerable zones. The presence of asymptomatic cases makes it an all-the-more challenging situation.We are waiting for further government circulars and shall continue to restrict anyone coming from “red zones”, whatever the pressure might be.Yes, we are allowing repair technicians in but there is a difference between a domestic help coming from a containment zone and a TV mechanic coming for a job that will not expose them to elderly, vulnerable residents. If the government and health departments think we forego all concerns and normalise, lets do that. but that’s an endless debate.My personal opinion is that the government has ensured lockdown and zones with a plan to break the chain. We citizens we should ensure its success and I would even ask helps to think twice before they enter different houses.Dhrubajyoti Basak,President, Greenwood ElementsNew year bluesApropos the article “Bengali new year greeted on screen,” published on April 17, each and every Bengali waits for Poila Baisakh every year. But this year, I didn’t celebrate.The reason was sombre. During this ongoing lockdown, media houses are constantly reporting about the agony of our fellow Indians. Despite the authorities trying their best, lakhs of people are struggling to get enough food for themselves and their family members. In such a situation, I could not get myself to celebrate.I would also like to comment on the April 10 article titled “Lockdown heroes.” In these trying times, the real heroes and heroines are those who are feeding stray animals.Many of these animals depend on leftovers given by roadside eateries. Since these are shut now, the animals would go hungry if it wasn’t for the state forest department employees, police personnel and common people who are going out of their way to feed them.Sourish Misra,SA BlockFlouting lockdownIt is very sad that many people did not take the lockdown seriously. Once during the early days of the lockdown I spotted a man hiding behind a car in front of my house. He was peeping from behind the car and looking ahead, just like one would in the game of hide-and-seek. He had spotted a police patrol car!Every afternoon at about 3pm, I would find a couple of domestic helps loitering on the road of DL Block.On the day of janta curfew, we clapped to applaud police, doctors, nurses and everyone risking their health to support us. What was the use of a one-day show of appreciation, if we cannot do our little bit to support them by simply staying home?Smita Deb,Address not given",2020-05-06 11:05:00
498,Brinda Sarkar,Loudspeakers reach doctor words home - Telegraph India,"A Covid-19 awareness camp was held on Sunday with doctors addressing residents of AB and AC Blocks. However, with “stay home” orders enforced, loudspeakers were installed around so all could hear the doctors without having to visit the community hall.Days after cyclone Amphan claimed around 3,000 trees around the township, councillor Anindya Chatterjee has started a plantation drive in his ward.“Two hundred and fifty trees have fallen in Ward 41 so we shall plant 300 to replace them,” said Chatterjee at the launch of the drive on May 31. “We are calling the project Rebuild Bidhannagar and will be consulting experts before planting the saplings. The trees will be planted such that their roots don’t get entangled with sewerage lines and their branches are not affected by overhead cables.”The drive was kicked off from AC Block community hall by deputy mayor Tapas Chatterjee, who planted a guava sapling next to the hall. The committee will be planting more fruit trees such as mango, jackfruit and litchi in the coming weeks. “Many other dignitaries were slated to come, including minister and MLA Sujit Bose but since he has been diagnosed with Covid-19, we kept it low key,” said Chatterjee.The ongoing lockdown has led to a crisis of blood and the ward hosted a blood donation camp on the same day, organised by the blood bank of Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital. Keeping Covid-19 protocol in mind, the bank had capped the number of donors at 40.“I’m a health worker in this ward and wanted to help those in need of fresh blood,” said Bhaskar Biswas, walking out of the hall. “People are scared to come to such camps now but since I’ve been working for Covid and Amphan relief, I was eager to help out here too.”Through the ward, the Rotary Club of Calcutta Laban Hrad donated 50 PPEs to the sub-divisional hospital. Chatterjee, who is president of the club, facilitated the handover. “The club received donation of Rs 20,000 from Karunamoyee resident Sanjay Ghosh, who commemorated his parents’ 57th anniversary thus,” he said.  Residents and institutes in the ward have also donated to the state emergency relief fund. “Together for Covid and Amphan, we raised about Rs 1,40,000. Even Labanhrad Vidyapith (AD School) and BD Market traders’ association contributed. Today we shall be handing over the cheques to the authorities,” said Chatterjee.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-05-06 11:05:00

500,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Drive to replace felled trees with thinner ones begins - Telegraph India,"Three trees that were uprooted by Cyclone Amphan at Bhowanipore’s Harish Park were replaced on Friday by five 10-year-old trees that were residents of a nursery for tall trees in New Town till the day before.Storms have been uprooting old, shallow-rooted and disproportionately balanced trees in Calcutta for many years but this was the first time they were replaced by trees that have grown some foliage. Earlier, saplings and seedlings would be planted on special occasions.Saplings take years to grow and often do not survive, while a grown-up tree has a better chance of survival. Also, the 10-year-old trees planted in Harish Park are more likely to develop a good volume of foliage by winter, so that their leaves are in a position to absorb fine particles and reduce air pollution.It would have taken years for saplings to compensate for the loss of large trees.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee laid some earth at the base of a replanted neem tree at Harish Park to launch the programme. Amphan, which struck Calcutta on May 20, felled about 16,000 trees in Calcutta and its neighbouring areas, Mamata said.If the experiment of planting grown-up trees in place of uprooted ones succeed, Calcutta could get back some of the trees it lost quicker.After launching the programme on Friday, Mamata also announced a change in the plantation policy of Calcutta. “We have to plant trees that are not uprooted during storms. We are going to plant neem trees. Many neem trees stood their ground during the cyclone,” the chief minister said.She added: “Ten thousand trees will be planted in Calcutta to compensate for the loss of the trees that were uprooted. Do not plant fat trees because they are uprooted in large numbers. Plant thin trees that do not get toppled easily.”A naturalist said planting neem trees was good but the authorities should also keep in mind that planting too many of a single species may not be a good idea.“Neem trees are hardwood trees and they are less vulnerable to storms. Hardwood trees take more time to grow and they have more strength than softwood trees. Hence, they can withstand wind pressure more,” the naturalist said.The five trees that were planted at Harish Park on Friday were of various species — ashok, bokul, neem, bilati gaab and bish. The trees were about 10ft tall.Naturalists and green activists said the idea of planting grown-up trees had several advantages. Arjan Basu Roy, the founder of NGO Nature Mates, said that given the loss of green suffered during Cyclone Amphan, Calcutta could not afford to plant only saplings and wait for a decade for them to grow good foliage.“A sapling grows into a tree in a decade or even more, whereas a tree that is 10 years old would be able to grow a good volume of foliage in a year,” he said.The trees that were planted at Harish Park on Friday may give the impression that a 10-year-old tree hardly has any foliage because they were trimmed before transportation. A forest department official said trimming was necessary so that the tree did not produce much resistance to wind and its vascular system was not strained.Travelling 15-20km through city roads could have damaged the trees if they were not trimmed considerably, said the official. “Visit the same place two months later and you will be surprised to see the foliage,” said the forest department official.The official said a sapling could get drowned by tall weeds around it. A sapling can also be destroyed by cattle and be subject to human vandalism. A 10-year-old tree can withstand these challenges.While the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is the custodian of Harish Park, the state forest department supplied the trees that were planted on Friday and would also nurture the trees for some time. The CMC has also planted five three-year-old trees along Harish Mukherjee Road where multiple giant trees were uprooted during the cyclone.CMC officials said the forest department had told the civic body that there were thousands of trees — aged between three and 10 — in their nurseries and these can be supplied for plantation along Calcutta’s roads.",2020-05-06 21:25:00
501,Pranesh Sarkar,Coronavirus pandemic: Scan on deaths in private Covid-19 hospitals of Bengal - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government will audit the reasons for the “large number of Covid-19 deaths” in private hospitals and nursing homes requisitioned by the state government to treat coronavirus patients.A team of experts will be set up to conduct the audit, said officials.So far, the state government has requisitioned 53 private hospitals and nursing homes across the state and converted them into dedicated Covid-19 treatment centres. These are in addition to the 16 dedicated government-run Covid-19 hospitals.“So far, 294 Covid-19 deaths have occurred in the state, in addition to 72 co-morbidity deaths. Of late, the majority of the deaths are being reported from private healthcare establishments that have been requisitioned by the government.  We need to find out the reasons why more patients are dying in these establishments,” a senior state government official said.Sources said the health department would set up a team of experts, which would visit the private establishments and conduct an audit to find out what the hospitals were lacking.“Initially, more deaths were being reported from government hospitals such as MR Bangur. But after a treatment protocol was fixed and a team of young doctors sent to the hospital, the situation has changed dramatically. We need to find out whether some of the private hospitals that have been requistioned are facing any problem,” a source said.Sources said the state government was concerned about the number of deaths in the private hospitals. “Over the past 14 days or so, it has been found that nearly 75 per cent of the deaths occurred at private hospitals,” said a source.Senior officials said the government could fix a treatment protocol for the requistioned private hospitals, too, since it had administrative control over them.“We can send some senior doctors to some of these hospitals. It is suspected that patients with severe symptoms are not being treated properly at these hospitals,” said an official.Some of the private hospitals — “including Sanjivan and ILS hospitals in Howrah” — were doing well. “It has to be ensured that all the hospitals provide similar quality treatment to the patients,” the official said.The government had on April 3 formed a committee to audit the reasons for the death of people testing positive for Covid-19. An inter-ministerial team from the Centre, which had visited the state in April, had questioned the panel’s purpose. The government later said the panel would no longer examine all deaths.",2020-05-06 21:27:00
502,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus pandemic: Anxiety over Durga Puja marks Snan Yatra - Telegraph India,"Snan Yatra, or Devasana Purnima, is an important ritual observed a fortnight before Rath Yatra.In Puri, lakhs of devotees witness the ritual at the Lord Jagannath temple. In Calcutta, the occasion coincides with a puja that marks the beginning of the construction of Durga Puja pandals.Not this year.This Snan Yatra, held on Friday, saw Durga Puja committees discuss how they would organise the annual festival. The lockdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy have hit many corporate houses.Most of them have been forced to cut down spending, casting a cloud on their sponsorship of big-ticket pujas.“We used to organise a puja on our club ground on Snan Yatra every year,” said Kajal Sarkar, of Bosepukur Sitalamandir Puja Committee. “This year, we are not even sure when we would talk to our decorator. None of the puja committees is sure about their budget this year.”Committee members would usually would turn up on their club premises with marigold garlands and a priest would perform a small puja amid cheers on Snan Yatra.Families that organise Durga Puja at home would mark this day by dusting the old bamboo structure of the idols.This year, in contrast, puja committee members wondered on a WhatsApp group whether it would be too ambitious to visit the artisans in Kumartuli towards the end of August to book idols.Durga Puja this year starts on October 22.Several puja committee members are trying to sound out their sponsors and advertisers. Most said the response is far from encouraging.Calcutta celebrates around 4,500 community pujas, involving a budget of around Rs 3,000 crore, according to the Forum for Durgostav, an umbrella organisation of over 250 puja committees.Medium to big-ticket pujas usually attract corporate sponsorships ranging between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 35 lakh.“The slump is overwhelming and extends to all sectors. Who will want to pay for ads or banners and hoardings?” wondered Sandipan Banerjee, the convener of the Behala Notun Dal puja committee.“There is no missing the message — all of us will have to bring down our budgets by 50 per cent.”Several puja organisers said they were confident of pulling off a moderate show with two months of preparations. But the gloom must dispel and the state government must make necessary amends to allow visitors to pour out.“Durga Puja will be held. That’s for sure,” said Saswata Basu, of Hatibagan Sarbojonin Durgostav Committee.“But it will be devoid of the colours and the glitz. That’s for sure, too.”",2020-05-06 21:32:00
503,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 5 crore trees for Sunderbans: Mamata Banerjee - Telegraph India,"The state government will plant “five crore” trees in the Sunderbans to make up for the loss of mangroves because of Cyclone Amphan, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday.Mamata said 1,600sq km of the 4,200sq km of the forests were ravaged by the storm. The mangroves are the protectors of the Sunderbans and by extension, even Calcutta. They have saved people from many natural disasters.“A large section of the mangroves has been destroyed by the cyclone. Mangroves have saved the Sunderbans many times in the past, even during Aila (the cyclone that struck in May 2009). We will plant five crore mangrove trees in the Sunderbans,” the chief minister said.The state forest department will launch the programme on July 14. Ravi Kant Sinha, the principal chief conservator of forests, said trees would be transported from nurseries of the forest department in the Sunderbans area.“We have nurseries in Jharkhali and many other areas in the Sunderbans. One-year-old trees will be transported from these nurseries and planted along the coast,” said Sinha.The plantation could be done by physically going down to the interface areas between the sea and the land, where the mangroves grow, or by throwing seeds on the soil.Tuhin Ghosh, the director of Jadavpur University’s School of Oceanographic Studies, said in places that were difficult to access, boats are taken as close to the land as possible and seeds are thrown on the soil.Specialists working on the Sunderbans’ ecology wondered whether it was possible to plant five crore saplings in the Sunderbans. Ghosh expressed doubt whether the state forest department has as many seedlings of mangrove trees.Since the roots of mangrove trees are well spread, they need considerable space between each other, a naturalist pointed out.The university professor and the naturalist lauded the plan to go for a plantation drive. “Mangroves act as obstruction against fierce winds and save the Sunderbans from damage caused by violent storms. The dense foliage breaks the wind speed. Besides, the mangroves trap sediments when water recedes during low tide. The sediments help in land building. This is the reverse of land being washed away by the sea. The trapped sediments raise the level of land,” said Ghosh.He said the plan to plant mangrove saplings was laudable but the forest department must keep the salinity of a place in mind.Different regions within the Sunderbans are fit for different kinds of mangrove trees because salinity varies from one place to another.“A particular mangrove tree may survive in one place but not in another in the Sunderbans delta. This happens because a tree can adapt to a particular level of salinity and salinity can differ from one place to another,” Ghosh said.",2020-05-06 21:33:00
504,TT Bureau,"Rain coming, cave-in alert  - Telegraph India","Three persons were injured when a portion of the third-floor balcony of a house on College Street collapsed on Friday morning.The four-storey house, more than a century old,  stands near the intersection of College Street and MG Road, right opposite the Barnaparichay Market Complex.A Calcutta Municipal Corporation official said the civic body had pasted a “dangerous building” tag on the house a couple of years ago but residents and owners of shops in the building allegedly removed it.Calcutta has over 2,500 dilapidated houses, according to the CMC. The civic body had feared Cyclone Amphan would damage many of them but there was no large-scale cave-in. An architect cautioned that the rain, not winds, might have made many of these structures more vulnerable. More such cave-ins are feared during the monsoon.“A portion of the balcony (of the College Street building) caved in a little before 9am. Two men and a woman were injured and taken to hospital,” said an officer of Amherst Street police station.The injured were two plumbers and a woman, who lived in the house. The plumbers were on the balcony during the cave-in.The plumbers — Raghu Mahapatra, 38, and Jaladhar Singh, 47 — were taken to the NRS Medical College and Hospital. The woman, Biva Gambhir, 50, was taken to a nursing home.Teams from the civic body and the fire department reached the spot after the cave-in. A firefighter said five persons were evacuated from the second and third floors.“Three of the evacuated persons were over 70,” said a firefighter. The residents of the house were taken to a temporary shelter, said sources in the civic body.The ground floor of the building houses sari shops and other business establishments. The upper floors have godowns and residential units.“The entire structure is dilapidated. It is sheer luck that only a 6ftX8ft portion of the balcony crashed,” said a civic engineer.“A couple of years ago, we had pasted a ‘dangerous building’ notice on the structure and asked the residents and traders to shift elsewhere. But the notice soon disappeared.”Man shotA man sitting outside his Shibpur home was shot by a motorcycle-borne person who fired one round and fled on Friday evening.

505,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Help from Texas for unwell teen - Telegraph India,"A Texan with roots in Calcutta has transferred Rs 35,000 to the bank account of a Calcuttan who was spotted waiting for a bus in Hazra, with two units of blood for his daughter, for 40 minutes on June 2.An equal amount is set to come soon.Sanchali Ganguly read about the plight of Biplab Banerjee in The Telegraph ( in a report headlined “Why they wait & how they are let down” on June 3), tracked him down, got his bank account number and transferred the amount within a day.Banerjee’s 15-year-old daughter is undergoing dialysis. Her father considers the help a godsend.The resident of Bonhooghly, near Dunlop, who earns a living working as a cook at a catering agency, has been without any income for two months because of the lockdown.Ganguly’s help would make a world of difference to his daughter’s treatment, he said.“Aamar meyeta hoyto ebar bechey jaabey (My daughter will probably survive now),” Banerjee said. “I have neither met this woman nor heard about her. But whatever she has done, I will always fall short of expressing my gratitude.”On Thursday, soon after the amount reached his account, Banerjee went out to buy costly antibiotics that his daughter’s doctor had prescribed to lessen her chest pain.A chest infection had come in the way of the teenager completing her dialysis on June 2. On Friday, she could undergo the full course of the procedure because of the antibiotics.This newspaper had reported about Banerjee’s plight while he was waiting to a catch a bus to reach Bagbazar, where his daughter was admitted to a nursing home for dialysis. He was holding a plastic bag containing two units of blood that his daughter would need.In Texas, it was 1.30am on June 3 when Ganguly was reading the report. Her daughter Avilasha, a medical student at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was busy with her studies.“I was devastated seeing his picture and knowing about how he was struggling to reach his daughter. I broke down and my daughter got worried,” Ganguly recounted.She reached out to Banerjee and by 8.30am on June 4 (IST), Biplab had given his bank account details to her. She said she wanted to transfer Rs 70,000 but rules related to transfer of American money came in the way.“I had that amount (Rs 35,000) in my Calcutta bank and so transferred it immediately. The rest would reach him in some time.”Banerjee said his daughter’s dialysis costs between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000.“Before every dialysis, she has to take an injection of haemoglobin that costs around Rs 1,200,” he said.Doctors have prescribed another round of antibiotics for his daughter. The patch in the chest has not yet cured. “A pack of 10 antibiotics costs Rs 936. So you can understand how difficult it is for me. I am trying. Let the best wishes from all of you be with her,” Banerjee said.",2020-05-06 21:37:00

Later, as the cyclone subsided, I found the thatched roof our house had blown away. The mud wall of our house collapsed,” said Mehbub, 20, whose father is a daily wage earner.“The teacher later managed to establish contact with him and learnt about the loss.”The teacher shared the story of his plight with his colleagues and scores of such tales from the Sunderbans led to the fund-raising drive.Partha Pratim Ray, a teacher of physics who is spearheading the drive, said they had drawn up a list of affected students based on inputs from teachers and student bodies.“So far, funds have been transferred to 120 students,” said Roy. The teacher Mehbub was in touch with separately gave him Rs 1,500.A good number of students at JU come from areas in and around the Sunderbans.Gayatri Mandal, a first-year student from Gosaba, said she would buy asbestos sheets to rebuild the roof of their house with the help she got on Monday.“Water was seeping into our rooms as the roof had blown off during the storm. I will buy asbestos. The teachers have assured us of more help,” said Gayatri, a first-year student of Sanskrit.A second-year student who stays with Gayatri in a hostel on the JU campus found out from her about the extent of damage and shared the details with teachers.Mehbub said he was filled with pride when his family received a sack containing 30kg rice and 25kg pulse from fellow students.A team of volunteers from the JU community kitchen visited Kultali days after Amphan to distribute essentials.Hindol Majumder, a member of the platform, said a teacher in the history department alerted them about the hardship the family is encountering and the volunteers distributed the stock.The volunteers could reach out to scores of students during their tour of the area, said Hindol, a research scholar.“JU has this culture of helping the helpless like us. I am proud of my fellow students and the teachers,” said Mehbub.Alleya Khatun of Kakdwip, who received financial help from teachers, said she would buy books because rainwater that had seeped into her room destroyed most of her books.JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said the initiative by the teachers and students showed how those in distress could be helped by forming a network. “This bonding between students and teachers at the time of crisis is setting an example,” said Das.",2020-05-06 21:55:00

The hospital would send the form to the health department and the CMC, seeking permission to hand over the body to the civic authorities for cremation.The health department would then give permission to the CMC and the hospital for cremation.“The whole thing was done through WhatsApp. It would take about two hours to get the clearance,” said an official of a private hospital. Now, it will take barely 30 minutes to complete the process.An official said omitting the health department’s role would ease the burden on Swasthya Bhavan and reduce delay in releasing bodies.Bank robbedThree masked and armed men entered a bank posing as customers and robbed Rs 17 lakh around 3.15pm on Friday.

509,Sanjay Mandal, Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Daughter of Sunderbans Man narrates ordeal - Telegraph India,"The daughter of a revered social and environment activist who had worked for decades for welfare of the Sunderbans’ residents recently visited several villages there to gain first-hand knowledge of the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan.Tania Das, younger daughter of Tushar Kanjilal, who had set up the Tagore Society for Rural Development in the Sunderbans in the late 1960s, said she visited 14 villages of the Hingalganj block of the mangrove delta in North 24-Parganas.Tania said she was unable to contact the people of these villages after Cyclone Amphan had struck on May 20. On May 22, she got a call from a person at Dulduli village in Hingalganj, on the banks of the Kalindi river, who told her that the cyclone had damaged several villages.“I had first gone to these villages with my father after a cyclone in 1988. Then again after cyclone Aila (in 2009), I went to these villages for relief work. My father had also visited these places,” she said.Kanjilal, who was known as the Sunderbans Man, died in January at the age of 85. He had set up the Tagore Society at Gosaba’s Rangabelia, which was his workplace for decades. The organisation later spread its activities to other blocks such as Hingalganj.“My father would get so anxious about the safety of the villagers every time there was a cyclone. Even when he was unwell, during Aila, he insisted on visiting the affected areas,” said Tania. “Through our father, we developed a strong bonding with the people of the Sunderbans and so I could not sit at home hearing about their ordeal.”Tania, the director of Bhoruka Public Welfare Trust, said she had gone with her team to these villages on a vessel with relief materials like dry food, bleaching powder, lime, tarpaulin and other items. She described to Metro the scale of disaster she saw and how villagers were fighting back.Tides at a villageA big dam had burst and river water flooded a village during the cyclone.“The river water had inundated the village and people were staying on first floors of concrete buildings, leaving their small houses,” she said. As it would take some time to repair the dam, river water is flowing in and out during high and low tides.“During high tide, the water level is rising by about 5ft from the ground. The level is going down during low tide but it still remains knee-deep,” Tania said.A group of former Jadavpur University students provided food and other relief materials to the villagers,” she said.No sweet water pondMalekenghumti village had four sweet-water ponds. While the cyclone was barrelling through the Sunderbans, brackish river water flooded the village and got mixed with sweet water of the ponds. Fish in the pond died and the water became unfit for use.“The villagers had to walk three-and-a-half kilometres deep into the island to collect water from a pond that was unaffected,” said Tania.Villagers have cordoned off the affected water bodies and added lime and bleaching powder to the water.Disease outbreakVillages have been witnessing outbreaks of diarrhoea, viral fever and skin rashes following the cyclone.“In most cases, people cannot go to a doctor because one has to cross two rivers to reach  the Hingalganj block primary health centre. The local health centres in the villages are ill equipped,” she said.",2020-05-06 22:00:00
510,Debraj Mitra,"Coronavirus Lockdown doodle art, from everyday items to migrants - Telegraph India"," The lockdown has prompted a young architect from Calcutta to create a series of doodles, his subjects ranging from ubiquitous household objects that don’t get much attention to the plight of migrant labourers.One illustration shows a pair each of slippers and formal shoes. “Feels like a dream! Never before have I been more in demand,” says the first pair. “I feel like a voter! Completely forgotten after the elections,” says the second.Another shows a man opening the door of a fridge, stacked with food and beverages. In the same frame, another forlorn-looking man is sitting under a tree. In the background are silhouettes of a woman and a baby, with bags strewn in front. “What will it be,” says the common caption.The illustrations have been generating a fair amount of online traction. They have been shared many times on Facebook and garnered hundreds of Instagram likes and comments.“This lockdown is unprecedented. Confined in our homes, our lifestyle has changed. There are the things we are using so much now. There are other things that are lying unused. I started thinking what if these objects, most of them inanimate, could speak. What would they tell each other? That was how this series happened,” Arpan Mazumder, 34, told Metro over the phone from Delhi, where he is now settled with his wife.The paintings are bright, simple and funny. They are based on different homely subjects and each work has a small story. The only common factor is the backdrop of the nationwide shutdown forced by the novel coronavirus.If the sketch on shoes focuses on the work from home culture, another deals with watering plants — a hobby picked up by many during the lockdown. The doodle shows two house plants, one of them a cactus. “All this extra love and care. May this time never end,” says the plant. “But this extra water every day is killing me,” replies the cactus.Mazumder did his schooling in Chittaranjan — his father was a railway employee posted in Chittaranjan Locomotive Works — and studied architecture in Jadavpur University. He worked for a year in Calcutta before doing his master’s from the School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi. He has since been working in the capital. His parents and a younger sister live in Kudghat.Mazumder loved painting as a boy and trained under a “mastermoshai”. But “had to let go because of the academic pressure” as he neared his secondary and higher secondary exams. His passion made a comeback when he studied architecture and started his professional life.He started a Facebook page called Doodle Bhai in July last year. The page now has over 650 followers on Facebook.One of his first albums was titled Nostalgia.His latest albums were not planned as a series. He made individual illustrations — during his free time between virtual meetings and other official work being done from home — and posted them on Facebook. “I got encouraged by the response.

The government’s order was effective till further change and the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) had advised the banks on August 13, 2020, that all branches shall remain closed on Saturdays till August 31.There was confusion among customers and bankers whether the closure of branches on Saturdays would be extended to September and this prompted the banks to raise their concern with the bankers’ committee.In a notification issued on Thursday, the state finance department announced that the July 20 notification stood cancelled with immediate effect allowing all branches to function on Saturdays except the second and fourth Saturdays of the month, as was the norm before the restriction was imposed.The SLBC said on Friday banks would resume their normal business hours (10am to 4pm for customers) from Saturday.

The hospital, too, urged the commission to decide on the matter,” he said. The commission then asked the family to pay Rs 1.2 lakh. “Both parties agreed to the decision,” the chairperson said. The official of Ruby General Hospital Metro spoke to said they would be in a position to comment on the case after receiving a copy of the commission’s order. The commission on Friday also took suo motu cognisance of a report in a newspaper that named six hospitals that were not displaying the rates for Covid-19 treatment.

The bins are placed in the corridors, which are extensions of aerobridges, and also in the baggage collection area, said officials.“We have about 25 such bins placed in several areas in the arrival section. The number has been doubled recently to further facilitate disposal of PPE by passengers.

On Tuesday, the city’s lifeline will have trial runs.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has come up with a detailed protocol to resume commercial services. But “crowd control and distancing measures” have stalled the resumption of services in Calcutta.Every Metro agency in the country barring Calcutta’s is a corporation with a limited government stake and increased autonomy. Calcutta Metro is with the rail ministry, which limits decision-making and efficiency.“We were ready to run trains in the run-up to the announcement of Unlock 3 guidelines… by June end, we were ready to resume services on a two-day notice,” Mangu Singh, the Delhi Metro chief, told Metro on Friday.Delhi Metro has 285 stations spread over 389km of tracks. The daily passenger volume was above 1.5 million before services were suspended.Calcutta Metro has 24 stations spread over 27km. The daily passenger volume was close to 600,000 before services were suspended.One meeting after another“We will have dry runs on September 8 and 9. An announcement of the date for the resumption of commercial services is likely after that,” a Calcutta Metro official said after a meeting — the second in two days — with state government officials on Friday.The modalities discussed include developing a system of e-passes and QR codes to be scanned at station gates. The code will be valid for a fixed time. “The government has proposed to develop a system of issuing e-passes to passengers. We will provide the information they have sought,” Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said.The Metro authorities had earlier announced that only existing smart card holders would be allowed access once services resume.A Metro Railway app to recharge existing smart cards is available on Google Play store.

Each Metro operates under different circumstances. Like three days in the next week are total lockdown days in Bengal. We are working with the state government to resume services,” Calcutta Metro general manager Manoj Joshi said.The government has been asking for the resumption of Metro services for over two months. The government had on Monday issued a notification saying total lockdown remained unchanged (September 7, 11 and 12). The notice said Metro services could resume in a graded manner from September 8.A retired engineer specialising in urban transport questioned the logic of pre-booking Metro slots. “The idea of Metro is a quick ride from point A to point B.

But the pandemic has taken away that source of income from him but not the spirit to fight and live.Skipping the exam was not an option for Halim’s son Sahil Ansari and they reached the city in a vehicle with a neighbour from the Digampur area in Patharpratima, even if it meant taking a loan for the travel.“There is no work for three months now.... I might be called back in September but I cannot say for sure,” Halim said. “In between there was some work… but that, too, is gone now.”Halim has to now depend on odd jobs like working in a farm or fishing to make ends meet.Before the lockdown, he worked for six days a week in Metiabruz and returned to Patharpratima for a day with his sons and wife.Halim dropped out of school after Class VIII but he hopes that his son does not have to do that. “When I was growing up we did not get that kind of support to continue with our studies... giving up and starting to work was an easy option.”But he now understands “the value of studies”. “Even for a few thousands I have to take a loan… at least I am trying for my son… we don’t know what fate has in store for him.”Sahil scored 83 per cent in Higher Secondary.“The only target is to get admission to a government college where expenses will not be that high,” Halim said.Sahil had the exam in the second half, after which he and his father returned to their village in South 24-Parganas.“Travelling by bus would have been cheaper but risky during the pandemic... the next exam is the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and I don’t want him to fall sick before that,” Halim said.",2020-05-09 04:13:00

I have to make it through one of the entrance tests.”Biswanath and his father Samiran Das took a bus to Calcutta from Kakdwip on Thursday. They got off at Esplanade and stayed at a hotel in Kankurgachhi to report to the centre at 7.30 am.“The hotel charged us Rs 1,000. It is a lot of money for me under the present circumstances,” Samiran Das said.Das used to buy whole turmeric from the market and get them grounded into powder before supplying it to grocery stores. “I don’t have the money to buy a machine… so, I used to go to someone who has one and get it grounded there.”Stores have reduced their purchase of turmeric during the pandemic. “People don’t buy turmeric in huge quantities… and now they have reduced the consumption of turmeric. Naturally, shopkeepers, too, are buying less,” Das, who is a graduate, said.“The pandemic has hit us badly. Earlier, I used to earn Rs 7,000-8,000 a month; now, it has gone down to Rs 5,000. I know what education means…. I don’t want my son to make the same mistakes I made,” he said.Das wants his son to acquire a skill so that he is well-prepared even if there are problems in employment. “For the next few years I understand the job situation will not be too good. But if he acquires a skill he should be able to manage and hopefully not struggle to earn.”The family resources are limited but the family hopes that Biswanath gets a good rank and maybe a scholarship. “His school Sundarban Adarsha Vidyamandir has helped him because he was a good student... if he is able to get a good rank I am sure people will come forward to help him,” Das said.",2020-05-09 04:16:00
519,Pratapaditya Mazumdar,Mother Teresa death anniversary: anecdotes from her life - Telegraph India,"Mother Teresa, who passed away on this day (September 5) in 1997, is always in my heart.I cannot forget the times my wife and I had the opportunity to be in her presence at Mother House and while accompanying her to her homes for the poorest of the poor.The core of Mother Teresa’s message was not that we should be charitable; it was that we must love. The poor suffer, she used to say, even more from rejection than from the lack of material possessions.Mother had shared with me and my wife anecdotes from her life.Once a gentleman had come to Mother and told her about a family with eight children who had not got anything to eat. Mother had recounted to us the joy she had seen on the face of the children and their mother when they had shared the food among themselves.“I had taken some rice for them. I saw the children, their eyes shining with hunger,” Mother said. Mother divided the rice among the children and left the room.“I didn’t take more rice that evening because I wanted them to enjoy the joy of sharing,” she said.Mother used to speak about the need to share the suffering of people everywhere, not only in the poor countries. She said she found poverty in the West much more difficult to remove.“When I pick up a person from the street hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread. I am satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person who is shut out, who feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, a person who has been thrown out from society — that poverty is so hurtful. Our Sisters are working amongst that kind of people in the West,” Mother had once said.I remember Mother speaking about her efforts to fight abortion through adoption. “We have saved thousands of lives. We have sent word to all clinics, to hospitals, police stations, ‘Please don’t destroy the child, we will take the child’.”Mother often urged unwed mothers to give their children to the Missionaries of Charity so that they could be taken care of.She had once recounted a story: “One evening we went out and we picked up four people from the street. And one of them was in the most terrible condition. And I told the Sisters, ‘You take care of the other three, I will take care of her’. So I did for her all that my love could do. I put her in bed, and there was such a beautiful smile on her face. She held my hand as she said one word only, ‘Thank you’, and she died.”I distinctly remember when Mother Teresa came to my Eastern Command Provost unit at Fort William in October 1992. Before leaving, Mother asked me if I could send the leftover food to her home for the poor. Mother Teresa always fed the hungry.I salute Mother Teresa who is now a Saint amongst us.Pratapaditya Mazumdar is a retired army lieutenant colonel",2020-05-09 04:20:00

522,Subhajoy Roy,CMC likely to introduce property tax waiver scheme - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is likely to introduce next month a scheme to waive interest accrued on unpaid property tax if allowed by the state government, an official of the civic body said.The authorities hope the waiver scheme would encourage property owners to clear their tax arrears, boosting the civic coffers that have been reeling under the Covid-19 pandemic.An official said the CMC’s income from property tax — its biggest income source —from April to August was 29 per cent less than what was collected in the corresponding period last year. Civic officials are pinning their hopes on the scheme to waive interest to cover the deficit in property tax collection and also increase the collection compared with last year.The CMC had last floated a waiver scheme in 2012 and the response was encouraging.“We have sent a proposal of interest waiver on unpaid property tax to the municipal affairs department. We hope to receive an approval soon so that we can float the scheme by early October,” said a CMC official.“We have proposed a complete waiver of the accrued interest so defaulters can come clean by paying only the principal.”Property tax defaulters together owe Rs 2,300 crore to the CMC. The amount does not include the interest accrued on the unpaid principal over the years. Most of the large tax defaulters are commercial establishments.“The waiver is a win-win situation for both sides. The defaulters look for a way to come clean by paying. If they do not need to pay interest, many of them will be keen to pay the tax arrears. For us, too, it is a good way to recover unpaid tax,” a CMC official said.“In times like now, when revenue earning has taken a hit, this scheme could help us strengthen our coffers.”The civic body’s main sources of income are property tax, trade licences and approval of building plans. The earnings from all three sources have dipped significantly since April, following the imposition of the lockdown to slow down the spread of Covid-19.Property tax collections, however, are ahead of the other two by a significant margin, said an official.Earlier, the civic body had decided to start visiting new housing complexes to help residents understand the nitty-gritty of property tax, in a bid to encourage them to pay their taxes on time. The visits were supposed to start in July but were postponed as Covid-19 cases saw a sharp spike that month.The CMC has also planned to provide a rebate to those who make online payments of property tax but it needs an amendment to the CMC Act, for which the Assembly’s approval is necessary.The civic body’s 2019-20 budget had set a target of Rs 1,021.50 crore as revenue from property tax. The target for collection from building plan approvals was Rs 131.77 crore and that from trade licences was Rs 73.54 crore.",2020-05-09 04:32:00

Retail sales have also seen a surge, they said.While traders attributed the rise in bulk demand to a surge in the work-from-home population, retail sales have jumped because of virtual classes for children, they said.“We had to procure close to 1,500 laptops from manufacturers over the past two months.

After a project is over, the machines are returned to the vendor.Most companies had only a certain percentage of its employees working from home before the lockdown. The number went up substantially after the Covid-19 curbs came into being.A multinational investment bank and financial services company has over 3,000 people working in Calcutta. “Before the lockdown, less than 30 per cent worked from home. But post-lockdown, the number shot up, leading to a demand for at least 800-900 laptops,” said a senior executive in the IT vertical of the company.A dealer in Chandni Chowk, who too requested anonymity, said when the city was in a standstill, his marketing team was “extremely busy”.“They are constantly answering calls and talking about the best-possible configurations and budgets,” said the dealer, who has seen “a 25 per cent growth in retail sales”.Dipanjan Purkayastha, the CEO of HyperXchange, an online-to-offline electronics marketplace, said: “The demand for laptops over the past month has been well over five times the normal demand.”The 45-year-old sells refurbished laptops, which come at a much cheaper price than brand new devices. He has now started home delivery across Calcutta and other parts of the state.Purkayastha attributed the surge in demand to “the need for more computing devices at normal middle-class urban homes”.“Till now, a typical home had one computing device, laptop or desktop. But now, if the parents are having to work from home, the children are also having to attend virtual classes. One device is not enough,” he told Metro.The lockdown has brought about a change in the working model of even non-IT companies, forcing them to invest more in work-from-home infrastructure.A company with mining interests, part of a big conglomerate, has 120-odd employees in Calcutta. Around 70 of them have been provided with laptops for working from home.“When the lockdown started, we had procured only 20-odd devices. But we have realised this is going to be the new normal and procured many more,” said Sourav Das, the chief information officer of the company.",2020-05-14 00:41:00
528,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak and the resultant economic downturn make hospital viable model hunt - Telegraph India,"The Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant economic downturn will make healthcare units change their operations and financial models, said officials of several hospitals.Some of the hospitals said they were not clear about what could be the right business model, while others have started to plan for the challenges ahead.Many hospitals have realised that gone are the days when an increase in cost could be passed on to patients.“Covid-19 is likely to stay for sometime and so we have to maintain social distancing in the hospital. Patient footfall will fall to almost half but at the same time, it would be difficult to raise prices because the corporates and individual patients would not have the capacity to pay like they did earlier,” said the CEO of a private hospital.The hospitals think job cuts and pay cuts would reduce paying capacities of patients. Insurance companies, too, will be reluctant to pay more.Metro spoke to officials of a number of private hospitals to find out how they are planning to change their business models and the possible effects on patients and employees.Capped pricesA hospital with more than 500 beds is planning more fixed-rate packages. The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, the regulatory body for private hospitals in Bengal, had earlier proposed fixed-rate packages at lower costs.The hospitals, however, raised objections saying their business would not be viable if they brought down the rates.They had also said fixed rates would not be feasible because a section of patients suffers from post-surgery complications.“Now, we are planning more fixed-rate packages for procedures and surgeries, but of course not at government health scheme rates. We have included 20 per cent more packages in the health schemes,” said an official of the hospital.Doctors, who were earlier unwilling to do such procedures at lower rates, are being requested to do so, he said.Another private hospital said it was holding discussions about fixing rates for critical care units. Patients often complain about huge costs incurred at ICUs, about which they say hospitals do not give them any idea at the beginning.“There are challenges of keeping prices fixed or predictable at critical care units because of the uncertain nature of treatment. But we have enough experience to know a possible cost for a particular condition and will fix an exit package,” said the director of the hospital.Some smaller standalone healthcare units are, however, raising prices. One such hospital has raised radiation therapy and bed charges, said sources at the hospital.“However, this may not work in the new situation at least for some months,” said an official of another hospital.EMIsElective procedures and surgeries have reduced significantly during the lockdown. But even then hospitals are getting requests for discounts and payments in installments.“We are receiving such requests almost every day, because the paying capacity of patients whose insurance coverage is not very high has reduced significantly. Private hospitals will have to allow payments by installments,” said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Superspecialty Hospital.After the demonitisation in November 2016, some hospitals introduced the EMI system. But it became less popular because of documentation issues and delay in processing the facility.Cost-cuttingThe move will include a reduction in manpower, pay-cuts and fewer consultation slots for doctors, he said. “If we run with 50 per cent patient capacity, manpower rationalisation will have to be implemented. Also, if fewer patients visit OPDs, doctors will get fewer slots, too,” said an official of a private hospital.",2020-05-14 00:42:00
529,Our Special Correspondent,Yoga guru Dibya Sundar Das dead at 68 - Telegraph India,"Dibya Sundar Das, the yoga practitioner who travelled across the world to spread the discipline, breathed his last in the city on Wednesday morning. He was 68.Das was admitted to the Institute of Neurosciences three months ago and he died at the hospital.Das had founded the first centre of the World Yoga Society in Salt Lake in 1986. The Society now has 10 centres in the city and 162 affiliated centres across the world.“Our father had taken four of us to yoga guru the late Yogindra Bishnu Charan Ghosh to learn yoga in the early 60s and it all started from there,” his elder brother Prem Sundar Das said on Wednesday.“The society was started to give people a healthy mind and body. This was what our father, Ashutosh Das, believed in,” Prem Sundar, adviser to the World Yoga Society, said.Das was born in Calcutta on April 27, 1952, and he did his masters from Calcutta University.He promoted yoga through different forms such as the yoga ballet or aromatherapy (using incense sticks to relax).He was the head of the yoga department at Dona Ganguly's dance school Diksha Manjari. 'The Diksha Manjari family is shocked and saddened at the passing away of our beloved Dr Dibyasundar Das…. We pray so that his soul may rest in peace,' she said in her condolence message.",2020-05-14 00:58:00
531,Brinda Sarkar,Lockdown township hits a high: New Town and Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Blood test, bank work, mobile phone repair…residents have lots of items on their “to do” list once the lockdown lifts. But for those who like their drink, there would be nothing more pressing than replenishing the mini bar at home.It’s been just over a week now that liquor shops have been allowed to do business and business is booming. Hundreds of customers are queuing for hours and walking home with bottles, smiling to themselves.Bottle in both handsNow in his 50s, Kajal Bose, the general manager of Aayash Hotel, had thought he had seen it all. And then he witnessed the crowds that thronged their off shop the first day of business after the lockdown. “It was unbelievable,” he says.The queue crossed several buildings and reached The Sonnet hotel. From there, it took a right turn till the Inifd building, took another right turn and went deep into the lane. Aayash Hotel staff had to carry mics and walk up and down the length asking people to stand at an arm’s length. Feeling sorry for the tipplers baking in the heat, they even offered them water.“I’ll never forget the looks on the faces of the first few customers that day,” says Bose. “They cheered, they danced, they showed the bottles to one another and said they had done it! One would think they had won World War III! It was then that I realised that liquor is no less than an essential commodity in our country.”A week later, the queues have reduced in length but they aren’t going anywhere. “Whenever I look, there are 100 to 150 people standing. I can never see the end of it,” says Pijush Paul, manager of Farina Bar cum Restaurant and off shop next to City Centre.“Like at ration shops people keep bricks in the queue as proxy and stand under nearby trees or stalls for shade,” says Paul. So long is their queue that the police is putting up a rope barrier after the first 15 people. As of Monday, lathi charges by the police were no longer necessary to rein in the crowd either.Prince & pauperThe queues comprise tipplers from all walks of life. There are savvy young men in shorts and tees, their hair done up in man buns and backpacks slung over their shoulders, as well as men in vests and chequered lungis folded at the knees. Some sport trendy reflective shades while others spread out their handkerchiefs on their pates to protect from the scorching sun.Every now and then a passer-by walks up to the counter and enquires if his poison of choice — usually whiskey — is available. If it is, he glances at the queue and decides whether to join it or not.“I ferried an elderly man here from CK Market for Rs 50,” said rickshaw driver Sanjib Kumar, who has made booze shops his new hunting ground. The frail-looking elderly gentleman had joined the queue for Silver Sands, opposite the City Centre petrol pump. “The gentleman said he would take my ride home if I could wait. I know I’ll have to wait for more than an hour but there are hardly any customers now so I have nothing to lose.”Proxy from the slumsSome shops had introduced separate queues for ladies but that was last week. “Since the ladies’ queue was shorter and faster, the men began to protest,” says Bose of Aayash Hotel. “They wanted gender equality, we wanted peace and so we  removed the second queue.”Farina had to discontinue their women’s queue too, although for a different reason. “There would always be 50-60 women in line but then we noticed that some of them didn’t look like they could afford such expensive booze,” recalls Paul. “Turned out that genuine buyers were paying Rs 50 to women from the nearby slums to pick up bottles for them!”Two for sorrowOn Monday afternoon, a shabbily-dressed, stocky young man walked out of an off shop near City Centre abusing the staff for handing him only two bottles despite the long wait in the sun.“This is a government rule during the lockdown and nine of out 10 people have accepted it. But some black sheep still want to create trouble,” confessed Tarit Dutta, who was managing the show at Silver Sands.Paul said they were pacifying customers by telling them that the shop will now remain open. “They can finish the bottles and come again,” he says.Bose has been using logic to show that rationing is but a feature of the lockdown. “Even when we go to the grocery store these days the vendor hands us two bottles of cooking oil and says ‘no more today’. We have to adjust,” he says.Then again some customers have found a way out. “I bought two bottles each from three different stores today,” smirked an elderly man who did not want to be named. He was seen at all three off shops in the City Centre backyard on Monday. “It cost me a few hours but at least I won’t run out of booze for the next few weeks. It was time well-invested.”Corona cessThe government is now charging 30 per cent extra for the bottles but most customers didn’t mind, especially since it was being used to tackle an urgent cause.Soumadeep Saha of AF Block gave it a qualified nod. “The extra cahrge is acceptable only if it is temporary. I remember how they had hiked the price of cigarettes a few years hoping to cushion the Saradha scam, but the prices never went down.”Sambo Sarkar, an AE Block resident also in queue, felt those buying booze should have indelible ink marked on their fingers. “And anyone with this mark should become ineligible for rations from the government. The tax is all right — other states are charging up to 70 per cent for it — but there should not be misuse of resources,” he said.The police and staff are also checking identity cards of those in queue. “We are only selling to local people,” says Rahul Khanna, managing the show at Sector V’s off shop Go Where.Their queues have been serpentine too with staff having to make announcements over loudspeakers to address the hopefuls. “The logic behind checking IDs is to ensure no one comes from afar, which could be a containment zone.”The scene onlineThose scared off by tales of long queues have the option of buying booze online at the West Bengal State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) website. Once the page opens, click on “back to home”, followed by “e-retail” and sign in as a liquor buyer.The system will locate you on GPS and connect you with the nearest shops. Once a shop accepts the order there will be a confirmation over phone. You can order a maximum of six bottles online that will be delivered to your home in a few hours.Too good to be true? Well, there is a catch. “Such is the rush for online liquor that the site is crashing within an hour of opening at 10am,” says chairman of the Mishra’s Group, Rajesh Mishra.Their IB Block off shop is shut as the block has seen some Covid cases and has been sealed off as a containment zone. They are operating online from New Town’s DLF Galleria mall. “If one manages to place an order, the system is smooth. We have hired four men on bikes who go over and drop off the consignments,” he says.Sector V’s Bakstage is another outlet that has gone online. “All on shops — which are joints where one can sit and drink — stock up on liquor before the party season in winter. They build up stock for three to six months at the time and so we are all loaded now,” says Sudhir Ahuja, director of Bakstage, adding that there is a difference between the clientele of off shops and on shops.“Eighty per cent of the people at off shop queues now are from low income groups who can wait four to five hours for a bottle. But someone buying single malt will never do that. He would be fine paying a premium to have it home delivered,” Ahuja explains.Online sales started last Friday and initially the retailers were charging a mark up of their choice on the bottles. But a few days down the line the government fixed the convenience charge retailers could levy at a maximum of Rs 300 per order.“This amounts to Rs 50 a bottle. It barely covers the cost of the delivery boy’s petrol,” says Mishra. “It makes no business sense to operate like this.”Initially Bakstage was readily sending cars to drop off booze everywhere from Park Street to Barasat but after the Rs 300 cap, that is no longer profitable. “Now we have to restrict ourselves to a 3km radius, mainly in Salt Lake,” Ahuja says.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-05-14 16:43:00
533,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Quiet days at the Alipore zoo - Telegraph India,"Cheerleaders are at work in one corner. Cupid has struck in another.Alipore zoo has remained shut to visitors for over a month and a half but keepers are trying to ensure life goes on as normal for 1,000-odd animals inside. Old-timers could not recall if and when the 144-year-old zoo, India’s oldest, had been shut for such a long time.The sprawling park, spread over 19 hectares, has been wearing an eerily deserted look. A team of around 60 —  comprising vets, keepers and guards —are on duty by rotation.The absence of visitors and with the din of traffic missing, the lives of animals and birds have been affected in different ways.Babu, the 36-year-old chimp and the biggest crowd-puller at the park, had remained holed up in the night shelter attached to his enclosure for most of the day in the first phase of the lockdown.“For the past week, a team of keepers has been calling out to Babu and cheering him up with claps and by clanging utensils. The plan seems to have worked. Babu is spending more time in the open enclosure now and is back to of his antics, like running with his hands up or swinging from the logs of wood erected over his head. But he is not 100 per cent his usual self yet,” said Asis Kumar Samanta, the zoo director.Around 25 metres away, near the main gate, the mood is upbeat inside the enclosure of the brow antlered deer — or Manipur dancing deer, as it is popularly known. “The deserted park is like a blessing for these shy animals. Earlier, they seldom appeared outside the night shelter during visiting hours. Now, free from stress, they are running around all day. Some of the deer have mated as well, after a long gap,” said a zoo official.The lengthy shutdown has also seen the arrival of a striped bundle of joy. On April 13, a foal was born to a zebra at the park. “The mother and baby are fine. The baby is the centre of attraction in the herd,” said the vet.Zoo staff who live in containment zones have been barred from entering. “Only those who live in the staff quarters in the compound are working. Temperature reading with a thermal gun is a must before entry,” said V.K. Yadav, member-secretary of the Bengal Zoo Authority.Only vehicles carrying food for animals are allowed.Even in the lean summer months, the zoo’s average daily footfall was around 6,000. A ticket for an adult was priced at Rs 30. But Yadav shrugged off the revenue loss.“The government has sanctioned a grant-in-aid of Rs 8.5 crore for 12 zoos in Bengal. We also have a corpus fund that we can tap during an emergency,” he said.",2020-05-14 21:00:00
535,Subhajoy Roy,More beds in Calcutta for migrant rush - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has launched a search for setting up more quarantine centres as Calcuttans stuck in other states start arriving by train, civic officials said.The civic body has readied a quarantine facility in New Town that Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the corporation’s board of administrators, inspected on Thursday. A building under construction in Anandapur is being converted into a quarantine centre. The New Town facility — a campus of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory — can accommodate about 375 people, corporation sources said. The centre at Anandapur, which is expected to be ready in 10 days, would be able to accommodate 400 people. A building of ESI Hospital under construction at Baltikuri in Howrah, about 12km from Esplanade, will also be used to quarantine contacts of Covid-19 patients.It can accommodate around 300 people.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted on Thursday that 105 trains will be bringing back people from Bengal stuck in other states till June 14. A list of the trains she tweeted says 25 of them will arrive at Howrah station. “Many of the people may need to be quarantined. Some of them could be migrant workers who will not have enough space at home to remain quarantined. So we will need more quarantine beds in the city,” a civic official said. A health team of the corporation is screening all those arriving from other states for Covid-19 symptoms at Netaji Indoor Stadium and advising quarantine as necessary.Hakim has also asked civic officials to ensure that no symptomatic person or contact of a positive patient living in a slum be kept in home quarantine. “Several people stay crammed together in a room in slums. They do not have space at home to stay isolated from other family members for 14 days. Therefore, such people should be shifted to the government created quarantine facilities soon,” said the CMC official.",2020-05-14 21:24:00

We did not go for an online assessment as many of our students come from the districts and suffer from poor connectivity,” Lohia said.“The departmental assessment committee will finalise the detailed method of assessment and grading in consultation with the controller of examination,” the official said.",2020-05-14 21:30:00
537,Sanjay Mandal,Calcutta hospitals take steps to protect nurses - Telegraph India,"Hospitals are training their nurses afresh and rearranging their accommodation to protect them from the novel coronavirus and ensure they don’t have to be quarantined in large numbers.Several hospitals, government and private, had to partially or completely shut down operations after asymptomatic patients tested positive for Covid-19. In most hospitals, nurses got infected in larger numbers than doctors.Many nurses, particularly in private hospitals and nursing homes, are from outside Bengal or districts and they stay in groups at accommodations provided by their employers. So, the infection spreads among them faster than doctors or others involved in healthcare.Charnock Hospital, in New Town, was partially shut for a month after 22 nurses and two doctors had tested positive for Covid-19. Around 50 other nurses were quarantined.Officials had said the infection had spread from asymptomatic patients who were admitted to the hospital for other ailments.“The hospital had to be shut down partly because of so many nurses becoming unavailable suddenly. Another reason was fumigation,” said Ipsita Kundu, the CEO of Charnock Hospital, which reopened on Thursday and resumed operations on a smaller scale. “We now need 50 nurses to run the hospital. Rosters have been prepared and every group of nurses will work for seven days at a stretch. The first batch has been put up at the hospital,” said Kundu. The hospital has been divided into three zones — red, orange and green. “Each zone has its own set of nurses. Their accommodations on the hospital campus are different,” the CEO said. Before reopening, the nurses and other employees had been trained afresh in dealing with patients.At Peerless Hospital, which, too, had suspended admissions after many doctors and nurses got infected, the nurses are being re-trained in the new treatment protocol.“It’s not possible to keep all nurses in the hospital…. So, most hospitals are making arrangements for nurses’ stay on the premises in batches,” the CEO of a private hospital said.At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, too, nurses deployed in Covid-19 wards have been staying on the Mukundapur campus in batches.“Steps have been taken to ensure nurses who are working together, stay together, so chances of cross-infection get reduced,” said R. Venkatesh, director, eastern region, Narayana Health, which runs RN Tagore hospital.",2020-05-14 21:40:00

Healthcare workers fall in the high-risk group,” an official said.“The tests will be conducted on two days every week and the process will continue.”The sentinel survey will cover Calcutta and Salt Lake, though the civic bodies in the two cities are conducting their own sample surveys.“This survey is going to throw insight into the Covid-19 situation, which is likely to be useful in data-based planning of control strategies,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, physician and a member of the task force set up by Mamata on Covid-19.Chowdhury said the state government’s global advisory board, chaired by Nobel laureate economist Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, had suggested that the government undertake the initiative.The large-scale movement of stranded people across the country has also necessitated such a surveyPublic health experts said the survey, which will require scaling up of testing facilities, could be an effective tool to keep track of the spread of Covid-19 in a particular area.“The data from the survey will help us develop a dynamic, real-time response to Covid-19 on the field,” a health department official said.The Indian Council of Medical Research has announced a separate community-level study. The Telegraph has reported that the study, to start later this month, would cover 400 households in 60 districts across the country.Six of the districts are in Bengal — Calcutta, South 24-Parganas, East Midnapore, Jhargram, Bankura and Alipurduar.",2020-05-14 21:46:00
541,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: School fee list bares depth of crisis - Telegraph India,"Only 100 of the 2,000-odd students of a church-run school in central Calcutta have paid the first quarter fees. The unusual number shows how “difficult” the financial situation is for parents, the school authorities have said.The problem is not limited to one institution — schools across the city are facing a similar situation. Many principals used the expression “unprecedented” while speaking to Metro about it.Some parents have written to schools that their “businesses have been closed”, or “offices are not paying their dues” and that they are finding it difficult to manage expenses.In a school in Salt Lake, only 5 per cent of the students have paid the fees for the first quarter. “Under the circumstances we can only request the parents, knowing that many of them have not received their salaries. We are using the school reserves to meet the expenses and pay members of our staff,” a school official said.In a private unaided school in south Calcutta about 40 per cent parents have not paid school fees for the past two months.The school authorities said there were “defaulters” otherwise as well, but this time some of the parents who “never missed the date” were among them.It is difficult to pay school fees in the absence of business since the Centre announced the lockdown, a businesswoman whose child is in Class II in a New Town school said. “We have to pay house and office rent and salaries to our members of the staff. We do not know when we would be able to restart the business and when it would pick up,” she said.In a central Calcutta school affiliated to the Bengal board, which has a large section of students whose parents are traders in New Market or Burrabazar, less than 5 per cent of the students have paid school fees, a school official said.The managements of a school off the Bypass, a group of schools in south Calcutta and an ICSE school in south Calcutta have extended the date for payment of the first quarter fees till June.Parents are deferring the payment because they know they do not have to pay late fees, officials of these schools said.They are now paying the non-negotiable expense such as house rents and electricity charges, a school official said.“Parents, many of whom are into businesses, do not have cash… they want to hold on to their savings for emergencies, worried about the future if the uncertain times continue,” the head of a central Calcutta school said.The central Calcutta church-run school has asked parents to make monthly payments instead of the entire quarter. “Now, payments have started trickling in… if the situation continues for long it will be difficult,” the principal said. “It is difficult to expect parents of two kids to pay the fees for three months  for both.”Schools have extended the deadline of payment of the first quarter fees or have given concessions under some heads, but they are not considering a “fee waiver”.“It will open the floodgates because times are uncertain and then many will start approaching us. We can delay but not waive the fees,” the principal of another church-run school in south Calcutta said.An institution has to be “financially healthy”, the head of another school said.",2020-05-14 22:01:00
543,Kinsuk Basu,Top concerns of coronavirus lockdown: Depressed kin and job loss - Telegraph India,"Helplessness in dealing with a depressed family member, anxiety about job, feeling of being cut off from loved ones or friends — a helpline started by the health department has thrown up some disturbing insights into the minds of people confined to their homes for over 51 days.The toll-free helpline offers free consultation by psychologists.Callers have also expressed fear about family members resorting to an extreme step or sought advice on how to tackle someone who “seems to be withdrawing into a shell”. Many others have sought ways to battle a growing fear of joblessness or feeling incompetent for being out of the usual work routine for several weeks.“An insurance agent, for instance, said he would meet at least 15 persons every week and he was so good that almost every meeting would fetch him returns,” said a psychologist, who has been attending to some of the calls on the helpline. “He said he was not sure if he would be able to retain his clients without meeting them for over a month now and what would happen to his job.”The helpline (1800 313 444 222/ 033 23412600),  recently launched by the health and family welfare department, is open between 11am and 5pm every day. A caller is allotted a specific time the next day when he can call back and speak to a psychologist for free.Two senior psychologists from the Institute of Psychiatry have been receiving calls for psychological counselling. Most of the callers are aged  25 to 50.Several callers said they were feeling isolated, unable to meet familiar faces and “struggling to relate to the new world”.“Someone who is used to meeting one of his favourite colleagues or a tea vendor at a particular stall or a close friend regularly is unable to do so now. This sense of loss is leaving many with a feeling of not being able to relate to their world,” said another senior psychologist.One caller asked: “Is it true that none of us in this world knows what to do in this situation as the virus keeps spreading?”Doctors have been patiently listening to the concerns and anxieties before making specific suggestions to battle the mental stress.“We are advising family members to come together for a meeting. Each one should then share his view about the pandemic. This exercise would allow each of the members to speak up and voice their anxieties,” Pradip Saha, the director of the Institute of Psychiatry, told Metro. “We are counselling people how to be productive with one's particular skills even when locked up at home.”One way could be to return to one's hobbies — singing, dancing, penning poems or sewing. “This would make people feel confident about their capabilities and also leave them with a sense of  empowerment,” one of the doctors said.",2020-05-14 22:12:00
544,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus pandemic: Look how some treat Covid-19 hero - Telegraph India,"An orthopaedic surgeon who had volunteered to join the fight against Covid-19 at his workplace in East Midnapore, and did what many doctors are shying away from, allegedly faced his neighbours’ wrath on his return home to Calcutta last Saturday.Residents of the housing complex where the surgeon has an apartment allegedly protested his return, for a day after more than two months.He said the neighbours tagged his wife and son, who stay in the apartment while he spends most of his days in East Midnapore’s Egra for work, as potential carriers of the novel coronavirus.They allegedly complained to the residents’ welfare association against the doctor and also threatened to “report” against him and his family to the local councillor.The doctor, who resumed work at Egra Sub-divisional Hospital on Monday, told Metro that he had returned home for a day after spending the required number of days in quarantine at his quarters in Egra after the last Covid-19 patient had been discharged from his hospital.The doctor, who had last visited his home in February, before his son’s Class X board exams, said his son and wife were not stepping out fearing harassment by neighbours.A number of Covid-19 cases were reported at the Egra hospital, following which a clinic to scan the contacts of the positive cases had to be set up on an emergency basis.Ranjan Roy, the medical superintendent of Egra Sub-divisional Hospital, said the surgeon, despite not being involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, was one of the three who had volunteered to collect samples from suspects, a job several others were reluctant to do.“He is an orthopedic surgeon and was under no compulsion to join the team. But he took it upon himself to collect samples during the contact-screening process of Covid-19 suspects and inspired nurses, ground staff and even lift operators to overcome their fear and join the fight against the virus,” Roy said.“I heard about what he and his family had to face in Calcutta. It is shocking.”Back home, the doctor’s wife said: “I have not stepped out of home since the time I heard this. I am afraid they will harass me with baseless questions. My neighbours had lit lamps and banged utensils to show solidarity with frontline fighters. Now, some of them have lodged a complaint against us with the association.”She added: “We are living here for eight years. We have some very good neighbours and are relying on them in these trying times.”The doctor is back to treating orthopedic patients. While he was on his way to Egra, a member of the residents’ association called him up and told him about the allegations against him and his family.“I have not violated any rule. I completed my 14-day quarantine a month ago, after the last Covid-19 patient had been discharged from our hospital. Some of the people who are making these baseless allegations have taken my help in all types of medical emergencies,” the doctor said.On March 25, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said: “I am asking the administration to ensure that doctors, nurses and other health workers don’t face any problem. They should not face social boycott.

546,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Calcutta plan for taxis with extra fare - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government is working on a proposal to have taxis back on Calcutta’s streets against a 30 per cent additional charge on the metered fare.The idea came from taxi operators at a meeting on Thursday with transport department officials, who said they were “more or less okay with the proposal” but added that chief minister Mamata Banerjee would take the final decision. A formal notice may be issued in a few days so that the taxis can start operating from next week, officials said.Transport officials have already told bus operators that private buses should start plying across Calcutta and adjoining areas from Monday. If things fall into place, the taxis too could be back on the roads from Monday, officials said.“Only two passengers will be allowed in a taxi at a time, and only in the rear seat,” a transport department official said.“There will be a plastic sheet or screen between the taxi driver and the passengers. Every taxi driver must carry hand sanitisers (to be offered to the passengers when they climb in). Masks are mandatory for both drivers and passengers.”The taxis will be allowed to run between 7am and 7pm. To begin with, the passengers will have to calculate for themselves the 30 per cent additional charge on the fare. Over the next few weeks, the regional transport offices will come out with an updated fare chart.Calcutta has around 14,000 metered taxis, whose owners have for some time been demanding a fare revision. The Bengal government had last revised taxi fares in 2018, fixing the starting fare, for the first 2km, at Rs 30. Thereafter, the fare increased by Rs 3 every 200 metres.Taxi owners have been complaining the fare is woefully inadequate. With the government refusing to budge, many drivers had resorted to demanding a lump sum instead of the metered fare.“Almost half the taxi drivers have returned to their native places. The rest have been struggling to make ends meet. We’ll love to return to the roads at the earliest,” said Bimal Guha, president of the Bengal Taxi Association.Taxi operators said the 30 per cent additional fare would barely make up for the expected slump in the number of passengers during the lockdown period.",2020-05-15 00:19:00
548,Snehal Sengupta,Salt Lake: Covid report alarm after cremation - Telegraph India,"Police is on the lookout for nearly 30 people who attended the cremation of a Sukantanagar woman who died purportedly of a stroke but was later found to have been Covid-positive.The lady in her 50s suffered a stroke on May 9 and was rushed to a Lake Town hospital. But alongside treatment for stroke, the doctors conducted a swab test on her to check for coronavirus.Nonetheless the lady died on Tuesday morning and despite “stay home” orders, at least 30 people went in a procession to take her to the cremation ground.Minutes after the rites, the lady’s son received a phone call from the hospital, asking them not to step out of their homes. Her Covid-19 test results were in and the lady had tested positive.Panic spread like wildfire and everyone who had assembled fled. “All the relatives and neighbours ran away to their homes,” said the son. “My mother had not set foot outside the country but still contracted the disease.”Local councillor Jaydev Naskar said they were trying to trace everyone who had gathered there that day. “Five people, including her husband and son, have been found and sent in quarantine,” he said late on Wednesday.Sukantanagar, that lies between Chingrihata and Nicco Park, is densely populated, with two or three-storey houses standing cheek by jowl. The civic body sanitised the locality and the police has sealed off all lanes and bylanes leading to the lady’s home.  It could not be known whether the crematorium had been informed about the fiasco. The government has announced that Covid-19 casualties can be cremated only at an exclusive ground at Dhapa.Ambulance refusalIn Sreebhumi, an elderly couple who had booked an ambulance to get themselves tested for Covid-19 were refused the ride by the driver and helper after they realised the couple were displaying classic symptoms of the disease.The Sreebhumi couple are in their 70s and were suffering from health disorders. They suspected that they might have caught the dreaded virus and on Tuesday called a Salt Lake hospital to book an ambulance to pick them up.The couple live on the fifth floor of a building in Lahabagan and needed help to climb down the stairs. But no sooner did the driver and the helper realise that the residents were coughing and sneezing than they backed out.Distraught, the senior citizens called Sreebhumi Sporting Club, that sent some members over. Two of them even wore PPEs. “We carried the residents down and settled them inside the ambulance,” said a member.Fire and emergency services minister Sujit Bose, who is the chief patron of the club, then intervened and spoke to the driver.“The driver said they were scared for their lives so I instructed my boys to give them fresh pairs of gloves, masks, sanitiser bottles and asked them to ferry the passengers to the hospital safely,” said Bose, who also spoke to the hospital authorities to ensure a smooth sail.The couple have been admitted but as of Wednesday night, their test reports had not come in.",2020-05-15 09:58:00
550,Sudeshna Banerjee,Salt Lake: Coronavirus street art by Baisakhi residents - Telegraph India,"Residents of Baisakhi Abasan took to the streets, paintbrush in hand, to raise awareness about Covid-19.A huge coronavirus catches the eye from a distance as one approaches AMP Vaisaakhi Mall from Bidhannagar Bishyakabi Bidyayatan. Above it, there are visuals of three health workers promoting hand washing and a welcome message accompanying a sketch of a policeman. Under all of it is the message Amra korbo jai (We shall overcome).“We have sanitised our housing complex twice and distributed masks. This is another way we thought of raising awareness,” said president of Baisakhi Abasan Samity Radhagobinda Sil.Secretary Sukhendu Khamaru is himself an artist and designed the street art. “We started working on Saturday evening but a shower washed it all off in front of our eyes. We resumed work with distemper paint the next evening and completed after 2am,” he said.The committee wants to hold a meeting to pay respects to those who have fallen to Covid-19, both patients and health workers, as also the migrant labourers mauled recently on the railway tracks. “We shall do so once the lockdown ends,” Sil said.",2020-05-15 10:21:00
552,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Apartments clock more Covid-19 cases than slums in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"More Covid-19 cases are now being reported from “buildings” than slums, Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, said on Friday. A civic official said the mayor meant apartments and standalone houses by “buildings”.Hakim said about 30-40 cases were being reported from the city every day and a majority of them were from buildings. “The change has been apparent over the past seven or 10 days,” a CMC official said.Even a couple of weeks ago, most new cases were reported from slums, indicating that the coronavirus was spreading there because of the high density of population.The trend has changed over the past week or so across the city, officials said.The health department’s bulletin issued on Friday said 1,200 Covid-19 cases had been reported from Calcutta, 43 of them over the last 24 hours. “It is difficult to say how people living in standalone buildings and apartments are contracting the virus,” an official said.Hakim also said on Friday that the CMC had decided that if a case was reported from an apartment complex, only that complex would be turned into a containment zone and not the entire neighbourhood. The number of containment zones has come down to 286 in Calcutta. The Belgachhia slum and Rajabazar have been taken off the list, he said. CMC sources said no new cases were reported from these places over the past three weeks. There were 340 containment zones in Calcutta on May 11, the last time the list was published on the Calcutta police Facebook page. CMC officials said one reason for the drop in the number of containment zones was that in some places two adjacent zones had been merged. “This will benefit surveillance and screening. Earlier, the people living between two containment zones were not screened stringently. Now, they will be because they come under a containment zone,” said an official.Dum Dum fireA 56-year-old woman was trapped inside her house after a fire broke out on the first floor of a five-storey building near Nagerbazar, Dum Dum, on Friday afternoon, a fire officer said. Firemen used bamboo ladders to get her out of the building. Nobody was injured and a fire engine managed to douse the flames in 20 minutes, he said.",2020-05-15 22:12:00
554,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: College hard-sells location in green zone - Telegraph India,"A private engineering college of Bankura is trying to attract students, riding on its location within a “green” zone on Bengal’s Covid map.A district is labelled “green” if it reports no new infections for 21 days and Bankura is among the five Bengal districts on that list currently.Although the status is impermanent in nature, Bankura Unnayani Institute of Engineering has tried to cash in.“We have to live with corona in the ensuing days and prospective guardians must consider admitting their wards in a college situated in a green zone and remain free of worry,” reads a print advertisement released by the institute.Sasanka Dutta, the chairman of the college, told Metro over the phone that at a time when places like Calcutta have multiple hotspots, it would be safer for parents to admit their wards to a college 218km away from the city. He stressed how thinly populated the area around the college was and “so full of greenery”.“I don’t think guardians would find institutes in and around Calcutta a safe option to admit their children in the wake of a pandemic that is likely to stay. They should come to our campus. We are in the green zone. We offer good placements,” said Dutta.Any other time, placements would have topped the list of benefits offered. Marketing professionals and ad men loved his pitch.“They have made a claim that could immediately strike a chord with prospective parents ahead of the admission season,” said Kanchan Datta of Inner Circle Advertising. He suggested that the college could take the pitch further and promise ahead of others that it would strictly abide by the physical distancing norms within the classrooms, canteens and hostels.“For the immediate, they opted for a more sensational spin,” added Datta.A marketing professional said the text was also trying to drive home the point that institutes in less populated zones were a safer option to pursue studies during a raging pandemic. “Corona is perceived by many to be an urban outbreak. The language of the advertisement has sought to play on this sentiment,” he said.But the green label could be short-lived, warned a health official. If a case is reported in a “green” zone, it immediately gets converted into an “orange” zone. Sabyasachi Sengupta, former vice-chancellor of the state tech university to which the college is affiliated, said the advertisement gave a signal of things to come.“As the days progress, colleges would compete to draw students based on how many Covid-19 cases are reported from that area. It is hard to imagine that a district would remain a ‘green’ zone forever,” said Sengupta.",2020-05-15 22:28:00
556,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Patients’ big pain: rude staff - Telegraph India,"Several patients who were recently discharged from three government-run Covid-19 hospitals in Calcutta said lack of empathy from a section of healthcare workers was the biggest problem patients were facing.Patients who were treated at Infectious Diseases and Belegata General Hospital, MR Bangur Hospital and Chittaranjan National Cancer Research Institute (New Town campus) cited problems such as dirty washrooms and delay in getting food. But all of them said they were most hurt by misbehaviour of hospital staff, resulting from a lack of empathy. A man who was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital, along with his wife and their two-and-a-half-year-old son, alleged: “The nurses would never come near us. They would wrap medicines in paper and throw them at us. We had to catch those. I learnt from my wife that the scene was the same in the female ward, too.”The family was in the hospital for three days and none of the three tested positive for Covid-19. “On all three days, if we wanted to speak to the nurses, they would shout and ask us not to go near them. We were told to shout if we had anything to ask,” said the man.He also alleged that plates containing patients’ meals were brought on stretchers and kept on the floor. Patients would be called by bed numbers and asked to pick those up. “On the first day, they pointed at a place and said we had to collect our water bottles and bedsheets from there,” he said.A man who was admitted to the Beleghata hospital and discharged recently said: “I stayed there for 15 days and not even once did any nurse check my temperature or blood pressure. Nurses were staying away from patients.”Another man admitted to the hospital said the patient beside him had once told a male nurse that he did not get the afternoon tea. “‘Go complain to chief minister Mamata Banerjee’ was the reply,” the man said.He also alleged that the nurses would often forget giving him medicine in the morning. The two men who were admitted to the ID hospital, however, said doctors were kind to them. “But doctors would not change their gloves while collecting swab samples. One day, when I pointed this out to a doctor, he cleaned his gloves with a hand sanitiser.”At CNCI New Town, a man who got admitted around 6pm did not get anything to eat or drink well past midnight. “Food was finally served after some heated argument,” he said.There were also allegations of dirty washrooms and wards not being cleaned every day.“My bedsheet was not changed for a week,” said a man who was admitted to the ID hospital.“Things have improved.... But there are some issues like fear among a section of healthcare workers, which we are trying to address,” an official said.",2020-05-15 22:48:00
558,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Precaution prolongs bus wait in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Sovabazar, 90 minutes. EM Bypass, 45 minutes. Taratala, 75 minutes.The wait for buses on Calcutta roads is a test of patience for people who have started stepping out of their homes in search of livelihood. Even if a bus does come after a long wait, there is every chance a passenger will not get a place on it, because of the social distancing norms.Sekhar Sarkar, who lives in Sovabazar, supplies print cartridges and paper for a living. He stepped out on Friday to go to an office in Bhowanipore to collect dues for an earlier order. “I waited for one-and-a-half hours at Sovabazar. I saw only two buses, neither headed in my direction,” said the 58-year-old.Eventually, a private vehicle dropped him on Elgin Road for Rs 120.Since May 13, the West Bengal Transport Corporation has been running around 400 buses on 13 routes. This was in addition to around 100 buses that were pressed into service since end-March to ferry staff on emergency duty.With most of the city holed up indoors during the lockdown, the scarcity of public transport had not been felt. But with some curbs lifted, people have been stepping out over the past few days and the lack of buses is taking a toll on them.Bapi Saha, a Garia resident who runs a grocery store off Hindusthan Road, stood at the Gariahat crossing for close to two hours on Thursday evening, waiting for a bus home.He saw two Garia-bound buses pass by with only a few passengers and waved to both to stop. The first bus did not stop. The second bus did, because the signal had turned red. Relieved, Saha tried to board the bus, only to be told off by the conductor. “Aar lok newa jabe na. Social distance maante hobe (We cannot take any more passengers. You have to maintain social distance),” he told Saha.Buses are barred from carrying more than 20 passengers, according to government guidelines.But several people alleged that buses with less than the prescribed number of passengers were also not stopping at designated halts.“I stood at the Taratala crossing for close to one-and-a a-half hours on Thursday evening, waiting for a bus to Joka. A bus did come but the driver did not stop the vehicle. There were only a handful of passengers inside. The number could not have been more than 15,” said an employee of a pharmacy in Thakurpukur, who had gone to a distributor’s office in New Alipore.The drivers and conductors of state buses are government employees and their wages are not linked to ticket sales.A senior official of the West Bengal Transport Corporation said there would be more buses on the road from Monday. “There has been a 20 per cent rise in demand and, accordingly, the frequency is being increased,” he said.Another official said running buses with just 20 passengers will always remain a challenge because an increasing number would want to commute. “Once private bus operators join, things can probably look up. But just a bit,” he said. Additional reporting by Kinsuk Basu",2020-05-15 23:00:00

Bhubaneswar and Gaya have made it to the list of Indian cities the flights will land in but not Calcutta. The Telegraph spoke to two persons — a man in Dubai desperate to come back to Calcutta and a woman in Calcutta yearning to go back to Dubai.500 stuck in Dubai count daysA man from Calcutta, stuck in Dubai for close to two months now, is spending hours every day calling up the Indian consulate because he is desperate to come home.All his pleas are running into one roadblock — there is no flight to Calcutta even in the second phase of the Vande Bharat mission.“I am not alone. There are at least 500 people here who are waiting to return to Calcutta,” said the 47-year-old, who lives in Ballygunge.The man works as a consultant with a company that has a presence in Dubai and Calcutta. For the past year, he has been shuffling between the two cities. “I usually spend a fortnight in Dubai during every visit. This time, I had come in the middle of March and got stuck,” he said. He has been on an “unpaid leave” since April 1 and was asked to “leave his company’s guest house”.The man said he shifted to a hotel and was sharing a room with a fellow Indian from Kerala. “He got a booking on one of the flights to Kerala. I moved to a single bedroom on April 19. I am having to pay Rs 4,000 every day for stay and food,” said the man.In Ballygunge, the man’s wife and two daughters — aged 16 and 12 — are growing restless with each passing day.There are multiple flights to Bhubaneswar in phase two of the repatriation project. But those headed to Calcutta would not be able to avail themselves of the Bhubaneswar-bound flights because they had mentioned Calcutta as their “port” during registration for repatriation.“Once you have registered with one airport, you cannot alter it,” the Calcuttan said.The Dubai administration has recently relaxed the lockdown curbs.  Residents are allowed to move without a permit from 6am to 10pm. “But I don’t step out of the hotel for fear of contracting the virus. I cannot afford to fall sick now. I have to get back at any cost,” he told Metro over the phone.",2020-05-15 23:22:00
560,TT Bureau,Coronavirus pandemic: 185 nurses leave Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Nurses from several states have started leaving Calcutta, with as many as 185 nurses already taking a bus back to Manipur.Many nurses from Manipur and Odisha have resigned from private hospitals, including AMRI, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Belle Vue and Fortis, and more are expected to follow, officials said.The Manipur government issued a transport movement pass, seeking permission from other states to allow vehicles to move, on May 9 to take 185 nurses back to Imphal. The Covid-19 pandemic has created a demand for healthcare workers everywhere and many nurses wanted to return home because of family pressure, state government sources said.A nurse who spent over three years at a private hospital in Salt Lake reached Imphal on Thursday. “A bus was arranged by a local organisation. There were other nurses on it,” she said over the phone. “I came back because I did not want to work in a risky environment in Bengal. I will get a job here with my experience. If I don’t I will return to Calcutta once things improve.”A nurse with a private hospital off the EM Bypass said her family had been insisting that she return home. “My father has spoken to a small hospital here. I will get a job after quarantine,” she said. The exodus of nurses will cause a serious crisis for private hospitals in Calcutta, said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.",2020-05-15 23:30:00
561,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Peerless set to resume admissions - Telegraph India,"Peerless Hospital, which had suspended admissions earlier this month after many doctors and nurses had tested positive for Covid-19, is planning to resume operations from Monday with a new Covid-19 ward.Hospital officials said they would set up a new operating theatre for patients who would test positive for the disease or show symptoms.The 350-bed hospital off the EM Bypass had suspended admissions and some other routine services on May 5. More than 90 doctors and nurses had to be taken off duty because they tested positive for Covid-19 or had to be quarantined.“Now, most of them are back and we have completed fumigation and sanitisation of the entire hospital. So, we will be able to resume admissions and other services on May 18,” said Sudipto Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital.On Thursday, Charnock Hospital in New Town had reopened after being shut for about a month because nurses and doctors had contracted the novel coronavirus. The hospital had to restructure its wards and conduct sanitisation.Peerless Hospital has set up a 37-bed Covid-19 isolation unit, which includes a seven-bed critical care unit. The hospital had a smaller isolation unit before it suspended admissions.Given the increasing number of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases, the hospital has decided to expand the facility. The ward is “negative pressurised”, which means the air pressure inside is lower than that of the surroundings. The air from the Covid-19 ward will not be able to flow out and get mixed with the air in other parts of the hospital. “The air from the ward will be sucked out with the help of exhaust pipes and thrown out. We have spent Rs 40 lakh to set up the ward,” an official of the hospital said.The isolation unit has dialysis facilities, too.“Patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 at times need dialysis. This isolated dialysis unit will help reduce the risk of infection for other dialysis patients,” said Mitra.The hospital is also planning to set up an operating theatre for confirmed or suspected Covid-19 cases. “We have eight operating theatres but this one would be in the isolation wing,” said Mitra.",2020-05-15 23:38:00
562,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: 3-fold jump in private bus fare proposed - Telegraph India,"Private bus operators have come up with two sets of fare proposals — a minimum fare of Rs 20 and Rs 15 — for the government to take the final call.The minimum bus fare in Calcutta at present is Rs 7 and taking it to Rs 20 during the lockdown means close to a three-fold jump and Rs 15, a little over double.Operators and bus owners explained their reasoning behind the proposal. The carrying capacity of a 40-seater bus is 60 — 20 passengers are allowed to stand, according to union members.Reducing the total number of passengers to 20 during the lockdown means cutting down the passenger count by a third. The fare should therefore be raised three times, a member said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said buses would be allowed to ply but only with 20 passengers. Operators have to work out a fare structure and discuss the matter with transport minister Suvendu Adhikari, she has said.Adhikari had met the operators recently and asked them to come up with a revised fare structure so that running buses during the lockdown proved economical for owners and operators.“We have proposed Rs 20 for the first 4km,” Tapan Bandopadhayay, the general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, said. “Thereafter, Rs 5 for every 4km. So, if a passenger travels 20km, he/she will have to pay Rs 40 according to our proposal.”It is unlikely people will be willing to pay a minimum fare of Rs 20, another set of operators has said. So, Rs 15 as the minimum fare is more practicable, they have said.“Roughly that’s double of what one pays now,” Rahul Chatterjee, the secretary of the Bus Minibus Samannay Samity, said. The minimum fare for minibuses at present is Rs 8 for 3km and then Rs 9 up to 6km. Operators have proposed to raise the minimum fare to Rs 30 for 6km.The transport department will go through the proposals and announce its decision by next week, a department official said.",2020-05-15 23:47:00

Students are learning through online classes from home. The project work will help them utilise their time at home. Since we had already taken the decision for the 2020 ISC batch, we thought why not implement it from this year,” said Arathoon.According to a CISCE official: “ISC English is tough. Not all students are able to grasp the subject equally well through online classes. These students will benefit more from the project work.” Students who are “weak in math, too, will gain from the project work', the principal of an ISC school said.   The ISC English language and English literature papers are of 100 marks each.In math, ISC students are tested in one 100-marks theoretical paper.English is taught as a first language in every ISC school. The two project work papers, of 20 marks each, will be compulsory for all students.     The students are tested on the entire syllabus of English language and literature taught in Classes XI and XII.With the introduction of the project work, the theory paper in maths (Paper I) will have 80 marks.The 20-marks Paper II will require students to complete two projects of 10 marks each.In the Class XII project paper in English language, 10 marks will be reserved for writing skills. The other 10 marks will be allotted to listening and speaking skills.In the English literature project paper, too, writing skills will be of 10 marks.Of the remaining 10 marks, four will be allotted to presentation of a piece and six to understanding and appli-cation of knowledge and analysis.",2020-05-16 21:02:00
565,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Bengal govt rules out bus fare hike, hints at support - Telegraph India","The fares of private buses will not be increased and the government will try to bring in more state buses to cater to the rising demand, transport minister Suvendu Adhikari said on Saturday.“The fares of state buses have not been revised. Those of private buses will not be increased, too,” Adhikari said. “We don’t want to create inconvenience for bus operators. The government will try to provide support to them in some other form.”Private bus operators said they would sit down and discuss among themselves on Sunday before deciding on their course of action. “We didn’t volunteer to come up with any fare structure. The government had sought it,” said Tapan Bandopadhayay of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.  The minister said the operators of private buses would not be forced to roll out their vehicles. If any owner wants to ply buses following the existing fare chart, the government will provide him all help. Buses will run from 7am to 7pm. The minister said that from Monday, the number of app-cabs on the roads would go up, too. Like buses, the app cabs would only be for essential workers.  Adhikari’s negation of any possibility of upward revision of the fares of buses and minibuses came within a day of the private operators proposing separate plans for a hike. Some operators rooted for a 30 per cent increase in fares to make up for the losses they are expected to suffer because of the government’s order that a bus cannot carry more than 20 passengers to enforce social distancing.The Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, for instance, had proposed to the government that the minimum fare be Rs 20, compared the existing Rs 7. A few minibus operators had suggested a fare of Rs 30 for the first 6km, compared with the existing fare of Rs 17.“We will run more state buses from Monday,” Adhikari said. “The frequency of these services will be increased so that the waiting time is reduced significantly.”Since May 13, the West Bengal Transport Corporation has been running buses on 13 routes. On Friday, the fleet strength of eight routes was increased as the demand started rising and an increasing number of employees in the private sector are being asked to attend office.Senior transport department officials said a government bus would leave the depot every half an hour, instead of an hour, to cater to the rising number of passengers.“Senior officers across four police commissionerates — Calcutta, Howrah, Bidhannagar and Barrackpore — would be asked to increase deployment of cops at bus stops so that there is no unruly rush for boarding buses,” a transport department official said.",2020-05-16 21:23:00
566,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Old rumour effect still tells on chicken price - Telegraph India,"Chicken prices in city markets are hovering in the range of Rs 220 to Rs 250 a kilo, shooting up by nearly Rs 50 in the last 10 days, traders and consumers said.There is no immediate relief in sight as the supply constraint will take some time to correct itself, traders said.Several poultry firms had stopped breeding in the first half of March when the demand and prices declined because of a rumour that the novel coronavirus spread through chicken.By the time the demand picked up again, many firms had stopped production. Traders said it could take up to two months for the supply to normalise.Also, transportation problems during the lockdown have hurt supply, further pushing up the prices.Dressed chicken sold at Rs 230 a kg in Salt Lake’s BD Market this week. The prices were Rs 220 in Behala, New Alipore and Lansdowne, and Rs 200 in Maniktala and Garia.In Gariahat, chicken sold at Rs 250 this week, a Ballygunge resident said.“The price of dressed chicken varied between Rs 160 and Rs 170 a kilogram about 10 days back. On Friday, the price was Rs 210/220,” said Dipak Roy, a trader at Lansdowne Market. “The daily supply is half of what it used to be before the lockdown was imposed.”Roy said he had heard from his suppliers that poultry firm owners had stopped breeding when prices nosedived in early March.Several buyers said chicken prices hovered around Rs 150 in January and February. “I bought chicken at Rs 150 in January and February. Today, the price is Rs 200 a kilogram,” said Debayan Basu, a resident of Maniktala.In early March, when there was a steep fall in prices, traders sold dressed chicken even at Rs 90 a kilogram in some places. Customers dwindled and retailers were desperate to sell whatever they had bought.“It was during this time that many poultry firms stopped production to cut down losses,” said a trader.The prices stabilised a few days after the lockdown began on March 25. By then people had overcome the fear that chicken consumption could lead to being infected with the coronavirus. But then the effect of a drop in supply - because of transportation problems and several poultries stopping production - could be felt.An official of the West Bengal Poultry Federation said many poultry firm owners lost lakhs of rupees when prices nosedived in early March.Madam Mohan Maity, the general secretary of the federation, cited another reason for the recent rise in chicken price — an increase in production cost during this time of the year. “Usually a chick grows to weigh 1 kg after eating 1.8kg of food. But during summer, the animal needs 2.2kg or more food for gaining 1kg weight. This increases production cost and naturally the price of chicken in the retail market goes up,” said Maity.",2020-05-16 22:00:00
567,Jhinuk Mazumdar, Coronavirus Lockdown: Teachers upset with parents’ interference - Telegraph India,"Parents have been taking down notes, giving instructions to their children or even prompting answers during an online class, forcing teachers to tell them to let the children be on their own.Teachers said parents could provide technological support to the children, especially to those in junior classes, but over-enthusiasm during a class is affecting the teaching-learning process. Besides, multiple instructions to children - from the parents as well as teachers - can confuse the young ones.“The child is unable to function independently and he or she becomes dependent on the father or the mother. In fact, sometimes the parents are so overbearing that the child ends up listening to them and the teacher is only a figure on the other side of the screen,” said Herbert George, the principal of MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School. On some occasions, the child has to navigate between two sets of instructions, which George said could leave the little learner “flummoxed”. At South City International School, parents have started taking down notes or telling the child to be fast because the teacher will move to the next topic. At Newtown School, teachers have heard parents calling up their friends or relatives to brag about how well the child is attending online sessions or prompting answers to the little ones while a class is on.“Parents should provide only technological support and not interfere in the academic content of what is being taught.  If they start doing that and solve problems for their children, it will not be the right kind of teaching-learning,” said Suvina Shunglu, the principal of Sri Sri Academy.In some institutions like South City and MP Birla, teachers are telling the parents to let the children be on their own. “We measure our words while we address the parents or we tell the children to focus on what the teacher is saying,”  said Sejal Arora, the pre-primary head at South City. At Newtown School, if teachers feel that parents are interfering in academic activities too much,  a mail is sent to them. “We do not want to embarrass the child by addressing their parents in front of their friends, so teachers make a note and we send a mail to them,” said principal Satabdi Bhattacharjee. Psychotherapist Farishta Dastur Mukerji said the baton of the classroom had shifted from the teacher to the parent. “If there is over-monitoring or over-interference from the parent, the child’s confidence will take a hit in the long run. A huge part of the classroom is to build on their ability to speak up for themselves or socialisation skills, which can be compromised with over-monitoring,” said Mukerji.",2020-05-16 22:10:00
568,Sanjay Mandal, Coronavirus pandemic: Complaints of PPE overpricing - Telegraph India,"The state’s regulatory commission for private hospitals has received several complaints over the past few weeks that healthcare units are overcharging patients for personal protective equipment and N95 masks.The state government, worried over the rise in the number complaints about malpractice in regard to protective gear for Covid-19, is trying to figure out what could be the actual price range for such items and how to address the issue, said officials.A Calcuttan has alleged that a private hospital off EM Bypass has charged Rs 84,000 for 20 hours for treating vertigo. The charges include Rs 12,000 for PPE and Rs 2,000 for masks.“.... charges Rs 84000, Covid 19 (test) and investigation checkup charges 35000, PPE kits 12000 for 4 persons and 2000 for mask for 4 persons for one day,” the man wrote in a social media post. A purported photograph of the bill has also been posted.  Officials of the hospital said they were not aware of the incident. “We have received some complaints that private hospitals are overcharging patients for PPE and masks. We’ll be dealing with these complaints at an appropriate time,” retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, said on Saturday.The commission, set up by the Mamata Banerjee government, is the regulatory body for private hospitals and nursing homes in the state.The Telegraph has reported how the commission had expressed concerns about overcharging patients for PPE by some private hospitals.The number of complaints has grown since as private hospitals have started treat-ing non-Covid patients in increasing numbers.“We are not getting PPE or masks from the government. So, we have to charge patients for these items. We are charging them the maximum retail price mentioned in the price tag,” said a senior official of a private hospital.However, the problem, according to some private hospitals, is the varying MRPs, depending on the quality of PPE and masks.In the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, a complete PPE set was as expensive as Rs 2,000. But now, with many small units making those gear, the procurement for a private hospital varies between Rs 300 and Rs 1,200, sources in the healthcare industry said.One hospital in south Calcutta said it was charging Rs 777 for each PPE set.“The confusion is created because we are dealing with something new. Patients and their relatives are unable to know what is the quality of the PPE and in many cases, how many are actually used by healthcare workers to treat one patient,” said the CEO of a private hospital chain.“We cannot compromise on the quality of PPE and expose doctors and health-care workers to the novel coronavirus. Many doctors are refusing to treat patients without good PPE,” said an official of a private hospital.There were controversies over the pricing of coronary stents, which are inserted after opening clogged arteries. In 2017, the Centre had capped the prices of stents.State health department officials said it was too early to think of such price capping for PPE.“We have not discussed it,” said an official of the department.The regulatory commission had earlier proposed capping of charges for some treatment but the private hospitals had rejected it.",2020-05-16 22:25:00
569,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Pool test advice for quarantined in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The health department has advised testing centres to pool test all contacts of Covid-19 patients who have been quarantined to speed up the testing process. Earlier, those quarantined would be tested individually. A pool test — which involves testing a mix of samples —would allow ruling out the disease in a large group of people at the same time.  The health department had earlier suggested pool tests for people from particular containment zones in Calcutta - such as parts of Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Tiljala, Tangra, Burrabazar, Posta and Rajabazar. Now, the net would be spread to include the quarantined contacts of positive cases. Senior health department officials said the guiding principle behind the move was to utilise the available resources to carry out the maximum number of tests in as little time as possible so that the suspects could be screened faster.A preliminary test is carried out within two days of a contact being quarantined. The results decide whether the person would be sent to a Covid-19 hospital or quarantined -- at home or at a government facility -- for 14 days. 'Pool tests for the quarantined would help in deciding faster whether the persons tested need to be admitted to a Covid hospital or kept in observation,' an official of the health department said. 'If a pool of samples tests positive, each sample will be tested individually. If a pool tests negative, for persons in quarantine in the early days, it means these persons will have to undergo another test after 14 days, before they are released.'There are 11 ICMR-approved government testing centres for Covid-19 across Bengal, including six in Calcutta. Each of these also tests samples from designated districts. There are another six private testing centres across Calcutta. Health department officials said state-run centres had been struggling to test several hundred samples every day with a handful of laboratory technicians and a few faculty members from the department of microbiology at various institutes.The testing centre at the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, for instance, has tested nearly 1,000 samples each on Friday and Saturday. The School of Tropical Medicine has been testing over 400 samples daily over the past few days.",2020-05-16 22:58:00
570,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Protocol for train passengers in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Thousands of people have come to Howrah station on trains from Delhi since partial resumption of passenger train services.The 20-coach train that is travelling between Howrah and New Delhi can carry 1,028 passengers.The passengers are undergoing a two-layer check for Covid-19 symptoms — a temperature check at railway stations and a swab test at government health centres or hospitals — followed by a 14-day quarantine at home or a government shelter. The Telegraph spoke to officials in the state government and the railways and several passengers to figure out the drill. Thermal checkAll the passengers are being screened for body temperature with a thermal gun twice — in New Delhi and Howrah. “Till Friday, we did not find anybody from Delhi to be symptomatic. If someone is found running a temperature or other symptoms, he or she will be taken for further tests,” said an official of the health department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Swab testAfter the thermal screening at Howrah, the passengers who live in Calcutta and fringe areas are being taken to Netaji Indoor Stadium, where a health team of the CMC is screening them for Covid-19 symptoms and advising quarantine as necessary.People headed for far-off districts are being ferried on state buses to their destinations.Government health workers have a database of all passengers arriving on trains. 'We are trying to collect swab samples of everyone within 48 hours of arrival,' said a health official. Some of the buses ferrying passengers are stopping at a centre for collection of swab samples.A passenger on the train that came on Thursday, a 39-year-old goldsmith, was put on a bus headed to Hooghly. The bus stopped at a medical camp on Delhi Road where all occupants underwent swab tests and another round of medical examination.A certificate the man got from the camp says he “was found to be afebrile (non-feverish) at the time of examination”. “Incumbent is advised home quarantine for 14 days,” said the certificate.The passengers who are reaching their destinations without a halt are being contacted by local health workers and volunteers who are arranging their swab test schedule at a nearby hospital or health centre. Keeping a checkOfficials in the health department said all people arriving on trains were being monitored but all were not being asked to spend the 14-day quarantine at government institutions.“The Centre has said that even Covid-19 patients who have mild symptoms or are pre-symptomatic can stay in home isolation. Under such a situation, there is no point in keeping all passengers in institutional quarantine. People who can stay in isolation at their homes may well do so,” said an official.A 27-year-old passenger, who worked at a textile unit in Delhi, is spending quarantine at his village home in Murshidabad. A local health volunteer visited him to check whether he was following the “quarantine protocol”.",2020-05-16 22:59:00

But flights got cancelled, too, and they are yet to get any refund.Left in the lurch, some of the youths are seeking help from an NGO to be able to set foot in Kashmir.Arif and Umar are among the group of 25 youths from Kashmir who had come to the city at the onset of winter last year.An MSc in mathematics, Arif said they had found themselves cash-strapped because customers spread across south Calcutta were not paying them. “My customers owe me Rs 60,000. They are not paying up citing the lockdown,” said Arif, who stays in a rented flat with a group of four in Baghajatin. On March 23, five of them had booked tickets for a flight on March 27. Each ticket cost Rs 29,112.“Then the airline said air traffic has been suspended from March 25 because of the pandemic. When we sought refund, they said the amount would be adjusted when we would make fresh bookings till February 28, 2021,” Lone told Metro.Each had earlier booked a train ticket from Howrah for a journey up to Delhi by the Himgiri Express, spending Rs 915. Reaching Delhi on March 24, they were to take a connecting train to Jammu. “The railways have said they would refund the booking amount later,” said Umar.The railways have decided to run fully AC trains from Tuesday. The two-phased journey would cost them Rs 4,000 on an average, said Arif. The traders have survived so long because an organisation called “Humans of Patuli” was delivering essentials to them. Some of them have again approached the organisation for helping them arrange the train fare. Dwaipayan Banerjee, the convener of the platform, said they had raised Rs 29,000 and handed over the money to them.",2020-05-16 22:59:00
572,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Scottish Church teachers’ aid - Telegraph India,"Children living in shanties in Bagmari are getting something to eat during the lockdown because some teachers of Scottish Church College have extended a helping hand to feed as many as they can.The teachers have raised a corpus to help children and their families in slums off Canal East Road, in north Calcutta, which they had adopted two years ago.A college teacher said the children are students of primary school called Sabuj Mon, located barely a kilometre from the college on Duff Street.They began putting together resources last month and so far have delivered kits with rice, pulse, egg, soybean and other items on five occasions at an interval of nine days.Children aged between 5 and 10 come to the school along with their parents and the non-teaching staff hand over the kits to the parents. The teachers who stay closeby help the non-teaching staff in the distribution.The school was set up at a college property at 27 Canal East Road two years ago, around the time the slum was adopted as part of the college’s outreach activity.Arpita Mukerji, the principal of the college, said they were concerned about the health of the children and were carrying out the drive to help them maintain their health amid the raging pandemic.“We know how poor and helpless they are. It was time we did something for them to help them survive the crisis,” vice-principal Supratim Das said. Mukerji said, when the kids came to the school before the start of the lockdown, they would get a steady meal. “But now that has stopped. If they don’t get the nutrients steadily, their immunity level would drop and that would leave them vulnerable. We are trying our best to prevent it,” she told Metro.",2020-05-16 23:14:00
573,Debraj Mitra,Grocery help for families in Sunderbans - Telegraph India,"Recently, word spread in villages in Sunderbans’ Kultali that free groceries would be distributed from the local forest beat.Since early morning —  the distribution was slated to have started from 9am — small boats ferried scores of villagers across the Matla river to the Kultali beat office. Around 250 families got groceries at the camp, organised by two NGOs in coordination with the forest department.The recipients are mostly dependent on the river for their livelihood. The men and some women step out of their homes with small and big nets to catch fish and crabs. They sell their catch to traders. The catch changes multiple hands before reaching big markets in Calcutta. A large portion is exported.On paper, there is a ban on fishing from April to June. People, however, flout the ban every year, but since the lockdown has crippled the supply chain, there is hardly anyone these people can sell their catch to. Which means they are not going out to catch fish or crabs. “We don’t have land. The food we get is dependent on the labour we put in every day,” one of the recipients is heard telling a volunteer distributing groceries. Two NGOs — HEAL (Human Environment Alliance League) and PUBLIC (People United For Better Living In Calcutta) — coordinated with the forest department to organise the aid.Each kit contained 5kg rice, one-and-a-half kilos of potato, a litre of oil, 350gm of soyabean, six eggs, two packs of biscuits, soaps and masks.“We have already provided food to over 3,500 families,” Santosha GR, the divisional forest officer of South 24 Parganas division.",2020-05-16 23:15:00

575,Debraj Mitra, Coronavirus pandemic: Paralysed septuagenarian forced out of rented flat in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A septuagenarian lady, just out of hospital, was hounded out of a rented flat in Dhakuria by some residents for fear of “the spread of Covid-19 from an outsider”, her son has alleged.The woman, paralysed for the past seven years, was admitted to a private nursing home in Gariahat for close to two months for acute arthritis and bedsore. She had to be taken out on Saturday, before the clinic was shut down because the Covid-19 crisis has led to the absence of many doctors.The doctor treating the 75-year-old woman, a co-owner of the nursing home, said she “did not have any symptoms of Covid-19”.The woman was brought to the ground floor flat of a building in Dhakuria’s Telipara around 3pm on Saturday. Her son, Bhaskar Sinha, had rented the flat because his apartment in the same neighbourhood “did not have the infrastructure to accommodate a 24X7 attendant my mother would need”.By evening, he was forced to shift his mother to his old flat because the protesting residents did not budge even after a stand-off for hours and police intervention. “I showed all the prescriptions and other medical documents (to show his mother was not a Covid-19 patient) to the police and they were satisfied…. But the mob of more than 100 people became aggressive, completely ignoring social distancing norms,” Sinha wrote in his complaint with Garfa police station over WhatsApp. “Most of the men were not wearing masks. Some of the women had towels wrapped around their faces. They kept abusing me.”The Centre as well as state governments have stressed the need to fight the disease and not discriminate against patients, a point reiterated multiple times by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Mobile phone caller tunes and public announcements, too, have stressed the same message.Saturday’s incident shows how unsubstantiated fear running deep in people’s minds can create social fissures.At least two residents who witnessed the fracas, the cops and the local councillor told Metro that a possible trigger could have been the door of the flat, which was locked from outside.“We got a call. The caller said a woman was lying inside a flat that was locked from outside. The woman’s son came after a short while,” an officer of Garfa police station said.“The group that had assembled asked him to either take his mother to his own flat or live with her in the new flat. He eventually agreed to take his mother to his old flat,” the officer said.The woman’s son has said that he sent a complaint to the police station over WhatsApp but no formal case has been drawn up so far, the officer said.The councillor of Ward 92, Madhuchhanda Deb, said the problem started because he had locked the flat from outside. “People got suspicious,” Deb said.Sinha said he had locked the flat after putting his mother on a bed because he needed to visit his own apartment, five minutes away, for a change of clothes and a shower. “I could not have left the door open with my mother inside,” Sinha said.“The attendant who looked after her for two months at the hospital had agreed to stay with her at the flat. I asked her to collect her clothes and other stuff from her home (in Garia) and reach the flat later in the day. After placing my mother on a bed, I locked the flat from outside and came to my home. I had alerted the landlord’s father before leaving the flat,” he said.He got a call from the landlord and rushed back to see “a crowd” outside the flat. “The mob would hear nothing. They had one demand — that I shift my mother out. When I finally sought 48 hours, a woman said they would not give me even 48 minutes,” Sinha told Metro.He said he had called up the councillor        for help “but in vain”. “I had to relent because the crowd was turning more aggressive every minute,” he said.",2020-05-17 22:06:00
576,Monalisa Chaudhuri,‘Learnt of father’s death by chance’ says daughter of a coronavirus patient who died on saturday - Telegraph India,"The family of a 74-year-old Covid-19 patient who died at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on Friday said they came to know of the death only on Saturday, when they called on the landline number of the ward after his mobile phone kept ringing.The bereaved family alleged that this was not the only instance of communication gap or harassment.The Telegraph spoke to the daughter of the north Calcutta resident, who complained of lack of empathy and listed her grievances.Not informed of deathThe daughter: When I called the landline number of the ward (at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital), the person who responded said my father had passed away the day before. The last time I had spoken with him, he seemed fine. No one bothered to let us know when his condition deteriorated or when he died.Calcutta Medical College and Hospital: The patient’s admission papers did not have the phone number of any family member, an official of the hospital said. “The number of the ward master’s office at MR Bangur Hospital (from where he had been shifted) was mentioned in the admission papers. The hospital administration called up the ward master,” said the official.“We managed to collect the family’s contact from the ward master after some time. Even the personnel at MR Bangur Hospital are under immense pressure,” the official said.Contacts not passed onThe daughter: I had shared my mobile number and our landline number with MR Bangur Hospital at the time of my father’s admission.MR Bangur Hospital: No one at the hospital could say why the contact details were not passed on to the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, when the patient was shifted. “What happened is really unfortunate but I will not comment why and how this happened because I am unaware of this particular case,” said Sisir Naskar, the medical superintendent of MR Bangur.Shift consent not sought The daughter: We only received a call that the patient was getting shifted. We were told, not asked, before my father was shifted.MR Bangur: A senior official said the patient’s family is usually called to accompany the patient at the time of shift. “But if family members are quarantined, their consent is sought over the phone. Maybe there was a communication gap in this case,” he said.No help at police stationThe daughter: My father had multiple health issues for which he needed medicines. As we were in home quarantine, I called up Shyampukur police station, requesting for help to take the medicines and a phone from our home to the hospital. The officer, who did not introduce himself, refused to help.Shyampukur police station: Shyampukur OC Asish Das said they did not receive any such call. “The family was reluctant to get the patient admitted and wanted to treat him at home. We had learned from residents of the area that he had several symptoms and requested them to get him hospitalised at once. Maybe, that is why they are making false allegations,” Das saidThe daughter refuted the charge. Minister saysMinister of state for health Chandrima Bhattacharya told The Telegraph this was an unfortunate incident and more emphasis would be laid on improving communication between the hospitals and patients’ families.“(After this incident) We have made it a rule that at least one contact number of a family member must be noted in the admission papers,”a  senior official of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital said.",2020-05-17 22:15:00
577,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Neighbours put up ‘barricade’ around house - Telegraph India,"A doctor who tested positive for Covid-19 last week and decided to stay in home isolation because she had mild symptoms alleged that the local civic body and some residents of the area had been pressuring her to get admitted to hospital and some people had put up a barricade in front of her house. The doctor attached to Peerless Hospital said her husband, who is also a doctor with another private hospital, has been facing problems from his doctor colleagues.The woman, who stays in the Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality area, had tested positive for Covid-19 last Tuesday. “Since I had almost no symptoms, I decided to stay in home isolation. Being a doctor, I will be able to analyse my health conditions and I know the rules of isolation. Besides, a government health official is calling me up every day to monitor my condition,” she said on Sunday.Some civic officials allegedly called her up on the first two days of isolation and insisted that she get get admitted to a hospital.“One of them told me that since I was a doctor with Peerless Hospital, I could get admitted there,” the doctor said. She alleged that some neighbours had also called her up, asking her to get admitted to a hospital.Ajoy Krishna Sarkar, physician and in-charge of Peerless Hospital’s intensive therapy unit, intervened and sought police help.The doctor couple’s home was allegedly barricaded with bamboo poles on Saturday. “I called the police and the municipality and they were surprised. Neither had set up the barricade. Later, it was revealed that some residents had put it up. The poles were removed,” she said.The ministry of health and family welfare had last month issued guidelines, stating that pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients or those with very mild symptoms can stay in home isolation provided they follow norms such as wearing a triple-layer mask, stay in one room, away from other people at home, specially the elderly, and not share personal items with other people.“My husband and son, who is 11, are staying in other rooms. My in-laws live in the same building but in a separate flat. I am not going out and the local councillor has arranged for all our daily supplies,” she said. The doctor said one of her colleagues at Peerless had faced similar problems when she tested positive for the coronavirus. “I had thought people would slowly become more empathetic. But my personal experience is that there is lack of awareness,” she said.Residents of the area where the doctor couple live have also submitted a petition to the local councillor, demanding that the road in front of their house be blocked.“They have been calling me up every day and asking why the doctor was not sent to the hospital,” said Nitu Das, the Trinamul councillor of ward 31 of Rajpur-Sonarpur Municipality. “I have been visiting neighbourhoods, trying to prevent panic and rumours but it’s an impossible task.”When a nurse of a private hospital tested positive in the area, residents had drawn up a list of five to six other nurses staying in the area, the councillor said. “They came to me with the list and wanted the nurses to leave. But I resisted the pressure.”Sarkar, the doctor’s colleague who helped her, said such behaviour was unfortunate. “She never refused to treat patients after the outbreak of Covid-19, But if doctors like her become social outcast, then other doctors will be scared to treat patients,” Sarkar said.A resident of the area said they were concerned about safety. “We have nothing against her, but there are vendors going to their house every day and the chance of Covid-19 spreading in our area becomes higher. So we are concerned and want the road to be blocked.”",2020-05-17 22:26:00

He thought many are still unfed and wanted to help through our initiative.”Anindita, who completed her master’s from Presidency last year, opened the bag to find a collection of coins and a few crumpled notes that added up to around Rs 500.Quarantined Student-Youth Network — the group of present and former students of Presidency University and other institutions — have been feeding the poor in pockets of North 24-Parganas. But donations have started drying up because of an unprecedented slump in business.“All is not lost,” said Anindita, who lives across the lane from Mriganka’s home in in Naba Palli off Jessore Road in Habra. “It has given us a new lease of life. If he can go the extra mile, why can’t we?”Arkopal Dutta, a batch mate of Anindita, said: “We hope the story of Mriganka would inspire more to step forward.”",2020-05-17 22:40:00
579,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Fear, transport, viability keep clinics shut in Kolkata - Telegraph India","Several clinics and diagnostic facilities in the heart of the city are still shut and a few are planning to open from Monday but only for emergency patients.Fear among some doctors of getting infected by Covid-19, problems faced by some employees in reaching the clinics because of the lockdown and apprehensions that it might not be possible to ensure social distancing are some of the reasons why clinics are shut.The clinics are important for patients who do not need to go all the way to hospital for consultation with doctors, follow-ups and small emergencies and procedures such as tooth extraction.But many clinics run by private hospitals, which have been closed since the lockdown was enforced in the last week of March, are yet to open.Fortis Medical Centre on Sarat Bose Road near Minto Park, among others, will reopen on Monday, according to officials. But only emergency cases will be handled for the time being, they said.“We had a meeting with senior doctors last Wednesday. They urged us to resume operations. Accordingly, we have made arrangements but we will try to avoid routine cases and treat only emergency ones,” Gurvinder Singh, facility director of Fortis Medical Centre, said. The clinic is run by the Fortis Hospital and Kidney Institute.Singh said doctors would not be able to see patients at a stretch for more than two hours after wearing personal protective equipment.The centre has ophthalmology and dentistry units. Doctors have to be close to patients to examine them. Officials said many doctors would be apprehensive about checking patients.At Bengal Oncology Center near Deshapriya Park in south Calcutta, doctors are apprehensive that they would not be able to maintain social distancing norms in the small space.“Ideally, now a patient should be accompanied by one person. But in case of cancer patients, four to five people accompany one patient, given their critical condition. It could be difficult to enforce social distancing norms,” Gautam Mukhopadhyay, surgical oncologist and director, Bengal Oncology Centre, said.The centre has a footfall of 80-100 people every day.Others said viability, too, was a problem, along with the matter of employees being unable to reach the clinic for want of transport.At RN Tagore Lansdowne Clinic on Sarat Bose Road, the daily footfall used to be 50. “Now, because of social distancing and given the small space of the clinic, we can have barely 10 patients… so, it will not be viable at the moment,” R. Venkatesh, director, eastern region, Narayana Health, which runs the clinic, said. “Now, we are focusing on our hospitals and patients can come to the OPD.”",2020-05-17 23:19:00

We have identified community halls, clubs and schools as shelters,” said a CMC official. “We will also urge people living on pavements to shift.” He said more than 200 CMC schools and over 100 community halls could be used as shelters. People in the shelters will be asked to maintain physical distancing and wear masks. Another CMC official said 16 teams, one in each borough, would be deployed to remove branches and uprooted trees from roads. Besides, there will be two central teams. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority, too, has kept teams ready to clear roads of uprooted trees. Officials have checked all pumps in the storm water drainage pumping stations and a number of extra pumps have been kept as back-up.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has opened a disaster management cell. There, too, removing branches will be a priority. Special teams will be deployed at all borough offices and pumping stations in Salt Lake, Kestopur and Rajarhat. Several schools in Salt Lake, Rajarhat, Baguiati and Kestopur have been earmarked as storm shelters. A Howrah Municipal Corporation official said people can reach out to them via their Twitter handle and Facebook page.",2020-05-18 21:20:00
581,Monalisa Chaudhuri, Coronavirus Lockdown: SSKM ‘Covid-19 suspect horror’ - Telegraph India,"A middle-aged cardiac patient who fell off his bed at SSKM Hospital and suffered multiple injuries was allegedly left unattended on the floor amid blood for an hour till his son came and lifted him up on Sunday morning.The reason for the alleged negligence: Deb Kumar Mukherjee, 57, was a “Covid-19 suspect”.Mukherjee, who had been admitted to the ICU of the cardiology department, was shifted to a general ward on Thursday after another patient in the ICU tested positive for Covid-19 and the unit had to be vacated for sanitisation.Since then, his only son Jeet, who works at a private company, has been his lone attendant in the hospital because “no employee in the general ward will touch him”, the family said.On Sunday morning, Jeet received a call shortly after he had left the hospital to freshen up – the only time of the day he takes a break from his father’s bedside – asking him to return to lift his father to the bed.“The nurse who had called scolded me for leaving the hospital. She said the patient had fallen and they were not going to lift him to the bed,” said Jeet, a resident of Behala.He rushed back to the ward and found his father still sitting on the floor, bleeding from his head, elbow and nose. Around an hour had passed since the nurse had called him up.SSKM medical superintendent Raghunath Mishra said: “This should not have happened. I will check and take action if the allegations are true.”Hospital staff later attended to his injuries.Krishna Sau, 64, another heart patient who was shifted to the general ward the same day, recounted to Metro over the phone how Mukherjee was “crying like a baby” after falling off the bed.Sau, too, said he had only his two sons to take care of him at the hospital.A doctor at SSKM said they had planned to place each ward under the supervision of “one medical staff or attendant” who will take care of the patients wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).Family members of Sau and Mukherjee said a PPE-clad employee would visit the ward thrice a day to distribute medicines. He allegedly hands over the medicines to relatives at the entrance of the ward. The doctor added: “Given their limited knowledge…. handling a Covid-19 patient is a stigma for Group D staff.” Jeet said he paid a woman at SSKM Rs 200 daily to take care of his father. “Still I would get calls at 3 in the morning asking me to clean my father’s stool,” he said.",2020-05-18 21:35:00
582,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Take us back to school: Traumatised children - Telegraph India,"Children from underprivileged families have been pleading with teachers to resume school and give them respite from the mental, and at times physical, trauma that many of them face at home.Most of these children live in a single room with five or more family members. The fathers of most of these children are daily wage earners,  porters,  van rickshaw pullers, hawkers or drivers and mothers work as domestic help. With the parents out of work and no source of income, domestic violence has been on the rise.  The children are either witness to the violence or victims themselves.The women of the house are often beaten up by their husbands and at times they vent their frustration on the children. Verbal abuse is common, too.Some of the students have told their teachers that the pandemic is a lesser concern for them than having to stay at home. Teachers are trying to explain to them that being at home is important for their own safety.A 16-year-old shared with her teacher how her father beats up her mother because he does not have money to buy alcohol. Calcutta Rescue, an NGO that has two educational centres in the city, has been receiving requests from many girls and boys to reopen the school. “The children want to go to school because it will take them out of the closed environment and into a more safe and happy space. Often, when they come to the centre, the children are able to talk about their anxieties with the teachers,” said Ananya Chatterjee, school administrator at Calcutta Rescue.Even when the children start going to formal schools, they come back to Calcutta Rescue to spend time with the teachers. Chatterjee said the teachers and counsellors have been reaching out to the children during the lockdown.“The urgency to return to school comes from living in an unhealthy space. Most of them witness or experience violence at home. The hours that they spend out of home is an escape from that violence and ambience,” said Manjusmita Bagchi, associate director, Ek Tara, a trust that works with women and children from marginalised communities. Teachers at Ek Tara have received similar requests from mothers, who want a safer space for their girls.“The pressure also builds on the mothers,” said Bagchi. The children at Samaritan Help Mission have also complained of feeling “suffocated at home”.“We have three schools and many of the children have been crying because they have to bear the brunt of their jobless parents’ frustration. They live in 8ft-wide rooms and food is prepared under the bed. They have to live in such homes 24x7 with no outlet,” said Mamoon Akhtar, the founder of Samaritan Help Mission.",2020-05-18 21:54:00
583,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus pandemic: Hire retired nurses: Mamata Banerjee to hospitals - Telegraph India,"Private hospitals that have recently lost many nurses because of the Covid-19 scare can consider appointing retired nurses to tide over the shortage, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday.In this context, Mamata referred to the state government’s decision to hire retired people in various capacities during the Covid-19 crisis.“I have heard many nurses have left private hospitals. About 350 nurses have left. I have asked the chief secretary (Rajiva Sinha) to talk to the hospitals from where nurses have left,” the chief minister said.“Many retired nurses and technicians are now free. Private hospitals can hire them if they appeal to work again. We have employed many retired people.” Officials of several private hospitals in the city said they were trying to plug the gap through various means and taking steps to prevent any further departure. “We are in talks with people who have retired early, paramedics and home-care providers who are out of job now. They can help fill the void created by the departure of so many nurses,” said Alok Roy, the chairman of Medica Superspecialty Hospital. He said those people could work in OPDs and fever clinics so that nurses can devote more time in operating theatres and intensive care units. About one hundred nurses have left Medica, Roy said. An official of AMRI Hospitals said the administration was counselling nurses not to leave. “Eight-one nurses have left our hospital. We are counselling those who have stayed back so that they do not leave. In the last two days, none has left,” said the official. While many hospital administrators said the immediate impact might not be severe as fewer patients are in hospital because of the Covid-19 scare, the situation would worsen once non-Covid-19 patients start getting admitted in increasing numbers. But one official said if most of the nurses who would leave were from the critical care unit, the impact could be immediately felt. Metro reported on Friday that nurses from several states working in various private hospitals in Calcutta had been leaving because of the fear they might contract the novel coronavirus. As many as 185 nurses from Manipur recently left for their home state by bus.Nurses from other states, too, have returned home in large numbers, a number of private hospital officials said.An official of a private hospital said the Bengal government had written to the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India saying it was look-ing for ways to address the problem.Mamata also said the private hospitals could think about employing residents of nearby areas in some basic jobs such as administering saline and giving medicines based on a doctor’s prescription. Those people will be deployed after a seven-day training.“It takes 2 to 2.5 years to train a nurse. The hospitals can employ some local people after giving them a short seven-day training. These people can administer oxygen, saline and give medicines as prescribed by doctors. They can be called helpers, not nurses,” Mamata said.The chief minister stressed that only trained nurses would be on duty in surgery cases.",2020-05-18 22:10:00
584,Jhinuk Mazumdar, Coronavirus Lockdown: St. Xavier’s School to start online classes - Telegraph India,"St Xavier’s Collegiate School has sent a circular to parents on Monday to place an online order for books that will be delivered to them within seven days.The school will start the interactive online classes once the books are distributed.“We are planning to start online classes. Online classes will not be as effective if students do not have books. We have delivered books to the teachers and the students will also get the books within seven days,” said principal Father M. Thamacin Arulappan.Teachers across classes have been preparing study material, which is being uploaded and can be accessed by students with the help of a unique ID and password.In a letter addressed to parents, the principal has said: “Once the textbooks are received, we will let you know about our next step of action that will facilitate the teaching-learning process for our children. In addition to the dissemination of study material we are in the process  of working out a system through online that would help our children learn better during this lockdown.”The school will adopt a multi-pronged approach for online teaching. “We plan to have groups where children can approach the teacher individually if they are not comfortable doing so in a group,” said Melvin D’Souza, senior school academic coordinator. Alsoc (Alumnorum Societas), the St Xavier’s School Old Boys’ Association, is also helping out. “We have formed a committee that is looking at the various platforms for online classes. We will place our suggestions before the school,” said Siddhant Kaul, honorary secretary of Alsoc.",2020-05-18 22:25:00
585,Chandreyee Ghose, Coronavirus Lockdown: Motivation video from Birla High School - Telegraph India,"The teachers of Birla High School have launched a video on their school website, motivating students to hold on, stay focused and think positive despite the lockdown. The video, just over five minutes long and titled From Your Teachers With Love, features several teachers.Birla High School is not the only one. Around nine teachers of The Future Foundation School recently posted a video on social media, telling students in verse how much they are being missed.“The senior students are worried about their future. Students are getting frustrated that they cannot return to school. So it was important for the teachers to go beyond holding online classes and cheer up the students. Their mental health is as important,” said Loveleen Saigal, the principal of Birla High.Saswati Sarkar, who wrote the poem and edited the video for Future Foundation students, said the idea was to encourage students. “It spreads a message of hope,” said the Bengali teacher.The junior students of Modern High School for Girls have been receiving videos and stories encouraging them to learn at their own pace. “We realise online classes are not possible in every home. The focus is now more on a child’s mental health,” said Devi Kar, the director of Modern High.At Indus Valley World School, teachers are holding interactive sessions with their students to discuss books and other interests beyond studies, said Amita Prasad the director of Indus Valley World School.",2020-05-18 22:35:00
586,TT Bureau, Coronavirus Lockdown: Kashmir leader worried for shawl sellers stuck in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Former Union minister Saifuddin Soz has urged the Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor to ensure that about 6,000 Kashmiri shawl sellers stuck in Bengal can return home.“They explained their hardships but emphasised the most urgent need for transport to return home to Kashmir at the earliest,” the former minister of environment, forests and water resources in the central government said.“I wrote strongly to Shri G.C. Murmu, the Lt Governor of J&K Union Territory, and strongly urged him to ensure transport to about 6,000 Kashmiris now stranded in West Bengal, particularly, in Calcutta.”Soz, a Congress leader,  named two Kashmiris he had spoken to: Haji Mohammad Yaqoob and Firdous Ahmad.Yaqoob, a shawl seller from Srinagar who has been staying with others in a rented accommodation on Elliot Road, told Metro on Monday that they had spent their savings in booking air tickets in the third week of March. But flights did not take off and they are still to get any refund. “We have to book a ticket on the AC train. But we don’t have money and we don’t know what will happen to us. We are somehow surviving, but don’t know how we can continue.” Firdous Ahmad, 59, from Srinagar, is now cooped in a small Central Avenue accommodation. “We don’t have any money left. We are looking forward to support from the Jammu and Kashmir administration.”There are many like Yaqoob and Ahmad. Metro had on May 17 reported about Arif Ahmad Lone and Mohammad Umar, from Budgam district, who are now living in Baghajatin.The sellers are now looking for a bus. They have got in touch with a tour operator in Park Circus. “We want to board the bus to Jammu somehow and reach home. The trains will be of no use,” Lone said.A large group from Maheshtala has succeeded the bus way. “We paid Rs 1.8 lakh to a bus operator,” Farooq Ahmed, one of the bus  passengers, told The Telegraph over phone.The bus had reached Jammu on Monday evening.Lone said on Monday evening that he had managed to gather money to book a train ticket with the help of a charitable organisation. “I am waking up early so I can book a ticket whenever the booking window opens at 8am. But over the past four days I have found that the slots close within 5 minutes of opening, long before our turn comes.”One more Covid-19 hospitalA Covid-19 hospital will be started at KPC Medical College and Hospital, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday.A portion of the campus will be turned into a Covid hospital without hampering the functioning of other departments, a hospital official said in the evening.There are five Covid-19 hospitals in the city. These are: MR Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge, an annexe building of AMRI Salt Lake, Beleghata ID Hospital, Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and the New Town campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute.MR Bangur has 1,100 beds, AMRI Salt Lake 51, Beleghata ID 82, Calcutta Medical College 500 and CNCI 192.There can be 200 beds at KPC because the portion that will be converted into a Covid hospital has only that much space, the hospital official said.It is not clear if the hospital will have isolation beds for Covid-19 suspects as well as for those found positive or only for the positive patients. “We are in talks with the health department,” the official said. “We are trying to start the hospital at the earliest.”",2020-05-18 22:44:00
587,Subhankar Chowdhury, Coronavirus Lockdown: CAA activists to aid of migrants in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A group of artists who were associated with the movement against the citizenship matrix has begun selling their artworks online to raise funds to help migrant workers.They have started drawing postcards and sculpting on ceramics and displaying the artworks on the Facebook page of a charitable platform, Gana Tadaroki Udyog, which has been helping migrant workers.Labani has been drawing postcards under the pen name Anakh Samuddur. She is a research scholar at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta, and her area of research is on “migrant workers from Bengal”.The former Jadavpur University student, who occasionally contributes illustrations for People’s Archive for Rural India (PARI), a digital journalism platform, said she had drawn postcards that could be used as bookmarks or desk showpieces.Each item had been priced at Rs 200 and the sale proceeds added to Rs 5,000.The girl from Krishnagore got the idea of using paintings as a tool to raise funds from a member of the platform whom she had met during the protest on Park Circus Maidan against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens.“I don’t pursue painting as a professional. But the plight of the migrant workers moved me. I decided to translate my skill into a tool to raise funds for them… various platforms have been hit hard for want of funds,” she said.Shoumit, a regular at the Park Circus Maidan protest, penned and composed “Quarintine Song” and posted it on YouTube with an appeal for help. It fetched Rs 18,000.Shoumit, who is a scriptwriter by profession, penned and composed the song that speaks of life going topsy-turvy because of the lockdown.“I appealed to all to contribute whatever they had, considering that it was for people who have been left in the lurch,” he said.Labani and he have transferred the money to the bank account of the platform.She has started working on her next set of creations.Prabir Sutar, a sculptor in Behala, got to know of the effort on Facebook and decided to chip in.He has posted his ceramic creations on the platform’s Facebook page. “As a sculptor, this is what we can do to help hapless migrant workers, some of whom have died for want of help,” Sutar said.Both Labani and Sutar said they would deliver their works once the lockdown was lifted.A member of the platform said art as a form of crowdfunding had struck a chord with many. “We have to think of a sustainable model. If a person thinks he/she can buy a piece of art against a contribution, he/she will always feel enthused.”",2020-05-18 22:56:00
588,Kinsuk Basu,"More state buses, few cabs on Calcutta roads  - Telegraph India","Government buses, which were available once every hour till last week, ferried passengers every 40 minutes on Monday morning.The government said more state buses were on the roads to fill the gap created by the absence of private buses.Taxis were few but could be seen on the roads till early evening. Some 350-odd taxis ran in the early part of the day. Operators said the response was good and that there would be more taxis on the roads from Tuesday.A good number of drivers of the city’s 11,000-odd taxis have left Calcutta and several owners said they would themselves drive the taxis because passengers were willing to hail cabs.Some buses on Ultadanga-Salt Lake, Garia-Howrah Station and Dunlop-Ballygunge routes witnessed heavy demand between 9am and 11.30am, a transport department official said. On several routes, conductors had to persuade people not to board buses in excess of the 20-passenger limit set by the government as buses were aplenty.“We tried to bring down the waiting time to around 40 minutes on most routes in the morning and evening so that passengers didn’t have to wait for long at bus stops,” a transport department official said. “The afternoon was a lean period when the frequency was regulated.”On Monday, several hundreds of people (many from the private sector) stepped out of their homes with passes and letters to justify their movement during the lockdown.In some bus depots, cops were present in the morning to prevent possible confrontation between passengers and drivers or conductors, all of who had turned up in protective gear.“No driver carried more than two passengers on the rear seat,” Sambhu Nath Dey of Progressive Taximen's Union. “All passengers and drivers wore masks… only those who had urgent work hailed a cab.”Private bus operators said they hoped the government would take some steps to find a way out of the “fare impasse” so that buses could be on the roads. Most, however, said they were not sure how many trips could be done till 7pm, given the number of people out on the roads on Monday.“Even if a private bus operator was out he will have to calculate how many passengers he was carrying in every trip,” Rahul Chatterjee of the Bus Minibus Samannoy Samity said. “The government obviously will find a way out for private bus operators.”Some private bus operators said they had been calculating throughout the day but couldn’t find a way out of running buses with the existing fare.“The government will have to come up with definite sops for us to bring out buses,” Tapan Bandopadhyay, the secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, said.",2020-05-18 23:03:00
590,Debraj Mitra, Coronavirus Lockdown: ‘Left-back’ grouse as first flight lands at Kolkata Airport - Telegraph India,"A flight from Dhaka landed at the Calcutta airport with 169 passengers on Monday afternoon, the first plane to touch down the city under the second phase of a project to bring back Indians stuck abroad because of the lockdown.The Air India Flight, which carried 33 Indian passengers to Dhaka earlier in the day, came back to land around 12.30pm. The 33 Indians work in Bangladesh.The 180-seater plane had flown with less than full capacity to ensure social distancing.The first passenger came out of the terminal building at 2.10pm and the last at 4pm. Airport officials attributed the delay to health check-ups and immigration clearances following physical distancing norms.“Fifteen passengers were being asked to disembark in each phase. They underwent temperature screening with a thermal gun. Some other parameters were also checked before they proceeded towards immigration counters,” said an official.Many of the returnees were medical students. Most of them, who said they spent the lockdown inside hostels or students’ mess, had one common grouse — their friends from other Indian states had returned much earlier.“Both my sons live in a mess that has several students from Delhi and Mumbai. All of them returned home long ago. It was very frustrating for them to have been left back. They had been constantly pleading with the Indian high commission to get only one response — there was no flight to Calcutta,” said Prodyut Saha, a dentist who lives in Behala.His two sons, Prithvijit, 23, and Promit, 21, study at the Pioneer Dental College in Dhaka’s Baridhara.Ankita Das, in the first-year of the MBBS course at Kumudini Women’s Medical College in Mirzapur, who spent the lockdown there at her hostel, echoed the Saha brothers. “It seemed Bengal was not as important as other Indian states,” said Das, a resident of Sonarpur, on the city’s southern fringes.The first phase of the Vande Bharat Mission, the Union government's repatriation mission, saw Air India operate 64 flights from May 7 to 13 to bring back around 15,000 Indians stranded abroad because of the lockdown forced by Covid-19. The second phase, from May 16 to 22, is to see 30,000 Indians come back from 31 countries on 149 flights, the Centre has said. Bhubaneswar and Gaya had made it to the list of Indian cities the flights would land in but not Calcutta, triggering a blame game between Bengal and the Centre.Repatriating stranded people from Bengal has become a thorny issue with the Centre giving the impression that the state was not keen on facilitating the mission. The Bengal home department stated in no uncertain terms on Friday that the state was keen to bring back its people stuck abroad and made all arrangements. On Saturday, the Bengal administration announced that Calcutta had been included in the list of Indian destinations and the first flight under the mission would come from Bangladesh.The passengers on Monday’s plane were sent to government centres or private hotels — for the compulsory 14-day quarantine period — according to their choices. Saha’s two sons were taken to a hotel in Ballygunge. “Their swab samples will be collected shortly,” he told Metro.",2020-05-18 23:05:00
591,Snehal Sengupta,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal:  advisory for highrise residents of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Residents of highrises have been advised to keep their windows shut and jam their rails using cloth pieces or erasers so they do not slide open when hit by gusty winds to be brought by Cyclone Amphan.Residents have also been advised against using elevators and to keep their cars parked with the handbrake on and slotted into a gear, so all the wheels are locked.Advisories issued by police and urban local bodies list a slew of safety measures that include removal of all potted plants from window ledges, terraces and balconies so that nothing flies off and becomes a missile that can inflict severe damage.The New Town Kolkata Development Authority has urged residents of highrises to keep their elevators parked on the top floor. “That will minimise damage to the elevator equipment  as well as the building,” said an NKDA engineer. The police have advised residents to stock fuel for back-up generator sets, keep saws and cutters handy so that they can be easily accessed if a tree gets uprooted inside the complex and not to touch any dangling wires.The NKDA has also asked residents of highrises to remove all items from shelves that are at a height and can fall. “Oscillation during a storm is necessary as the movement helps transfer load from top to bottom and prevent damage to the structure. The movement doesn’t cause discomfort but can dislodge items on shelves kept at a height,” said an engineer of the New Town authority.Architect Abin Chaudhuri said a storm affects upper floors more than the ones closer to the ground.“At a higher level, there is more open space and winds blow with greater force. At the ground level, the force reduces because the wind gets obstructed. It is very important to ensure that there is no gap in the windows as the high winds can cause them to shatter,” Chaudhuri said.The Met has said winds clocking over 100kmph are likely to blow across Calcutta after Amphan makes landfall between Wednesday afternoon and evening.In Urbana, a housing complex where some towers have 40 floors and some 45, residents have formed a disaster management committee and set up a standard operating procedure to tackle Amphan.“Our gas connections will be turned off and if need be, the power supply will be turned off, too. Our generator sets are on standby,” said a resident who lives on the 33rd floor of the housing complex, around 700m from the Ruby intersection.At South City on Prince Anwar Shah Road, which has 35 floors, residents have been asked to remove flower pots from common areas and keep their mobile phones charged, torches handy and doors and windows closed.At Rosedale Garden, near Karigori Bhavan in New Town, where each tower has 25 floors, residents have been asked not to touch any electric poles and wires.“Residents have been asked to safely stow away anything that can become a projectile during the cyclone,” said a member of the residents’ association.   A senior police officer said the residents have been advised to call 100 in case of any emergency.",2020-05-19 23:26:00

On the list there is only one flight allotted to Calcutta, which will arrive from Yangon in Myanmar on May 29. The same day, a flight each from Mumbai and Bhubaneswar will land in Calcutta, bringing stranded Indians who will reach those two cities from abroad. “People from Bengal who are stranded in Mumbai and Bhubaneswar will not be allowed to board these flights,” said an official of the civil aviation ministry.Metro has reported that Calcutta had no flights in the first phase of the Vande Bharat mission to bring back stranded Indians. In the second phase, a flight from Dhaka landed in Calcutta on May 18 with 169 Indians stranded in Bangladesh.In what ministry officials called an “extended” second phase, most flights from cities around the world are being brought to Delhi and Mumbai and from there passengers are being connected to other Indian cities.“We had expected a few more flights for Calcutta. At least connecting flights from Delhi and Mumbai would have helped. But there is only one international flight, from Yangon, and two connecting ones from Mumbai and Bhubaneswar,” said a state government official.Calcuttans stuck abroad are desperately contacting Indian missions and the civil aviation ministry but are being asked to wait.“We understand your concerns. Please note that these evacuation flights are planned in phased manner, hence each and every applicant or country may not be covered initially,' stated a reply from the external affairs ministry to Vikram Tejwani from Calcutta, who is stranded in the UK. 'You are advised to remain in contact with our embassy/consulate for further information.”Calcutta Mubashik Aslam, who studies at Tver State Medical University in Russia, said: “The Covid-19 situation in Russia is bad.

Robin Das, 40, was attacked with iron pipes and bamboo sticks lying at a construction site inside the hospital compound, a senior office of Bowbazar police station said.Das was taken to the NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. He was not admitted to CMCH because it is a Covid hospital.“We could gather information that the victim had apparently cheated a patient’s family earlier last week. One of them (a family member) spotted Das and confronted him. The caretaker has said Das had cheated him, too,” said an officer of Bowbazar police station.Das had allegedly taken money from the family on several occasions to deliver medicines inside the ward, which he allegedly never did, the accused family member has told the police.The two main accused, who allegedly led the attack, have been identified as Susanta Mandal, a family member, and caretaker Gopal Maity.The third accused, police said, was neither related to the patient nor to the caretaker. Investigators said they were yet to find out his motive behind the attack.There have been multiple incidents where ward boys, medical staff and touts pretending as medical staff have extorted money from patients’ families, making false promises that they would take care of the patient in the families’ absence or help deliver food and medicines supplied by the family. However, officers could not recall any incident in the recent past where a patient’s family member had taken on an alleged cheat.Metro reported on Tuesday how a heart patient who fell off his bed at SSKM Hospital was allegedly left unattended in a pool of blood for more than an hour, forcing his son to rush from home and lift him back on the bed. The son had alleged that he had paid three people in the hospital — two ward boys and a woman attendant — but his father was left uncared for.",2020-05-19 23:36:00

595,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Shelters for residents of damaged buildings in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The civic administration and the police will conduct a mic campaign on Wednesday to try and convince people living in dilapidated structures and shanties to move to designated shelters.During a video conference on Tuesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee asked Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, to persuade all residents of dilapidated buildings to shift to shelters.Teams have been deployed in different parts of the city to remove fallen branches, uprooted trees or toppled lamp posts and rescue people from under the debris of buildings.A large number of officials and engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will be stationed in office between Wednesday and Thursday morning, when the effect of Cyclone Amphan is likely to be felt in Calcutta and its neighbouring cities. The CMC has issued an advisory to builders to ensure there are no loose ends in scaffoldings and labourers do not work on upper floors or in exposed parts of a proj-ect. “Cranes must be properly secured,” a CMC official said.Each borough in Calcutta will have a team to remove uprooted trees and poles. Besides, there will be two central teams. The city police, too, are keeping five or six teams ready to cut trees and rescue people from under collapsed houses.The police will also have a fleet of rescue boats that will have two life savers each.Officials said portable pumps have been kept in low-lying and waterlogging-prone areas. “We have kept 290 portable pumps ready,” said a CMC official.",2020-05-19 23:39:00
596,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Lockdown: Allegation: 3 anaesthetists refused to help child - Telegraph India,"A six-year-old boy with a ruptured cornea was allegedly refused by three anaesthetists in and around the city last week.A doctor at an ophthalmology hospital in Dankuni, Hooghly, was finally able to operate on the boy on Friday.“I called three anaesthetists because the boy would need general anaesthesia for the surgery. But all of them refused because of the Covid-19 situation,” said Tanushree Chakraborty, one of the directors at  Drishtideep Eye Institute in Dankuni, who along with another surgeon performed the surgery. Chakraborty said the boy was at risk of losing vision in his left eye if the surgery was not conducted in time.Anideep Mondal, 6, was flying a kite at his Burdwan home on May 13 afternoon when he hurt his eye. “He was trying to pull the kite string and one of the sharp edges of the broomstick hit his left eye,” said the boy’s father Ashit, who runs a mobile recharge store in Burdwan. Anideep was taken to a local ophthalmologist, who examined the boy and said the cornea of his left eye was damaged and needed surgery.“The doctor referred us to the Dankuni hospital,” said the father.The father and son travelled around 80km on May 14 to reach Dankuni.“The vision in the boy’s left eye had deteriorated by the time he came to our hospital. It had dropped to only perception of light,” Chakraborty said.“The boy was in danger of losing his vision if the surgery was not done quickly. When I saw the anaesthetists were reluctant, I called up a couple of eye hospitals in Calcutta to ask whether they would do the surgery. But they also refused because doctors were not available,” Chakraborty said.The doctor finally requested anaesthetist Supratim Banerjee, explaining the emergency, and he finally agreed. “As doctors, we have to take the risk of performing surgeries. It’s true that in an eye surgery, a doctor has to be very close to the patient. But we wear personal protective equipment that minimises the risk of infection,” said Chakraborty.Procedures that generate artificial aerosols, including general anaesthesia, are high- risk for healthcare personnel, who can contract Covid-19 if the patient is infected. But such procedures are being carried out across the world taking preventive measures such as wearing PPE. “The doctors at the hospital told us there was a delay in surgery because they were not getting an anaesthetist. But we didn’t know where to go and requested them to somehow arrange for a doctor,” said Anideep’s father.Metro has published several reports on how some doctors have been reluctant to treat patients because of the Covid-19 pandemic.",2020-05-19 23:39:00
597,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Bengal power firms on toes - Telegraph India,"A CESC official has expressed the hope that underground cables will protect power supply its coverage area in the city during the storm but added that the main concern revolved around snapped branches and uprooted trees damaging electric poles.“We have deployed more than 5,000 workers to expedite restoration of snapped services, Avijit Ghosh, vice-president (distribution services) of  CESC, said on Tuesday.Social media is abuzz with suggestions to keep gadgets and electronic appliances switched off during the storm. But Ghosh said there was no danger to them because of the storm. “These things can get damaged by lightnings, not strong winds,” he said.The power utility caters to Calcutta and several neighbouring districts. “Entire Calcutta and and 50 per cent of the rest of the areas have underground cables,” said an official.Power utilities are banking on close coordination with civic bodies to respond to any emergency triggered by Amphan. The storm is expected to generate windspeeds of 50kmph since morning. The speed is gradually expected to go up, clocking 100kmph towards the afternoon, as the storm nears land.The CESC will be “in constant coordination” with the CMC and other civic bodies to ensure quick response in case of any emergency. “To expedite restoration of snapped services, we have deployed more than 5,000 workers,” said Ghosh.Area-specific call centres, more people on the ground and automated alternate feeds for hospitals and pumping stations in the city are some of the steps being taken by the utilities gearing up for Amphan in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis.“We usually operate a centralised call centre during natural calamities. But this time, we will have an emergency control centre at BBD Bag and operate 10 additional area-specific call centres. This will enable us to have more people addressing emergency issues without compromising with the social-distancing norms,” said another official of the CESC.The CESC call centre numbers are 1912/44031912/18605001912.Grappling with the Covid-19 curbs, many offices and commercial establishments in the city are still shut and the employees are working from home. The additional call centres are also in anticipation of more calls from across the city, the official said.The demand has largely been domestic in the wake of the curbs, said sources in the utility.The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, the state-run distribution utility, has promised “maintenance personnel across the state and transformers and diesel gensets at all divisions”.During a squall in April 2018, that clocked wind speeds of over 90kmph, the CESC had received more than 36,000 fault calls and the WBSEDCL lost 300 electricity poles.Hospitals and drainage pumping stations of the civic body will have an automated alternate feed in case the primary supply snaps, said Ghosh of the CESC.“The WBSEDCL will also have back-up supply for hospitals in its areas,” said Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, the power minister. ",2020-05-19 23:40:00
598,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus case brake on Chittaranjan Seva Sadan and Sishu Sadan Hospital - Telegraph India,"Chittaranjan Seva Sadan and Shishu Sadan Hospital, a government-run mother-and-child hospital, temporarily stopped admissions from Tuesday after three pregnant women, who were patients, and one nurse tested positive for Covid-19, officials said.Till now, 13 persons, including a nurse, have tested positive in the hospital. The authorities of the hospital said the building needed to be evacuated for sanitisation.“Seven persons tested positive (for Covid-19) in the last four days. The total figure is 13. We have temporarily stopped admissions. It will take us some time to shift the patients to other hospitals and get the entire hospital thoroughly sanitised,” the medical superintendent of the hospital, Asish Mukhopadhyay, told Metro.The emergency section of the hospital, however, will continue to operate, said the official.There are 38 patients whom the authorities of the Chittaranjan Seva Sadan and Shishu Sadan Hospital are in the process of shifting to other hospitals. Sources in the health department said the patients would be shifted to two hospitals in the city.“The sanitisation process may take us about five days. We will let people know if the work is completed earlier,” Mukhopadhyay said.The nurse and 12 pregnant women who tested positive for Covid-19 have been admitted to MR Bangur Hospital and the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. Earlier, several government and private hospitals had to stop admissions or shut down sections of the healthcare units after patients, doctors and nurses had tested positive for Covid-19 and a number of nurses and doctors had to be quarantined.All three hospitals have resumed normal operations.The Chittaranjan Seva Sadan and Sishu Sadan is one of the biggest government maternity hospitals in the state that caters to patients from across the city and the outskirts.A doctor said the temporary closure of admissions would create inconvenience to a lot of pregnant women who cannot afford private hospitals. “But for the safety and security of all patients, doctors and medical staff, this is the best possible option,” the doctor said.",2020-05-19 23:41:00
599,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Social boycott over travel in Subhasgram - Telegraph India,"A woman has been socially boycotted by her neighbours in Subhasgram, South 24-Parganas, after she returned from Pushkar in Rajasthan’s Ajmer and stayed in home quarantine and tested negative for Covid-19, she has alleged.The 34-year-old woman had returned from Pushkar on May 5, along with 1,100 others, after being stranded there because of the lockdown. Two days later, she visited the state-run hospital in Mullickpur for a Covid-19 test, she said.On Tuesday, she completed her 14-day quarantine period but she said she would continue staying indoors rather than “getting ostracised for life”.Her neighbours have apparently tried to stop the supply of drinking water and vegetables to her but “winning their trust is as important”.Subhasgram, about 25km from Calcutta, is a part of the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency with a rural population of close to 68 per cent.Supply of drinking water in the area means buying packaged water bottles from shops. That has been the way of life for decades after the groundwater was found to be contaminated with arsenic.The woman, who lost her father a year ago, lived with her mother. They used to get water supplied from a nearby shop, she said. At times, when she used to return late from work (as a help in Dhakuria), neighbours would get vegetables delivered to her home from the shop, she said.She dropped her mother at her brother’s house in Raidighi before leaving for Pushkar to perform her father’s last rites. After returning, she pulled through the first two days by boiling water and eating whatever was left at home, she said.“Things changed when people saw me going to the hospital in a car. The hospital authorities had sent the car so that I could go there and get myself tested. The car dropped me off after the test,” the woman said. “The next day when I called the shop for a bottle of packaged water, neighbours started saying I was Covid positive. I had asked a kid to get me some vegetables. Her parents thrashed her for speaking to me.” The woman said it was challenging to live alone in these times and that the fight to convince neighbours she was not Covid positive was “unbearable”.“I kept telling some of my neighbours over phone that I had tested negative… would the doctors at the hospital allowed me to stay at home if I had tested positive, I asked them.  “Some kept saying the car had been sent by police and not by the hospital because I had tested positive. All sorts of stories are doing the rounds.”A few of the neighbours who buy packaged water bottles from the same shop has demanded that her bottle have her name so that “it does not get mixed up with others”. A few stop by her house to see a “positive patient”, she said. “I don’t know how long I have to hear ‘tomar corona hoyechhey (you have the coronavirus)’.”",2020-05-19 23:42:00
600,TT Bureau,Coronavirus Lockdown: Auto operators in Calcutta keen to double fares - Telegraph India,"Auto owners and drivers want to recover the fare of four passengers from two when services resume on May 27 but union leaders are unsure if the government will allow it.The government has said autos can ply in the city but with only two passengers seated in the rear.  Auto unions held multiple meetings on Tuesday to discuss the matter where owners and drivers said raising fares was the only option.Debraj Ghosh, a union leader on the Gariahat-Garia route, said the fare for the entire trip was Rs 17 before the lockdown. “It came to Rs 68 with four passengers. The owners have said they cannot settle for anything less than that from one trip.”Private bus fares are regulated by the government but auto fares are decided by unions. Private buses are not running because the government has ruled out a fare hike. The government has set a 20-passenger limit for buses.“Auto fares are very high on most routes. If the fares are doubled, it will be unbearable for many. I think the government should intervene,” said a man who works in an essential services sector and has to go to office every day.Several union leaders fear a government clampdown if fares were to increase. “We will meet senior leaders to voice the concerns of auto owners,” a leader of the Trinamul-affiliated trade union said.Police said cops would meet auto union leaders after Cyclone Amphan passes. “We are now focussed on taking preventive measures against the cyclone and staying ready for rescue operations. We will meet auto union leaders once this is over,” an officer said.",2020-05-19 23:44:00
601,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus Lockdown: Stalls across Calcutta to be numbered for odd-even initiative - Telegraph India,"Hawkers will number their shops to adopt the odd-and-even formula for reopening from May 27, as suggested by the chief minister.Hawkers’ union leaders met on Tuesday and decided on preventive steps to take for opening their shops. “We will paint numbers in front of the stalls so that hawkers know which are odd-numbered and which even-numbered,” said Shaktiman Ghosh, the leader of Hawker Sangram Committee. The hawkers will also put a thread or rope in front of their stalls so that customers do not come too close to the seller, Ghosh said. That could mean occupying more pavement  space. The union also plans to draw lines so that there is distance between two buyers. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday that hawkers would be able to open their stalls from May 27 but suggested that they adopt the odd-and-even formula and open on alternate days to maintain safe distance. Corporation officials said they would meet hawkers’ unions after a couple of days. “Right now, our primary focus is on mitigating the impact of Cyclone Amphan. We will plan the reopening of hawkers’ stalls from Thursday,” an official said.The numbering would also give an idea of the total number of hawkers in a particular area, a task that has been pending for a long time in the city. Ghosh said there were about 2.75 lakh hawkers stalls in Calcutta. Union leaders said there were about 5,000 hawkers in and around Gariahat —between Ballygunge and Deshapriya Park and Golpark and Pantaloons and about 2,500 hawkers in Hatibagan — between Star Theatre and Shyambazar, along Bidhan Sarani. Several Calcuttans said following distancing norms on pavements would be impossible once hawkers’ stalls are opened. “The hawkers have occupied more than half of the width of pavements in most places. If hawkers and customers maintain distance, there will be no space for anyone to walk on the pavement,” said a Gariahat resident. “The government should issue detailed guidelines before allowing hawkers to resume business.”",2020-05-19 23:45:00

Even towering cranes that are used to load/unload goods have been secured to prevent them from snapping when the cyclone strikes.Emergency control rooms have been set up at Sagar Island and at Haldia for round-the-clock monitoring.Around the time the vessels were asked to move into the deep sea, railway officials got the wheels of several trains in the sheds at Howrah and Shalimar chained to the tracks to prevent them from rolling because of high-velocity winds.The railways has kept an emergency team ready at the Howrah and Shalimar sheds.  “The Haldia dock was shut down from 10pm on Tuesday and operations will resume on Thursday after assessment. The Calcutta port will be shut down from Wednesday morning,” a port trust official said.At Budge Budge and Haldia, oil jetties were cleared of ships and officials were asked to take ensure necessary steps in the wake of the cyclone.",2020-05-19 23:46:00

The government has decided to subdivide the two zones to ease restrictions in places within the zones that have not been hit by the coronavirus, a civic official said.“No passes or permission will be needed to open shops outside affected zones. They will have to follow the basic rules of distancing and the restrictions on the number of customers, apart from the directives on staff strength mentioned in the government order,” Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, joint commissioner (headquarters), said.Affected zones are places that have reported Covid-19 patients. A buffer zone is immediately outside an affected zone and a clean zone is a place, which has not reported any Covid-19 patients.Once a list of affected, buffer and clean zones has been created, it will be uploaded on the CMC’s website, a civic official said.Government guidelines have said shop owners will have to ensure not more than five people can enter a shop at a time and that they maintain a distance of at least 6ft among themselves.There was confusion among some traders if they could open shops after checking the list or if some permission was needed.“We need an official intimation from the CMC, allowing us to open the market…. After we receive official communication, we will approach the police and try to clarify other points… such as if we have to follow the odd/even rule for opening shops,” Asraf Ali, joint secretary of the SS Hogg Market Traders association, said.A few standalone shops in the Jadavpur-Baghajatin area have started operations but there is no instruction if all shops can open simultaneously, an officer of Jadavpur police station said.There is no specific embargo on opening shops outside affected zones, an officer in Lalbazar said.It is mandatory for shop owners to use masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. Shops can operate with a staff strength of either 50 per cent or 25 per cent depending on their locations, according to the government guidelines.",2020-05-19 23:46:00
604,TT Bureau,"Amphan ravaged city, corridors flooded, look like a dark reptile  - Telegraph India","Calcutta's waterlogged roads looked like a dark and slithering reptile on Wednesday night as howling winds continued to haunt the city's deserted, Amphan-ravaged corridors.Snapped power lines left many parts of the city without electricity, and the utilities got overwhelmed by distress calls.Phone lines were down and even the generally reliable Wi-Fi at home could no longer be trusted.Calcutta had not in decades heard anything like the roar of Wednesday's winds nor seen anything like its toppling power.Portions of at least 10 buildings collapsed but fortunately there were no casualties.Neither police nor the |civic bodies had an estimate of how many trees had fallen. 'Many, many,' officials |kept saying. Teams with electric saws and fluorescent jackets were everywhere, yet too few.At least 200 electric poles and 200 trees were uprooted in the Calcutta municipal area alone, said one official.He immediately added: 'It's a very rough estimate as the storm is yet to leave the city. We are still assessing the damage. It will take till |Thursday morning to know the real extent of the destruction.'Nearly 500 trees fell in Salt Lake and many more tumbled in parts of Rajarhat, along VIP Road and Kaikhali.When the power lines came back to life, there was a new problem: iron gates |and other objects got electrified at several places from |cables that lay deep under water.People got a scare in Salt Lake's EE block when a lamppost that had collapsed on a waterlogged street along with live wires flickered back to life as power was restored.Large parts of Kasba, Dum Dum, Salt Lake, Baranagar, Ballygunge, Jadavpur, Jodhpur Park, Behala and many other places were plunged into darkness late into Wednesday night.Drinking water was a big worry across electricity-less households, as was the threat of mobile phones going dead.The Met office at Alipore recorded 222mm of rain till 8.30pm. Dum Dum had received 194mm.Calcutta's drainage system is designed to squirt out 6mm water in an hour. 'So, if it rains more than 6mm an hour, water-logging is inevitable,' said a civic engineer.He said the civic body was trying to drain out the water faster by operating extra pumps in low-lying areas and running all the pumps at the pumping stations.The water-logging has deepened concerns about drinking water at a time the city is in the grip of a pandemic.Over 6,000 people across Calcutta have been relocated to school buildings and civic community centres that had been converted into storm shelters.If the Covid-19 scare had largely brought out the ugly neighbour in the Calcuttan, the cyclone did the city one good turn: people came together in many localities to fight its ravages.If people were trying to plug a hole to prevent water from seeping into a neighbour's house at one place, at another they were collectively trying to drain water out of an inundated pump room or helping a car owner without a driver find a safe corner for his vehicle.Many cars needed new safe spots because of flooded basement parking lots and falling trees.The Park hotel said its swimming pool was overflowing and the roof of its lift room had been blown away.",2020-05-20 21:59:00

Most of the people shifted earlier in the day were from north and central Calcutta where the number of old and dilapidated structures is more.The evacuees were handed over masks while entering the shelters. Civic personnel sanitised the shelters with sodium hypochlorite solution before letting people inside.In most places, the evacuees were provided with mattresses. They were asked to follow distancing rules. “When police and civic personnel approached us in the morning, we readily agreed to shift to the shelters,” a pavement dweller from north Calcutta said.“We have shifted many people since morning as a preventive measure. These were mainly those living on footpaths and in dilapidated structures,” a CMC official said. More shelters have been kept ready. “People living in places prone to waterlogging, especially those living in slums in such areas, may need to be shifted in case of heavy rain.”The main objective is to save lives, which is why people were shifted to the shelters before the cyclone struck, the official said.Asim Ghosh, the coordinator and former councillor of Ward 7, told Metro that 60 people had been shifted to a community hall, Aikatan, in his ward. “People who lived under a tree or without a permanent shelter had been shifted in the morning. In the evening I got distress calls from four families. Some said their overhead tin shed had been blown away by the storm,” he said.A family in Bagbazar’s Udbodhan Lane sought help after a tree fell on their hutment.Cooked food had been given to people in the shelters for lunch, a CMC official said. “Large parts are without power supply. We have kept dry food ready for night in case we can’t provide cooked food.”Several councillors said they could not recall the last time when so many people had been evacuated and sent to relief shelters in Calcutta. “This is a large-scale evacuation. Even at night people are being shifted. Those whose houses have been damaged are being shifted at night,” a north Calcutta ward coordinator said.Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators, was present in the civic body’s control room for a long time since afternoon as the cyclone swept across the city.CMC officials and engineers from various departments such as drainage, building, engineering and solid waste management spent the night in their offices.

They said they had not seen “waves like this in the river in many years”.Vessels anchored at Calcutta and Haldia dock kept swaying but Calcutta Port Trust officials said their tethers held firm.“The turbulence in the water kept rising as the wind picked speed,” said a CPT official. “It was a sight.”High mast cranes continued to sway even after they were firmly secured. At the emergency control rooms at Sagar and Haldia officers remained glued to the monitors while sending out warnings at regular intervals.Along the banks of Hooghly, police officers kept making rounds since morning requesting visitors to different ghats to stay away.“By afternoon, all the ghats were empty. As evening set in we could only see the water lashing on the steps of the ghats,” said an officer of North Port Police Station.The river traffic police had kept speed boats ready to move in if there was any call for help. There weren't any.

612,Our Correspondent,NDRF sending four teams to help rebuild Amphan battered Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Four more teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are being sent to Bengal that has borne the brunt of the devastation caused by cyclone Amphan which made landfall at Sagar Island, over 100km from Calcutta on Wednesday.NDRF director-general S.N. Pradhan told the media on Thursday that the teams, being airlifted from Pune and Chennai, would be used to help rebuild the city that has seen thousands of electricity poles and trees uprooted, leading to power outages and severe disruptions in mobile and internet connectivity.'Damage is estimated to be higher in West Bengal. The state has asked for four more teams of NDRF, to assist in  (urban) restoration work. Immediately, the Cabinet Secretary has decided to send the  teams,” said Pradhan.He said that people in high impact areas of West Bengal have been advised to remain in shelters because their homes were destroyed. He also estimated that Bengal might need deployment of NDRF teams for a longer period.Pradhan said Odisha had not reported “heavy damages”. “They [Odisha] estimated that within 24-48 hours, life will return to normal in highly impacted areas,” he said, adding that power services would be restored completely in high impact areas in the next 24 hours.NDRF teams worked through the night, in order to clear roads and restore normalcy as soon as possible - DG, @NDRFHQ #CycloneAmphanUpdate #CycloneAmphan pic.twitter.com/x5tzfzw4bfNearly two lakh people, who were in shelters in Odisha, were now returning to their homes.NDRF teams, Pradhan stressed, had been deployed and started work four days before the cyclone made landfall.Earlier in the day, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a video conference with chief secretaries and their teams of West Bengal and Odisha to estimate the damage and response required.IMD’s Director General of Meteorology Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said the super cyclone Amphan had left West Bengal areas late last (Wednesday) night and crossed over to Bangladesh, moving north and north eastwards.“Initially, the high-impact areas were East Midnapur, North 24 Parganasdistricts and later it moved towards Calcutta, Hooghly and Howrah where we saw a severe impact,” he said.Before reaching Calcutta, Amphan mangled Sagar Island, Kakdwip, Namkhana, Patharpratima, Gosaba and Kultali in South 24-Parganas, Basirhat, Hasnabad, Minakha, Sandeshkhali and Hingalganj in North 24-Parganas, and Nandigram and Haldia in East Midnapore.The highest wind speed of 130 km/hr was recorded at Dum Dum in Calcutta around 7 pm.Mohapatra informed the press that the cyclonic system had weakened and was situated in Bangladesh. However, some impact of the cyclone would be experienced in western Meghalaya and parts of Assam.",2020-05-21 12:51:00
613,Anasuya Basu,Cyclone Amphan: Storm strikes 270-year-old Great Banyan Tree - Telegraph India,"Cyclone Amphan did not spare the 270-year-old Great Banyan Tree in the Indian Botanic Garden in Shibpur, Howrah.Wednesday’s cyclone ravaged its old prop roots leaving a gaping hole in the northwest corner of the tree, which stands over 4.67 acres. The tree is no stranger to cyclones and had lost its main trunk to two cyclones in 1864 and 1867.“It has almost lost its identity as the tree with the biggest canopy,” senior scientist Basant Kumar Singh who reached the garden early to assess the damage said.While cyclones Aila, Phani and Bulbul could do no major damage to this grandad of Shibpur, Cyclone Amphan has torn apart the clonal colony that appears like a dense forest rather than a single tree. The late 19th century cyclones damaged its main trunk and branches, which later led to the amputation of the main trunk in 1925 to keep the rest of the tree healthy.Apart from the most attractive and most visited tree, the 273-acre botanic garden has lost other significant inhabitants. Of its 15,000 trees, more than 1,000 have been damaged and hundreds have been uprooted. “The only fully grown Kalpavriksha or Baobab tree (more than 100 years old) and the Mad Tree got uprooted,” Singh said.The Kalpavriksha was the third most popular and visited tree in the garden after The Great Banyan Tree and The Double Coconut Tree. It is so named because of its gigantic shape. Hindus worship the tree as the “tree of heaven” or the “wish-fulfiling tree”. Mad Tree is a species in which no single leaf looks the same.The Mahagony Avenue, where a road in the garden is lined with huge mahogany trees, the Bamboo setum, an area marked with bamboo trees, the Pinatum, a section for various types of pine trees and the Garden Nursery have all been damaged.“Not a single part of the garden seems to have been spared,” garden director Kanak Das said. “Cyclone Amphan has totally devastated the botanic garden. A huge number of trees in almost all the divisions have either been uprooted or broken…. It will take at least four to five days to assess the loss.”",2020-05-21 21:30:00
614,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan rings death knell for Sunderbans amid coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"Rising salinity in water will put tens of thousands of people out of work in the Sunderbans in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan, like it did after Cyclone Aila.But unlike 2009, when Aila struck, affected people do not have the option of migrating to Calcutta or other cities in search of work because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“A reverse migration is taking place because of the novel coronavirus with tens of thousands of people returning to the Sunderbans. The storm is like a death knell for these people, already dependent on government and NGO support,” Sankar Halder, founder of an NGO that works in several blocks of the Sunderbans, said.A survey by the NGO in five of the 29 blocks had revealed that close to 5,000 families were staring at starvation during the lockdown.Winds blowing over 150kmph battered the Sunderbans at the time of Cyclone Amphan’s landfall, leaving a trail of destruction. But the direction of the wind is feared to cause a more lasting damage than the wind.“South to north winds trigger a surge in movement of water from sea to land. The cyclone had winds blowing from south southwest to north northeast. Cyclone Aila had north to south winds, but Amphan being a stronger system, the slightly changed direction of the wind was not a hurdle in seawater inundating land,” a Met official in Delhi said.Bulbul in November 2019 had generated faster winds than Aila, causing large-scale destruction but the direction of the wind was north to south, sparing the delta.The bulk of the river embankment across the Sunderbans has been destroyed by Amphan, aggravating the ingress of saltwater into the land.“Aman (a variety of rice) seeds are sown in June. The stagnant saline water in the farmland will make it impossible this year. The sweet water bodies will be filled with saltwater making them unfit for irrigation,” Chandan Maity, the headmaster of Krishnachandrapur High School in Mathurapur in South 24-Parganas, said.A forest official, who had spent a lot of time in the Sunderbans in the aftermath of Aila, said pumping out saline water from farm and water bodies was a Herculean task that called for proactive government intervention and international funds. “It is likely to take months with the best efforts.”“We have grown used to damaged houses, uprooted trees and dead livestock after storms. We can rebuild houses but saline water is a monster that kills us slowly. Aila happened in 2009; some areas retained saline water for almost three years,” Maity said.",2020-05-21 21:31:00
615,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan: Beast that was not to be tamed - Telegraph India,"Cyclones usually lose steam after making landfall but even a depleted Amphan kept surging through land like a raging bull because of its high wind speed, which peaked at 185kmph during landfall.In addition, the rich deltaic region in the Sunderbans kept feeding Amphan with moisture, helping it stay strong.In Calcutta, the highest wind speed was 133kmph — in Dum Dum at 7.20pm.Amphan reached Bangladesh around 8.30am on Thursday as a deep depression. The system made landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm and it took 18 hours to reduce to a cyclonic storm.The weather in Calcutta started to clear on Thursday and the Met office said it would be clearer on Friday.“The strength of the cyclone depends on the intensity with which it hits the land, which was very high in this case,” said Mrutyanjay Mohapatra, the chief of India Meteorological Department, Delhi.“Imagine a drought — a rich person can survive it with the stock of resources for a longer period than a poor man. Similarly, Amphan was such a strong storm that it had enough steam to keep going with ferocity despite meeting resistance on land.”Amphan had a diameter of 700km at the start of the landfall.Aila had generated a wind speed of 110kmph at landfall in the Sunderbans.After making landfall near Sagar Island, Amphan travelled north and north-east, brushing past the east of Calcutta and moving to Bangladesh through Nadia and Murshidabad.During the landfall, to the right of the cyclone was the Sunderbans and the rest of South 24-Parganas. To its left was Digha in East Midnapore.The wind direction to the right of the cyclone was south to north and to the left, north to south. “The wind speed in the Sunderbans and the rest of South 24-Parganas and North 24-Parganas was 10-20kmph more than Digha,” said a weather official.The peak time of the storm in Calcutta, which is more than 100km from the Sunderbans, was 5.30pm to 9pm.“The cyclone went from the left of the city. When the city recorded the highest wind speed, the left front spiral of the cyclone had brushed the city,” said G.K. Das, director, India Meteorological Department, Calcutta.",2020-05-21 21:31:00
616,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan: Power-cut delays draining in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Large parts of Calcutta remained submerged on Thursday because several pumping stations that drain out water from the city remained unoperational following  power outage.Calcutta received more than 200mm rain on an average across the city on Wednesday and more than three-fourths of the precipitation happened between 5pm and 7pm, officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said. They said such heavy rainfall was bound to keep streets waterlogged for a long time.The drainage pumping stations in many areas could not work during the storm and till well past midnight as there was no power supply, a civic official said. “Normal services could resume only on Thursday morning.”The official said portable pumps had been kept ready in many low-lying pockets but “operating them in the dark was very difficult”.“We were ready but power supply had to be cut off for a long time and our operations got delayed a bit.”The waterlogging and the heavy rain meant water entered many houses, especially in low-lying areas.Many houses have their underground water reservoirs in such locations that water seeped in. “The contaminated water should not be consumed. People should use this water only for flushing in the toilet. It is better to collect tap water from the CMC’s taps to bathe, drink and cook,” said a public health professional.A CMC official said one of the ways to disinfect underground reservoir is to mix 500ml of sodium hypochlorite solution with 1,000 litres water. “This will disinfect the water but will not remove the foreign particles that have seeped,” the official said.“The reservoirs where run-off water has entered must be cleaned before the water is used for drinking or cooking,” the official said.",2020-05-21 21:31:00
617,TT Bureau,Cyclone Amphan: Water supply hit as power was turned off in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Water supply in several parts of Calcutta was affected on Thursday as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation could not operate water treatment plants between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning because power supply had to be suspended as a precaution.A senior CMC official said shortage was felt on Wednesday afternoon and evening across the city because potable water in adequate quantity could not be produced.The water that had been produced the day before was in the booster pumping stations-cum-reservoirs and that was supplied in the morning.A resident of Kasba said she did not receive water at home since power supply was cut off on Wednesday evening. “On Thursday, our underground reservoir became empty as there was no new supply in afternoon and evening,” the resident said.Booster pumping stations pump water into a network with added pressure so that it goes to far-flung areas. The water treated by the various plants is sent to the reservoirs in various localities.As a safety measure, power supply to the water treatment plants had been cut off between Wednesday evening and midnight. “After taking necessary precautions, we could resume production on Thursday morning,” an official said.“This resulted in a deficit in production. The volume of water supplied and the pressure in the lines were less than usual on Thursday afternoon and evening,” the official added.The CMC produces more than 400 million gallon water daily. Its largest production facility is the Palta water treatment plant. Garden Reach Water Works is the second largest.",2020-05-21 21:31:00
618,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Cyclone Amphan: 12-year-old sends SOS to teacher - Telegraph India,"A 12-year-old girl in Hingalganj in North 24-Parganas messaged her school headmaster at 7.30pm on Wednesday that her house was about to collapse.“Sir, amra khub kharap poristithi te achhi. Amader ghar kichu samay-er moddhe bhenge portey pare. (Sir, we are in a very bad state. Our house might collapse soon),” Rupsa Mondal said in her message.The Class VI student of Kanaknagar SD Institution and her parents had taken shelter in the bathroom because that was the only place in the house with a concrete roof.The rest of the house had a roof made of hay, which got blown away when Cyclone Amphan struck.“About 10 days ago we had built a concrete roof over the bathroom. It sheltered us as the cyclone raged outside,” Rupsa’s father Sankar Mondal, a landless farmer, said.Rupsa lives with her parents in Kothabari village in the Dulduli gram panchayat by the river. Around 6.30pm, the three ran for cover as the cyclone kept raging.“At one point I tried to step out of the bathroom to see whether our room was alright… the moment I tried to step out I lost balance and fell down. I didn’t try after that because I thought we needed to save our lives,” Mondal said.The three came out early on Thursday to find a rain-soaked bed, scattered rice, a tilted almirah and no roof. “When I called the student and spoke to her father, they seemed scared. Given their financial condition it will take a long time for them to rebuild their home,” Pulak Roy Chowdhury, the headmaster of Kanaknagar SD Institution in Sandelerbill in Hingalganj, said.",2020-05-21 21:32:00
619,Sanjay Mandal,Cyclone Amphan damages aircraft and two hangars at Kolkata Airport - Telegraph India,"At least two hangars of Air India at the Calcutta airport collapsed, one plane was smashed and portions of the terminal’s roof were blown away during Wednesday’s storm.Airport officials said hangars 16 and 17 collapsed because of the cyclone and a four-seater cessna aircraft, which was parked in hangar 16, was damaged after the structure crashed on it.A 42 seater ATR- 42, which was parked inside hangar 17, was brought out by the airline authorities and parked outside, just as many Calcuttans were taking out their cars from flooded garages.“That was the reason why the aircraft did not suffer any damage even though hangar 17 had collapsed,” an airport official said.However, the nose of the aircraft turned 180 degrees because of the strong winds, the official said.“The two hangars that collapsed were more than 50 years old and owned by Air India. We had asked them to remove the hangars several times because those were unauthorised constructions but they have not done so,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.“The aircraft that got damaged was parked by a private aviation company. For the last two years we have been asking the company in vain to remove the aircraft.”Air India officials could not be reached. Phones of at least two officials were unavailable through the day.Bigger aircraft are parked on the tarmac in the open. Officials said that earlier 52 aircraft used to be parked at the airport overnight. Now, the count has come down to 42 because of the lockdown.In several parts of the terminal, roof made of corrugated sheets was blown away.Officials said the roof had three layers of corrugated sheet and insulation. As the top layer was removed, there was a huge amount of water seepage, flooding parts of the terminal.“The roof will be repaired quickly,” said the airport director.Portions of the airport’s tarmac were flooded. “The main inundation was on the Kaikhali side. We were trying to pump the water out but were unable to do so because the adjoining areas were waterlogged,” the airport director said.The airport was closed till 5am on Thursday. An official said the airport finally became operational at noon with the take-off of a Spicejet flight to Delhi.A flight from Russia had arrived at 2.30 on Thursday to evacuate 103 Russian nationals who were stuck because of the lockdown.According to airport sources there was a delay in starting flight operations because several branches of trees had fallen on the tarmac and portions of the runaway, which needed to be cleaned.",2020-05-21 21:32:00
620,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Cyclone Amphan: Storm kills 19 in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Cyclone Amphan has killed at least 76 people across south Bengal, 19 of them in Calcutta.Most of the victims died of electrocution, after being crushed under uprooted trees and branches or after being hit by flying objects during the storm on Wednesday.“Seventy-two people have died across the state because of Amphan. Calcutta police commissioner has informed me that the death toll in the city is 15 till now,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday afternoon, while announcing a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh for the next of kin of the victims.Later in the evening, the joint commissioner (headquarters) of Calcutta police, Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, said: “Total 19 bodies have been found. Out of which, four are still unidentified (till around 9pm). The cause of death can be known after the post-mortem report comes.”Bodies were found strewn on the roads and floating on waterlogged streets at several places in the city on Thursday morning.One of them was found near Calcutta Club and one on a footpath near SSKM Hospital. The identity of both was yet to be ascertained, police said.Three deaths were reported on Noor Ali Lane, Anjuman Road and Syed Amir Ali Avenue in the Beniapukur area, close to Park Circus.One person died on Ripon Street, while five deaths were reported in the Parnasree area. Some of the victims in Parnasree were found floating on waterlogged streets.Deaths were also reported in Taltala, Watgunge, Maniktala, Girish Park, Regent Park and Karaya.“It appeared that the people whose bodies were found floating had died of electrocution. But the possibility of being hit by any flying object and then getting drowned in the water could not be ruled out,” said a senior police officer in the city police headquarters.Several officers said they could not recall the last time a natural calamity had left such a trail of devastation — in terms of life and property in the city.More than a dozen people died because of wall collapse, electrocution and being hit by tree branches in the adjoining commissionerates of Calcutta, such as Howrah, Barrackpore and Chandernagore.The following people died in the city when Amphan was gusting through it",2020-05-21 21:34:00
621,R. Rajagopal,Cyclone Amphan: Trek in cave of trees on Ballygunge Circular - Telegraph India,"First the full disclosures: I am on the wrong side of 50, I weigh 120-kg-plus, my exercise is limited to squeezing the lemon wedge and shaking the bottle to extract the last drop from both and I generally detest movement, especially that of my limbs.On Thursday afternoon, I had a problem: I had to reach my workplace on Bentinck Street, around 6km from my home on Dover Road, off Ballygunge Circular Road. Even for someone of my girth, it is a smooth ride every day, provided a car or the Metro is at your disposal and no rallies are lurking to lay an ambush.That this Thursday would not be a cakewalk was evident as early as on Wednesday evening when Cyclone Amphan struck Calcutta and I could return home from work only at 10am on Thursday, clocking nearly 22 hours in office and picking my way the last quarter of a mile through uprooted trees.I had returned home on Thursday morning via Park Circus and Ballygunge Phari, skirting Ballygunge Circular Road because any storm is usually not kind to the tree-lined curving stretch.Around 3.30pm, I realised that my phone connections were off and I could not contact my office. I had to reach office for a deadline-driven job.I hate movement but have been trained to think on my feet, like most of my colleagues. It did not take me long to decide to walk to office — 7km is not such a tall order. Braving sniggers at home, I borrowed my son’s waterproof sneakers and stepped in, only to realise that the soles could not take my weight and had come off.Then I settled down on slippers to wade through the water, stripped my backpack like a bomber on a mission, including emptying the water bottle because every drop counts in adding to the weight, and stepped out. As soon as I was out of the gate, I realised that the water had receded a bit and the edges of the road were visible. Just 25 steps and the straps of the slippers were already biting into my feet.I turned back — the mission aborted as soon as it had begun. I raced up the stairs, slipped into my forgotten Nike trainers with considerable effort and help from my wife and set out again, sharp at 4pm.Houston, we have a problem again. A neighbour has taken out his car from the flooded garage and parked it exactly where there was a dry stretch, which would have seen me through without drenching my trainers and socks.From the cobwebs of youth, a reminder from the NCC boot camp was beeping: come what may, keep your socks dry. Apparently, wet socks are recipe for disaster. Some soldiers give the matter as much importance as keeping their ammo dry.I requested the neighbour to move the car a bit so that I could squeeze through between the wall and the vehicle and step into the main road with the socks still dry. As I gave a thumbs-up to the good neighbour, I think I heard him say: “Where are you off to? You can’t go far…. Ballygunge Circular Road is completely blocked.”I assumed he must be talking about the road being inaccessible to vehicles and plodded on with whatever swagger a mass of 125kg can muster.Once I was on Ballygunge Circular Road, one of my favourite stretches of Calcutta, I could sense something was wrong. As always, the light or the lack of it gives you a whisper of a foreboding. Then comes the sound.Both were unsettling this afternoon. A canopy of darkness had descended on the wide road. Then there was the silence. Absolute silence born out of stillness — because no leaves were rustling. They could not because there was no wind. The road was like a cavernous dark-green cave, chiselled by an amateur who did not believe in modular shapes. The foliage of the uprooted trees — with trunks that made my tummy look tiny — had intertwined themselves to form a leafy bubble. From a distance, it looked like a gigantic and mouldy green wall, impenetrable and hostile. I felt trapped, overwhelmed and alone — and could sense dismay shaping up as a knot in my stomach. I would have to turn back, the second time within the hour.But I plodded on — walking imperiously in the middle of Ballygunge Circular Road on a weekday, something I had not done even during any Left bandh — probably because that is what we all do when we don’t know what to do.And the Archimedes bulb lit up in my couch-potato brain that had been washed clean of the muscle memory of my childhood days with trees.There is a gap between the branches. Always. Perhaps I was looking too hard for something positive to tell or perhaps I had watched The Ten Commandments so many times that I am convinced the sea always parts when you think it won’t. Again and again, there it was: a gap in the leaves and branches that I could squeeze through. An opening wide enough for my body mass and backpack survival kit.Amid fallen tree after fallen tree, I found a gap — every time — on this Thursday afternoon.This is not to say that it was smooth passage. The trunks were intimidating and slippery. Let alone stepping over them, if you placed your hand on them for support, your hand could slip and your armpit hit the solid wood with grievous consequences. Danger also lurked in the shape of wires of all thickness and colours.By now I am breathing hard and sweating buckets. Worse, the corona-season mask is clouding my glasses with vapour and affecting my vision.I paused in the middle of a foliage bubble, right in front of one of the most upscale apartments on the stretch, took off my backpack, placed it on a tree trunk and was about to sit down. Something, I don’t know what, held me back, which probably saved me. Partially blinded, I was about to sit on a protruding branch that was split down the middle and was as pointed and sharp as the tip of a spear. The glistening wood was hidden by the deceptive foliage that had earlier camouflaged the gap.Lesson number two from boot camp kicked in: push yourself to the limits during training but keep some energy in reserve in real-life situations. When you are tired, you lose the power to concentrate and you make mistakes — costly mistakes.It was then that I noticed the wires lying in wait like snakes. Most looked like cables that pipe television programmes and Net connectivity to our homes. Could some be carrying power? I had no idea and I was not about to find out.From then on, that became the obsession. How to thread and weave my way beneath and over wires hanging sometimes knee-high, sometimes overhead and sometimes coming ominously close to the neck like a garrotte.Belated full disclosure: I am claustrophobic. In front of the Ballygunge military camp, a titan of a tree had fallen across the road. I could find the gap easily — by now the hubris of the half-baked professional was setting in. But I had a problem — again: the gap was so narrow it looked like a tunnel, more like a funnel tapering towards the other end. The narrow end was weighed down by huge branches.I could not squeeze through without taking off my backpack, which was fine. But I needed to bend, and the back of my head was brushing against the foliage — a trigger for claustrophobic panic to set in. The impulse is to turn back and run. But the tunnel was so narrow I could not turn back, which probably saved me. There was no option but to push forward. Suffice to say that while emerging as a nervous, sweaty wreck, I learnt first hand the real meaning of the cliché “light at the end of the tunnel”.Not without damage. In the panic, I forgot the retrieved boot-camp lesson and stepped into a ditch, drenching my trainers and socks. It did feel comfortable initially because of the steaming environment but it became harder to walk with squishy socks.But size of the fallen trees was becoming relatively small, except one that blocked the main gates of La Martiniere for Girls. Eventually, I reached Park Street police station.By now my unfit body was sending me warning signs. I was becoming more breathless, my limbs, especially the hands, were becoming heavier. Should I walk on?Lesson number three: you are not a showboat, your job is to get the job done with as less damage as possible and using all resources at your disposal.I could hear some cars coming up behind me. I tried to hitch a ride and failed miserably, partially because I do not know how to strike with elan the universal pose and partly because a sweaty, bald and unshaven middle-aged man is not an inviting proposition even in normal times.Then came the Swiss knife of armchair explorers: the yellow cab. The very first one mercifully agreed to ferry me but the cabbie said he could not go beyond Esplanade, just a stone’s throw from my destination.If you are reading this, it means my mission had been successful and I could play a role in bringing out this newspaper tonight.The urge to refer to the plight of the walking migrants is irresistible. But to even mention, let alone compare, my possibly irresponsible trek and the migrants’ gruelling journey to further misery in the same breath would amount to dishonouring the lessons I learnt — and re-learnt — this Thursday afternoon.",2020-05-22 00:13:00
622,Brinda Sarkar,"In a township in the grip of Covid-19 fear, medical help for other ailments is proving hard to get - Telegraph India","A couple of weeks ago Asis Karmakar showed his aching leg to his doctor through a window. He stood across the doctor’s pavement garden and explained his symptoms over phone, holding up his leg as high as he could, the pain notwithstanding.Far from complaining, the Kestopur resident was grateful. “This Sector I doctor is the only one who agreed to see me,” he says. “All other doctors I know in Kestopur and Salt Lake have shut their chambers because of the pandemic.”  Moinak Dutta was to take his father, a cancer patient, for check-up in end-March but the hospital put it off. “I called their helpline for weeks but no one picked up,” says the AJ Block resident. “Finally they called and fixed an appointment for this week.”Dutta’s year-old daughter was also due to get her hepatitis A vaccine during the lockdown but the hospital has put that off indefinitely too. “The doctor says the delay won’t matter but she has two more shots lined up in the coming months. Can an infant take so many shots together?”Like other industries, healthcare has taken a hit because of the lockdown. Covid-19 may be the most infectious disease doing the rounds but that’s not stopped heart attacks, strokes, TB or UTI, and without doctors to consult patients are in the lurch. Even as some doctors finally start reopening clinics, the problem is far from over.Doctors can be patients tooPatit Paban Paira, homeopathy doctor of CE Block, is 78 years of age. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his daughter is a doctor at an all-Covid hospital. “I am already in the high risk group. Would it be safe for me to come in contact with patients who may have Covid-19?” he asks.The doctor is tending to patients over the phone and those that are landing up anyway, he is seeing through a netted window without letting them in.Eye specialists are among the most at risk of infection. “When we use an ophthalmoscope, our nose almost brushes that of the patient,” points out Purnendu Bikash Sarkar, an eye specialist who runs a clinic in IA Block. Since March 19, he is staying cooped up in his Purbachal 4R apartment, keeping his chamber shut. “I had seven operations that day and decided not to take any more risk. I am a senior citizen myself.”Dentist Sambit Sourav Panda says it would be a huge challenge to reopen his clinic in Downtown Mall outside Uniworld City. “Other doctors work on pen and paper but we work on people’s open mouths, from where oral infections readily spread. So susceptible are dentists to viral infections that every six months we get ourselves checked for illnesses like hepatitis, but what to check for Covid  when there is no definitive vaccine or cure?”Apollo Clinic City Centre has reopened and Dr Adrija Rahman Mukherjee has resumed her visits. “But nothing is foolproof,” says the BB Block consultant physician and specialist in family medicine. “My patients are coming with N95 masks but I am wearing a flimsy surgical one as I could not lay my hands on an N95. I have no gloves, face shield or PPE either. Some rooms at the clinic have no windows to allow air circulation (ACs are not advisable now) and there’s no provision for changing sheets after every patient lies on the bed for examination.” However, she has noted that up to 20 per cent of patients who could have been treated over phone are insisting they come to the clinic just so they can get out of the house.Medical oncologist Gouri Shankar Bhattacharyya has been on duty throughout at DD Ten hospital but he knows many doctors who have backed out. “Can we blame them?” he asks. “PPEs are so few in number, their quality is suspect, there are no clear directives on how to use them…”Hiding symptomsRajesh Kumar Chel was home-bound for the first 15 days of lockdown. “And the feeling was mutual. Even patients were wary of calling outsiders home. But now I am as busy as ever,” says the HB Block doctor.But he calls for transparency. “Sometimes patients with fever are calling me over citing stomach ache as they think I would not come otherwise. If a patient describes Covid-19 symptoms over phone I shall ask him to get tested. But if I get Covid what will happen to my 4,000-strong family of patients?”A patient whom dentist Santanu Roy treated three days before the lockdown tested positive for Covid-19 four days later. “This other patient was feverish while I treated him. Afterwards when I was chatting with him he revealed that he was just back from the US,” says the CD Block resident. “Patients are suppressing facts  for fear of getting quarantined but this will spread infection.”Dangers of self-medicationWith doctors missing in action, some patients are resorting to self-medication, says dermatologist Dr Imran Wali, “and with disastrous consequences.”“When medicines and home remedies are ledaing to reactions, they are being forced to forget about Covid and come over anyway,” Wali says. Last week one such patient — a 90-year-old at that — landed up at his CL Block chamber all the way from Sundarbans in an ambulence.“I don’t have screening equipment like thermal guns at home at home but I couldn’t refuse him.”Bhattacharya also blames social media for spreading wrong information and misguiding patients. “It’s a pandemic of stupidity facilitated by the university of WhatsAap and Facebook,” he says.Indeed Dr Rupa Ghosh of AB Block has had patients who are “sanitising” vegetables by soaking them in Lysol or pressure-cooking them with Dettol. “Vegetable surfaces are porus and these people are foolishly ingesting harmful chemicals. More than medicines my prescription to them is to stop following fake news.”Tele-medicineThough operations are off the table, eye specialist Sarkar  is seeing patients through teleconference. “I am doing WhatsApp video calls. That way, I can deal with simple cases like conjunctivitis or iritis.” He is sending patients power checking charts by WhatsApp, asking them to place the phone six feet away and read the alphabets that appear on its screen one by one, by shutting one eye at a time. Family members are being asked to help out by holding a torch to the eye as he asks the patients to look right or left. “They are also clicking close-up pictures of their eyes and sending me. There are magnifying apps available through which I am checking the pictures.” Sarkar has seen close to 150 patients this way, using virtual wallets to collect fees.He admits that with tests like telemetry, biometry and funduscopy not being done at his clinic, treatment was proving difficult in many cases. “This morning, someone called me to complain that he could not see in the left eye. On checking him on screen, I could make out that he needed a funduscopy. So I told him to look for places which are doing it,” said Sarkar.Back in the day, Chel would look down on tele-medicine but now there is no other way out. “Patients get some confidence seeing the doctor, even if over video call,” he says. Chel has left it up to patients to pay him or not in such cases.Wali says the medium has its challenges. “If the patient’s phone isn’t a high end one, the pictures they  send of the problem aren’t clear,” he says.Panda is prescribing medicines over video calls but is backing out in severe cases. “Some cases cannot be treated arbitrarily. I’m forced to refuse such patients. I’m asking them to try their luck in big hospitals that may have the infrastructure to sanitise their chambers,” he says.Rahman Mukherjee says tele-medicine juggles with many variables. “Even if a patient has a blood pressure machine at home, does he know how to use it properly? Is the machine working properly?” she asks. “As for online payment, rural folk and the elderly are not familiar with the system.”Bhattacharya is asking patients to download health apps that check their pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation. “The apps are reasonably accurate, at least under such extreme conditions. If patients have wear-on bands that indicate these levels I’m asking them to use them too.”Before reopening clinicsOn Sunday dentist Dr Roy reopened his clinic, equipped with thermal guns and sanitisers. He himself is treating patients wearing PPE, face shields, N95 masks, shoe covers and protection goggles. “We cannot use the AC now and so I’m getting bathed in sweat under all this equipment,” says the CD Block resident. “It’s too risky to use aerosol-generating equipment now so tooth filling, scaling etc are out of the question. Only extraction and pain management is on.”Dr Papiya Dutta has roped in two different agencies to sanitise her CK Block chamber every week. “I’m seeing one-tenth of the patients I would before. The rest I’m advising over phone. Even the patients coming in are being asked to wait for their turn in their cars,” she says.Sharmishtha Ghosh of CD Block is making patients sit behind a curtain while narrating their case history. “I’m calling them in for examination, after which I’m asking them to sit outside so I can write out the prescription. I’m wearing a mask but not gloves as they are ruining my handwriting,” she says.Panda plans to open his chamber in a fortnight but he will make patients sign a form beforehand, declaring that no one in their family has Covid symptoms.New Town modelFaced with the plight of residents, a residents’ body in New Town, called New Town Forum & News, has created a panel of doctors who are local residents and, more importantly, who are willing to attend to calls from patients. Of them, Bibek Panda has been the most active. “I have attended to 30 to 40 calls ever since the lockdown started. The calls invariably come late in the evening and are mostly from senior citizens who have hurt themselves or their spouse has been hurt by falling and they needed stitches,” said Panda.A resident of Rail Vihar, he picks up an assistant from near Tata Memorial Center and sets off. “I cannot do a stitch alone,” he says. Another couple of calls has been for catheter blocks. Panda is aware that many doctors are refusing to meet patients, leave alone see them at home. “Someone has to go.” He attends to patients in a three-ply mask and gloves. “I do have PPE in the car. NKDA gave me two. So far I have used a PPE just once. I ask before going whether the patient has any Covid-19 symptoms.”“NKDA has also asked us to prepare a database of doctors in each block. There are about 20 doctors on an average in a New Town block, of which barely one or two are stepping out on call. The rest stay cooped up, often not revealing their professional identity to even their next-door neighbour. They have their reasons as people tend to call them for even cough and cold or to check their blood pressure at night. If they refuse to attend, they become villains,” said Ankur Roy Choudhury, a member of the forum.“Even as we draw up the list of doctors, the majority are requesting not to pass on their contact to NKDA,” he added.In the name of HippocratesRupa Ghosh says her AB Block neighbours have been asking her not to let in patients during the pandemic but she has shut them up saying this is what she became a doctor for.Bhattacharya feels that such narrow-minded behaviour by the society is a stark contrast to a few Sundays ago when they loudly clanged on steel plates to thank doctors for their services.Sharmishtha Ghosh has turned a deaf ear to her family and friends and not stopped working for even a day during the lockdown. “Previously I would return home at midnight but these days it is so deserted at night that I’m returning by 10.30pm,” she says.How she returns home is a saga. Usually her son drives her to and from her chambers at Ultadanga and Maniktala but if he has office work, she happily hitch-hikes. “If I can get a rickshaw till Bengal Chemicals (and Pharmaceuticals), I walk the remaining 5km,” says the 60-year-old. “Sometimes I take lifts from bike riders, the Maniktala police sometimes drops me back till Labony and from there I walk home till CD Block…”“When graduating medical college 30 years ago I had taken the Hippocratic Oath and it is my duty to serve the sick without thinking of myself. Besides, I believe fortune favours the brave,” she says.Dentist Panda’s wife Namrata Dhar Choudhury is a doctor at a government facility in Diamond Harbour and she has been hiring a driver to ferry her to work. “My friend’s cousin passed away during the lockdown when they couldn’t find a doctor and I find this very sad. My parents are doctors too and none of us can imagine refusing patients in need,” says the lady who lives near City Centre 2.Animal kingdomThe situation is just as bleak in the animal kingdom.Back in the day Cats n Dogs pet clinic in CJ Block had three vets coming. “Not one of them has come for one day during the lockdown,” says Arijit Mukherjee, who runs the centre. “It’s been so difficult managing without vets. There was a complicated pregnancy of a Labrador that had to be performed by a para-vet in the absence of a trained professional. Anything could have gone wrong.”Vet Krishanu Ghosh started online consultations from the first week of April and says it is working out so well that he shall continue it even after lockdown. “I’ve got calls from Pune and Bhopal too,” he says.He has recently resumed sitting at New Town’s Animel Planet once a week. “We are taking bookings of no more than eight patients to avoid crowding but somehow double the number are landing up,” he says. Krishanu has postponed vaccines of adult dogs for now and is giving shots to puppies alone.A few customers are backing out upon learning that the vet is charging Rs 300 for the Zoom video call consultancy but he reasons that this is his bread and butter. “The fee is less than face-to-face consultation and since they would have paid for the latter anyway, then why not this?",2020-05-22 16:46:00
623,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Cables made structures unstable: KMC officials - Telegraph India,"Civic officials have attributed the high count of electric poles felled by Cyclone Amphan to the weight of cables on them.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has estimated that around 4,000 electric poles have been uprooted across the city and from most of them a mesh of wires used to dangle.Some of the cables were power, broadband and cable TV wires. Often, it is difficult to distinguish one from the other.Many of the cables have become defunct but they are all jumbled up and they keep hanging in various parts of the city.Civic officials said that ideally there should be overhead electric wires only where there are no underground lines.But most cable TV and broadband operators tie their cables around lamp posts because the underground route is labour and technology intensive.“A pole with a few wires can withstand the wind force but an overload of wires adds to the weight of the pole. By tying cables to poles, the surface area of the pole increases, causing it to topple when a storm blows,” said an engineer in the corporation.Physicists in the city said the wires hanging from the poles, mostly jumbled up, resist the air flow.“The weight of the wires pull the pole downwards. Because of the hanging wires, the surface area of the obstruction to the air flow is more, increasing the effect of the wind on the pole. That increases the chance of the pole getting uprooted,” said Emdadul Islam, a former director of the Birla Industrial & Technological Museum.Former mayor Firhad Hakim (he is now chairperson of the CMC’s board of administrators) had repeatedly told cable operators and internet service providers to remove the defunct overhead wires.He had also given them an ultimatum and a deadline to remove the defunct wires or at least mark the live wires so that the corporation could remove the ones not in use.Metro has been highlighting the wire menace in the city for several years.The city has at least seven multi-system operators that transmit TV signals through cables and more than 12 broadband service providers, which provide internet connections using the same method.Since MSOs and broadband service providers compete with each other across the city, a pole in any neighbourhood is likely to have wires of many of them.The mesh of wires dangling overhead also pose a threat to people on the roads.In fact, the fire at Bagree Market had brought to the fore the hazard of the overhead mesh of wires. Hydraulic ladders had been deployed to spray water on the fire at Bagree Market but they could not be used because of the wire mesh. The corporation had said that since they did not know which were cable TV wires and which were power cables, they could not cut the lines.",2020-05-22 21:43:00

Metro tracked and found how some of these citizens had died — on the roads or in their homes.In Bengal, the death toll rose to 86 on Friday. Twenty-eight of the victims were electrocuted, 22 crushed under trees, 21 hit by collapsed walls, seven buried under debris of houses, three drowned, two knocked down by uprooted lamp posts and one was bitten by a snake.Two of the victims are suspected to have succumbed to electric shock.Some of the deaths in the cityHe was closing his shop and planning to go home to escape the cyclone, an officer said.The police said the preliminary post-mortem report suggested the presence of liquor in his stomach. The exact cause of death has yet to be ascertained, an officer said.Family members have told the police that he had stepped out after the cyclone had receded to collect money from someone.Sahadad Beg, 24, Sir Syed Ahmed Road, Beniapukur: Beg was found dead near a lamp post close to his home around 7pm.

626,Pinak Ghosh,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Net, electricity hit banking services in Bengal - Telegraph India","Erratic power supply and Net connectivity in the wake of Cyclone Amphan hit banking services in Bengal on Friday.Operations at branches of various banks and ATMs were affected. Even digital banking, a key channel during the lockdown for bank customers, wasn’t smooth because of poor Net connectivity.The bulk of the impact was felt at branches with an estimated 30 per cent of them remaining offline. There are 9,331 branches of public sector banks, private banks, foreign banks, payment banks, small finance banks and regional rural banks in the state.The banks, though, could run critical back-end services to prevent a complete system collapse.Operations were affected in parts in the districts of North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, Calcutta, Hooghly, Howrah and East Midnapore.Banks, according to officials, faced three major challenges — Net connectivity, power and accessibility to branches in places where road connection has been lost to uprooted trees.Also, coordinating human resource was a challenge because of unstable mobile networks, they said.“Most of the critical banking infrastructure is intact. It is just Net and power-related problems, which are a challenge at many locations,” Ranjan Kumar Mishra, the chief general manager of State Bank of India, said.“Around 70 per cent of our branches are operational; we hope to get 90 per cent of our branches running at the earliest. We are in constant touch with service providers to keep the network running.”The banks operations at the regional office on Strand Road was largely normal, Mishra said.As part of the business continuity plan, places where branches are unable to operate, the nearest functional branch is being utilised to cater to the immediate needs of customers, he said.Many customers and merchants were wary of using digital wallets, point-of-sale terminals and internet banking channels on Thursday and matters did not improve on Friday.“Most banks have seen a surge in digital transactions in the past few months during the lockdown. But an unstable Net and an erratic power supply after the cyclone has added to the challenge,” an executive with a private bank said.“Laptops and mobile hotspots are being used wherever possible to keep basic services operational. But we have to keep security in mind as well.”Bandhan Bank, which has a major network in the state, has said close to 65,000 of its micro banking borrowers with a total exposure of around Rs 260 crore could be impacted because of the cyclone.The affected portfolio is expected to regularise by the third quarter of 2020-21, the bank has said.Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, the bank’s managing director and CEO, said the state administration was playing a key role in the recovery process.At least 7-10 days will be needed for normal operations to resume, various banks have said.",2020-05-22 22:38:00
627,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal halts Covid-19 patient's cremation - Telegraph India,"The cremation of 20 Covid-19 patients was held up between Wednesday evening and Friday morning because transporting bodies to the Dhapa crematorium was difficult in the wake of Cyclone Amphan, the civic body has said.The power supply to the crematorium was restored on Friday morning, Firhad Hakim, the chairman of Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s (CMC) board of administrators, said.The state government has assigned the crematorium to cremate people who die after testing positive for Covid-19.“The power supply to the crematorium had been cut off on Wednesday evening when the storm was blowing across Calcutta. Since the wind was predicted to be stronger in east Calcutta, the power supply was cut off,” Hakim said.Many power lines snapped after the cyclone struck and that, too, added to the time taken to restore power supply to the crematorium, a civic official said.After the restoration of power supply, it took some time for cremation to start, the civic official said.Deceased Covid-19 patients from Calcutta and adjoining districts are being taken to the crematorium at Dhapa.A burial ground at Bagmari has been identified to bury people who die after testing positive for Covid-19.Hakim said the delay in cremation happened because many of the bodies could not be transported after the cyclone struck the city.Ambulances were not available to transport the bodies since Wednesday morning, a CMC official said. “Ambulance owners and drivers were worried about the storm. So, they did not venture out since morning,” the CMC official said.On Thursday, waterlogged streets and roads blocked by uprooted trees and electric poles hampered the transportation of bodies, the official said.",2020-05-22 22:46:00
628,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Lab research lost to power cut  - Telegraph India,"A power cut in laboratories has led to loss of research material accumulated over at least 10 years, scientists of Calcutta University have said.Some of the materials that need to be refrigerated at less than minus 85 degrees centigrade, were found at plus 20 degrees on Friday afternoon, amplifying the magnitude of the crisis.Bio specimens such as cell lines and tissues that need refrigeration at this critical temperature in the laboratories of the Ballygunge science college campus of Calcutta University have been lost, a scientist said.“We have to start from scratch. We keep archiving the research done by the outgoing batch of students for the next batch to work on it and take it forward. Everything has been wasted because of the power cut… the university, too, is to blame,” the scientist said.Another scientist said power utility company CESC had restored power to the college on Thursday morning, but the teachers could not contact any members of university staff to switch back power to the laboratories.The building’s east wing, which has the biology, zoology and biochemistry laboratories did not have power till Friday afternoon, he said.Developing a stable cell line takes five to 10 years, a teacher said. The bio specimens that had been preserved at minus 85 degrees centigrade, are considered to be “the most precious”, the teacher said.Specimens that require refrigeration at minus 20 degrees and minus five degrees centigrade, too, have been wasted. “We have lost a legacy. Even the chemicals stored in the laboratories have been wasted.”“Registrar Debasish Das told me that no teacher had alerted him about any difficulty. He said electricity has been restored,” university vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjeerjee said when Metro asked her about the matter.The loss of research materials is not restricted to Calcutta University. Scientists and scholars at several research institutes in the city said their work had suffered for want of power and internet connection. The research work of at least 40 scientists has been affected on the Ultadanga campus of the Centre-run Bose Institute.Gaurishnkar Sa, who is researching on cancer immunotherapy at the institute, said his research would be delayed by six months. The institute has been without power, water and internet for three days, Sa, who is also the chairman of the institute’s molecular medicine division, said.",2020-05-22 22:49:00
629,Mita Mukherjee,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Exam worry as institutes of Bengal turn storm shelters - Telegraph India,"Hundreds of schools and colleges that are scheduled to be exam centres in a few weeks are now storm shelters for tens of thousands of people driven out of their homes by Cyclone Amphan.The buildings have been housing 400-1,500 people since Tuesday night, principals of several schools and colleges said on Friday.The remaining Higher Secondary exams are slated to be held on June 2, 6, and 29. Calcutta University’s final-year exams are scheduled for mid-July.The heads of several institutions said they were worried if the buildings would be available by then because those living there now have lost their homes.Close to 400 people have been staying at a school in Diamond Harbour. “We understand the plight of these poor, homeless people. But it will be difficult for us to clean and sanitise the campus before the Higher Secondary exam are held,” the school’s headmaster said.“The rescued people are being served cooked food, which is being prepared on the campus. They are mostly staying in the classrooms… using toilets meant for the students. Some have even brought ducks and hens along with them.”The school has been slotted as an exam centre.Calcutta University had issued a notice to all colleges to start sanitising their campuses once they reopen after June 10.A college in Raidighi, South 24-Parganas, affiliated to Calcutta University, has housed close to 500 people. Food is being prepared on the premises.Electric and water connection have snapped and overhead water tanks have blown away. People are using students’ toilets. They have been fetching water from a nearby pond, the college principal said.“The premises will have to be thoroughly cleaned. We need sufficient time to repair the damage, sanitise the campus and make the college ready to hold the university exams,” the principal said.A college in Gosaba affiliated to Calcutta University has at least 1,000 people on the premises.

The college needs a thorough repair… it has to be cleaned and sanitised before the exams.”",2020-05-22 22:51:00
630,Subhankar Chowdhury,Storm felled trees & smashed sculpture at JU - Telegraph India,"Hundreds of trees were ripped apart on the leafy Jadavpur University campus during Wednesday’s storm and many of the corridors were beyond recognition on Friday. A sculpture that was installed in front of the Central Library in 2005 to celebrate the journey of education on the occasion of JU’s golden jubilee was smashed as trees came crashing down on it.A visit to the campus, spread across 58 acres, would leave one in shock, given the loss of greenery. Over 200 trees  have been uprooted, said an official.Giants like mahogany and banyan were uprooted and felled trees blocked the concrete driveway that leads to  Aurobindo Bhavan.Logs and trunks of trees that were nurtured over the years blocked the pathway to the football ground.The campus has been shut because of the lockdown since March 16.A university official said environmentalist Dipankar Chakravarty, who is credited with spreading awareness on arsenic poisoning, took special care for an aforestation drive on the campus so that bio-diversity could be enhanced and the campus could become ideal for study.Over the years the university created green zones.The state forest department had undertaken a special aforestation drive in JU 2007.Metro had to walk through the ground to reach the rear of the administrative headquarters (Aurobindo Bhavan) as the passage was blocked with felled trees.The passage to an eight-storey building from the engineering faculty students’ union office was covered with trunks and branches. The stretch that runs along the railway line was inaccessible for a walk.Rows of trees fell on the lane of Raja Subodh Mullick Road that goes past the campus. The lane was closed to traffic as none came to remove the trunk.A portion of the boundary wall between gates 4 and 3 was razed to the ground.Soumyajit Biswas, deputy director, eastern region, National Medicinal Plant Board, visited the campus to take stock of the loss.The university had engaged him last year to do an audit of the trees.“The university has various rare species. We have to ascertain whether those were uprooted, too,” said Biswas.Pro-vice-chancellor Pradip Ghosh came to the campus in the afternoon to assess the extent of damage.“When Aila had struck in 2009, the extent of loss to the greenery was less severe. JU would not look the same in the absence of the green cover. I am feeling sad,” said Ghosh.Abhijit Gupta, a former head of the English department who visited the campus on Friday afternoon, said: “I was extremely pained because of the loss of greenery. The campus has such a rich biodiversity. A part of it seems to have been lost.”Samantak Das, a professor of comparative literature, said they would soon raise funds so that a sculpture could be installed again.“We would soon have it (the damaged sculpture) replaced,” said Das.",2020-05-22 22:56:00

I was told that he was gasping in front of our entry gate and soon collapsed unconscious on the pavement. We got an umbrella to provide him shade from the sun as he was frothing at the mouth and I called another volunteer Samaresh Das,” said Syed Humayun Siraj, a JVT resident.Another volunteer, Supriyo Chaudhuri, who stays in the neighbourhood, brought a shirt and lungi to put on him. The area being under the Kolkata Leather Complex police station, the thana was contacted by the New Town police station, which was initially alerted by the resident volunteers.A sub-inspector from the KLC police station arrived from the outpost in front of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute second campus, which is functioning as a Covid hospital, and searched the man’s belongings. “We found a phone number on him, on calling which we got to know that he was from Bangladesh and was getting chemotherapy treatment at Tata Memorial Center. Since he developed fever, he had been asked to get a Covid test done at the ID (Infectious Diseases) Hospital, Beleghata. But he must have mistaken the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute for ID Hospital and was walking alone towards it when he lost consciousness. We tried reviving him by spraying water on his face while the police tried arranging for an ambulance,” said Das.An hour and half later, the unconscious man was put on an ambulance. According to Swarup Kanti Pahari, the officer-in-charge of KLC police station, he was admitted to Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute in south Calcutta.Later, the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission was alerted. He was identified as Mohd. Mojammel Hossein from Faridpur district. ",2020-05-23 12:37:00
632,Snehal Sengupta,Salt Lake: Only 2 gates to open in markets  - Telegraph India,"All block markets in Salt Lake are likely to have only two gates open for the coming few weeks.A joint civic and police team is expected to visit the markets and implement a rule where only one gate for entry and one for exit will be kept open.Krishna Chakraborty, the mayor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said that they were planning to ask all market committees to install hand wash facilities at the gates or to keep sanitisers. “We will also help them. We will hold a meeting on this soon,” she said.Chakraborty said the civic body wants to ensure that everyone who enters a market sanitises or washes their hands, thereby reducing the risk of the community transmission of the coronavirus.Many residents, however, said that this might result in overcrowding near the gates.Soham Chakraborty, an ED Block resident, felt that since most markets in Salt Lake have a number of gates, entry and exit of shoppers take places in a way that the gates do not get crowded. “If they implement a single entry gate rule it might lead to crowding, which was not happening till now,” said Chakraborty.Duttabad casesMeanwhile, the lockdown measures have been strengthened in Duttabad as at least two residents have tested positive for Covid-19 there.A 15-year-old boy is one of the two.

People are calling it a pandemic but I think it’s a green-demic!” said Neela Majumder of Earth Day Network.Majumder, whose city office is at Alipore, was attending a webinar hosted by Techno India University (TIU). Being an online event, the show was attended by experts around the country and moderated by Pauline Laravoire, sustainability director of TIU and co-founder Y-East, a network of professionals working for the environment.Majumder explained how 50 years ago chimneys belching out thick black smoke was seen as a sign of prosperity in the West. “The concept of Earth Day was started to mobilise the youth to take cognisance of the environment. It was after this that the government in the US passed environmental bills and the like,” she said.Earth Day Network is based in Washington and the body coordinates Earth Day events across the globe on April 22. This year was their 50th annual celebration.All events in 2020 are under the cloud of Covid-19 and Earth Day was no different. Pauline asked the experts if they found any similarities between the Covid crisis and that of climate change.Covid and climate change“Climate change is as serious as Covid-19 but since it’s a slow process the world ignores it,” said Deb A. Mukherjee, president designate of Bengal Chamber Commerce and Industry Kolkata (BCC&I). “If Covid is like a 100m dash, climate change is a marathon and unfortunately, we have to run both. If we ignore climate change it can overwhelm us the way Covid has now.”Mukherjee said that both Covid and climate change were pushing the world to societal transformation. “The catch now is to see whether sustainability and renewability form part of the recovery process,” he said.While Mukherjee was optimistic, he recalled how carbon emission rose after the 2008 recession in an attempt to increase global production and revive the economy.Shiraz Wajih of the Gorakhpur Environmental Action Group joined the discussion from Uttar Pradesh. “I don’t expect any real change in the long run,” he confessed. His group, founded in 1975 works on farmers, climate change and disaster resilience.“We are now feeling sorry at the agony of migrant labourers stuck in the cities but think of why they had to leave their villages in the first place. Climate change is leading to bad crop production and affecting the income of the rural population. The youth there has no option but to move to the cities in search of a living,” Wajih said. “The global standstill has given us an opportunity to change the way things are run but the question is whether or not we learn from the situation.”Leave animals alonePauline cited a study which said that 60 per cent of vector-borne diseases come from animals and wondered if people were meddling too much with nature. To this Sourabh J. Sarkar, founder of Karmyog Greens urban eco-village opposite Biswa Bangla Convention Centre, couldn’t agree more. “We have to respect boundaries of the animal kingdom and realise that bats, chimps, tigers, people — we are all in this together. If we don’t leave animals alone we disrupt the ecological balance,” he said.He asked the audience to read a 2013 book by David Quammen’s called Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic to realise how extreme things can get. “As for climate change, the climate is something we don’t have control over so the least we can do is to revere it. How many of us look up at the sun with a sense of surrender?” Sarkar asked.Role of educationTIU has taken several measures to make its campus eco-friendly and its students environmentally responsible. They are even ready to launch an MBA course on waste management. Pauline took the opportunity ask the experts what role education could play in changing mindsets.To this, Sarkar answered that there could not be a gap between what is taught and practised. “Imagine a situation where a student drives across city from Barackpore to Behala to take an exam on environmental studies. It defeats the very purpose of conservation,” he explained.Majumder felt that the Covid-19 pandemic has rubbed in the message that there is no Planet B. “We can take this lockdown period to think about living responsibly. We can make small changes around us like switching to energy-saving LED lights, using reusable bags instead of plastic ones, may be not cook for a day as a way of saving energy,” she said, adding that if this can be turned into a habit, Earth Day would not restricted to a day but become an ongoing movement.Pauline noted how the world has been forced away from consumerism during the lockdown due to lack of options. “Do you think we will return to the old ways after this?” she wondered.Majumder asked people to give this a thought by going through their wardrobes. “Use your time to de-clutter our closet and donate to charity clothes that you haven’t worn in a year.”Lower carbon footprintBy hosting a webinar, Pauline felt the scale had been tremendous. “Many more people could attend it sitting home than if they had to come over to a venue. That also means that much less carbon footprint,” she said.However, over a webinar one cannot read the eyes and faces of the audience so we one cannot be sure of their involvement. But the lockdown has proven that institutions from now on need to depend on technology as well as face-to-face communication from now on.”Finally, Pauline shared a trick to always stay motivated. “When doing something with a negative environmental impact, stop and think what would happen if everyone did what you were doing. Similarly, you’ll find a push to do good when you think of what would happen if everyone did the good you were doing,” she smiled.",2020-05-23 12:40:00
636,TT Bureau,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Power-less pockets of Kolkata erupt in protest - Telegraph India,"Hundreds of fresh protest pockets cropped up across Calcutta over the absence of power and water for more than 72 hours since Cyclone Amphan battered the city. While protests were restricted to main roads on Friday, they spread to lanes and bylanes on Saturday.The Telegraph lists some places rocked by protestBehalaAround 50 protesters, a large number of them women, blocked Biren Roy Road (West) from 8.30am on Saturday. The residents of wards 126, 127 and 128 said they were without power for over 72 hours. A car with a board that had “Judge” written on it was among many vehicles that were left stranded by the blockade.“You are in a position of power. Please make our voice heard,” a protester was seen telling a woman who stepped out to plead with the group to let the car pass.Salt LakeSporadic protests took place in Salt Lake after residents complained that the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation was doing precious little to remove the fallen trees and restore power.In BH Block, residents protested the delay in removing a tree that got uprooted and fell diagonally across the road before coming to a rest on a balcony of a house near the Tank No. 7 bus stop. Vivek Choudhary, a businessman who lives in the building with his family, said the corporation had not removed the tree despite repeated calls.Anita Mondal, the local councillor, said she had to run from pillar to post to get a team equipped with axes and power saws. “We don’t have enough personnel,” said Mondal. BaguiatiResidents of several areas in Baguiati, Kestopur and Arjunpur protested near the Baguiati bus stop as they have been without water and electricity since the storm barrelled through the city. The protesters refused to give way to any vehicle alleging that neither men from the power utility nor civic officials were seen in the area. The residents removed the blockade after senior police officers promised help.BansdroniIn Bansdroni, residents blocked lanes by logs of fallen trees. On a stretch of Ashok Avenue, off NSC Bose Road, the protesters did not allow even cyclists to pass through. “We did not do anything till Friday. Our patience snapped on Saturday,” said Saikat Pal.NetajinagarA group of protesters in Ward number 9 in Netajinagar Colony blocked the road in front of Netajinagar police station. “We went to police repeatedly, requesting them to get in touch with CESC for us. We have been without power since Wednesday evening. Since there is no response, we decided to protest,” said Joy Bose.SurjonagarIn Surjonagar, between Bansdroni and Ranikuthi, even residents of police quarters joined the protest that had started on Friday. Madhumita Das Mahapatra, a resident of the quarters and one of the protesters, said: “Last night, we heard that a group of CESC workers would come to fix the lines. But a group of people from the adjoining lanes dragged them away. How would we survive?” asked Mahapatra.The road between the Ranikuthi crossing and the GD Birla Centre for Education was also blocked. A cop pleaded with the protesters so that he could reach Netajinagar police station but his plea was turned down.“We have not allowed even your seniors to pass through. We won’t budge till power is restored,” a protester was heard telling the cop on a motorcycle.Swiss ParkThe scale of protest was so huge in Swiss Park, near Charu Market, that power minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay had to visit the site to talk to residents.“I held several meetings with CESC and my department. I have given them instructions but they are saying they are unable to work. There are not enough personnel,” said Chatterjee, who turned up at the protest site around 1pm.Baishnabghata and Garia ParkResidents of Baishnabghata and Garia Park (wards 100 and 110) stacked tyres, chairs and bamboo poles on Raja SC Mullick Road, in front of Dinabandhu Andrews College, and also near the Route 5 bus terminus. “Even the councillor is not bothering to meet us,” said an agitator.TopsiaMaruti Bagan in Topsia has remained in the dark since 5pm on Wednesday, residents said. Nilanjan Dey, one of the protesters, said that when they  called up CESC, they were told that nothing could be done till a fallen tree on the Park Circus connector was removed.“The CMC said they did not have enough personnel to remove the tree,” said Nilanjana Dey, a resident. A CESC team finally arrived at 4.30pm and the supply to some pock-ets was restored half an hour later.But those areas were again plunged into darkness as the restored phase blew off. The area has remained unlit since then.AnandapurResidents of Anandapur blocked EM Bypass, near VIP Market, from Saturday morning for two hours. The protesters alleged that CESC personnel had not visited the area even once.KhardahResidents blocked Kalyani Expressway demanding resumption of power and water supply. A section of the protesters allegedly clashed with the police.Amtala, HowrahMore than 100 people blocked Andul Road, near Amtala Phanri, for nearly an hour around 6pm. They complained there had been no electricity in the area since Wednesday.Nearly 100 residents blocked GT Road at 10.30am on the same issue. The protest continued for an hour. Similar protest were held on Kona Expressway and in Uluberia.",2020-05-23 21:03:00
638,Sudipta Bhattacharjee,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal has taken us back 50 years - Telegraph India,"And God said, let there be light. And there was light.Alas, the takeaway from Genesis does not hold true any longer, at least in this Amphan-wracked city. Since Wednesday, when the cyclone raged in the city, our little pocket on the eastern fringes, Survey Park, has been without power, phone connectivity and subsequently water. We grappled with two window frames being wrenched open and flying off to the neighbour’s terrace, scattering glass shards, but worse was in store.On Wednesday and Thursday, the inverter provided a semblance of normality. We scrimped on the use of water and lights (fans were put on hold to save battery), but on Friday, both ran out.After a major struggle, we got through to CESC to register a complaint, preserving the docket number as one would a treasure. On Saturday, the water ran out. Residents managed to get workers to fell trees that were dangling ominously. In 72 hours, neither the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, nor CESC’s tree-cutting unit, had visited the area. But now their job has been done, thanks to the initiative of the residents themselves.We have two octogenarians at home who are putting on a brave front, but the unending, sleepless nights and tedious wait in dark evenings, matching wits with indefatigable mosquitoes, has begun to take a toll. Even hospitals are no longer a refuge, most of them being Covid-19 zones. Amphan has effectively put coronavirus in the shade. Without water, even the hand-washing ritual we are now accustomed to has had to be shelved.We managed to procure drinking water at a price, by word of mouth, since the phones do not work in the area. Internet is a far cry. Another passing vendor helped tote up buckets of water.In desperation, I called the CESC control room, which miraculously answered. The docket number given, the voice at the other end asked me to be patient a “little longer” — maybe tomorrow the transformers that have been damaged in the area will be repaired, he said. Till now, not a single CESC van has been in sight, neither any proactive move by the local councillor of Ward 109.Hope has begun to ebb. We are getting quite used to living like campers, minus any picturesque surroundings. Whatever green cover we cherished has been replaced by stubbles of tree trunks, reminiscent of the havoc the cyclone unleashed on this city. Thank you, CESC and CMC, for taking us back half a century.Sudipta Bhattacharjee is a journalist with The Telegraph",2020-05-23 21:12:00
639,Kinsuk Basu,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Power-cut impact on drugs - Telegraph India,"Refrigerators are not working in many medicine stores for want of electricity and this could impact the supply of critical drugs, store owners have said.Injections like insulin of various categories, reconstituted antibiotics, vaccines and some nebuliser solutions need refrigeration, they have said.“The efficacy of some of these drugs might be altered if they are not preserved at specified temperatures,” Manik Das, the secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association, said. “Several shop owners have been receiving calls from customers over the past few days asking for such medicines. They have had to refuse because they don’t have a power back-up.”It is likely that these drugs would have had a change in their chemical structures because refrigerators haven’t been working for almost four days, many pharmacists said on Saturday.Shop owners in Behala, Bansdroni, Jadavpur, Anandapur, Bowbazar and Sinthee said they had stored more than the usual stock of medicines in refrigerators fearing disruption because of the lockdown.“The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, doesn’t allow the shifting of such medicines,” Satyajit Das, a medicine shop owner in Behala, said. “I had assured my customers that there won’t be any problem. Now, I can’t give them the medicines because they have not been under refrigeration.”Several owners feared such medicines, including some eye and ear drops, might have to be discarded even if power is restored in a day or two.Hardly 30 per cent of medicine shops were open in the wholesale markets (Bagree market and Mehta Building) on Saturday.Most traders said members of their staff could not reach the stores after battling power cuts and flooded streets back home.“Medicine supply will start getting streamlined from Tuesday when the wholesale markets start running fully,” Chandresh B. Sanghvi, secretary, Calcutta Wholesale Medicine Market Committee, said.",2020-05-23 21:18:00
641,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Kolkata schools bear brunt of storm - Telegraph India,"School campuses have been affected by Cyclone Amphan. Over a dozen trees have been uprooted in one institution while the main gate of another has been damaged.At St James’ School, the signboard has been ripped off and over a dozen trees have been uprooted. “During Aila, a couple of trees had been uprooted but the extent of damage was not this severe. Regarding the lab equipment and the computer rooms, we will be able to assess the damage only after the school reopens,” Terence Ireland, the principal of St James’, said.At Calcutta Boys’ School, trees crashed on the main gate and damaged a portion of it. The boundary wall of the field has been damaged after a tree fell on it.Some of the newer schools like The Newtown School and South City International School have also borne the brunt of Amphan.At South City International, six palm trees have been uprooted and a portion of the boundary wall has been damaged after a tree fell on it.The façade of The Newtown School has been damaged as some of the structures were blown away in the storm. In the rooftop volleyball court, the steel structure has been damaged.In some schools, windowpanes have been smashed and in some, frames have come off the hinges. Some campuses have been flooded by rainwater.Some school heads said it was difficult to get labourers during the lockdown. A complete assessment of the damage will take more time, they said.“We will require manpower to get things in order. Also, we have no broadband, phone or Internet connections,” Raja McGee, principal of Calcutta Boys’, said.Board exams have been scheduled for July and schools have to complete repairs by then.“Some of the repairs like that of the volleyball court will take time. It will have to be dismantled and reinstalled,” Sunil Agarwal, founder-director of The Newtown School, said.",2020-05-23 21:21:00

But never mind, we shall apply our body, mind and soul together to see the smile in the face of our unfortunate sisters and brothers of Bengal,” Swami Suvirananda said in a message. “We know funds will never be wanting for this great cause.”Senior monks said the order had already started providing temporary shelter, cooked food and dry ration to the people affected by the storm and the operation would be scaled up.",2020-05-23 21:22:00
645,PTI,Kolkata stares at rise in pollution levels due to green cover loss: Environmentalists - Telegraph India,"Calcutta is staring at a rise in pollution levels post-lockdown due to uprooting of thousands of trees in the city by cyclone Amphan, environmentalists said.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has said that over 5,000 trees, several of which are over 50 years old, have been uprooted. Environmentalists, however, have put the number at 10,000.The trees, which absorb carbon emissions, had played a significant role in improving the air quality in the city during the lockdown.'More than a third of the roadside trees in the city seem to have been wiped out. We foresee a serious rise in PM 2.5 levels from the first week of September, when an estimated eight lakh vehicles will hit the roads post-lockdown,' environmentalist Somendra Nath Ghosh said.An official of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board said that trees will have to be planted on a large scale during the coming monsoon season.'We will launch a plantation drive once things settle down. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also called for plantation of trees to restore the green cover,' member of KMC's board of administrators and former mayor-in-council (Parks), Debashis Kumar said.But first, the uprooted trees have to be removed on an urgent basis and the job is being done on a war footing, he said.'Ten trees will need to be planted to compensate for the loss of one fully-grown tree. This is the standard practice,' he said.Around 200 trees were uprooted in the Rabindra Sarobar area itself, Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) executive engineer Sudhin Nandy said.KMDA, custodian of the Rabindra Sarobar Lake, will replant at least 100 of the fallen trees, he said.The extremely severe cyclone has also damaged the world's largest banyan tree in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden in Howrah's Shibpur, Botanical Survey of India scientist Shiv Kumar said.Many other trees in the botanical garden have been uprooted, an official of the establishment said.'We are yet to assess the total damages. We will see which trees can be replanted and where planting saplings of the same species will be required,' he added.",2020-05-24 05:04:00
646,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan amid coronavirus lockdown: Kolkata in hot pursuit of power repairmen - Telegraph India,"If “CESC” has become the most sought after   name in the city, desperation is driving Calcutta neighbourhoods to unparalleled lengths in their effort to catch hold of linesmen.At Suryanagar in Bansdroni on Sunday morning, a group of CESC workers were repairing cables, surrounded by a group of residents who had not had power over the past four days.Yards away, a knot of Calcuttans had formed another ring. They were from an adjoining neighbourhood, Pallishree, keeping vigil so that they could ensure the linesmen accompanied them to their locality instead of being hijacked by some other desperate group bereft of power.“We are all camping here so we can catch hold of them,” homemaker Gouri Kanjilal said, pointing at the CESC team.In Lake Gardens on Saturday, a middle-aged woman was grateful and gracious enough to offer snacks to the CESC workers but not before she had taken the universal precaution of grabbing the ignition key from their pick-up.She tied the key to her sari-end and kept it with her for several hours till late Saturday afternoon, that is, until the repairmen had fixed the lines.“She offered them biscuits and tea. But the keys were with her till the job was done,” an eyewitness said.Scenes of linesmen being chased, cajoled, detained and released from captivity only after the mission has been accomplished have been playing out across a city shaken by the aftershocks of the cyclone.In both tree removal —often a prerequisite for power cable repairs — and the restoration of electricity, there was visible improvement on the ground on Sunday. Several teams of tree cutters, including some from the army, were at work.The state home department tweeted the names of several places where power had been restored.“CESC today informed the state government that power was restored in Jadavpur, Selimpur, Mukundapur, Survey Park, Patuli, Regent Estate, NSC Bose Road, Behala Chowrasta, James Long Sarani, Silpara, Lake Town, Jessore Road, Nagerbazar, Rashbehari Connector, BB Chatterjee Road (1/2),” the tweet said.(A resident of the main Survey Park told this newspaper at 9.30pm on Sunday that her home was without power for the fifth consecutive evening. She said the army had on Sunday cleared the area of fallen trees, some of which had already been cut down by workers hired by the residents.)“(The state-run) WBSEDCL today informed the state government that power was restored in Garia, Bansdroni, Kestopur, Baguiati, Teghoria, Salt Lake, New Town, Barasat, Tamluk, Egra, Contai, Krishnanagar, Santipur, Ranaghat, Gayespur and Kalyani (1/2), Sonarpur, Baruipur, Rajpur, Narendrapur, Kakdwip and Namkhana,” the home department tweet added.A bus stop away from Suryanagar, in Netaji Nagar Colony, a five-member CESC team that was about to move on after an inspection was held inside a club building from Sunday morning.Some of the residents said the five would be set free once power returned. “We have not misbehaved with them. We just want them to restore the power connection,” said Arunabha Basu.Basu’s neighbour Ashis Das said “boys from the adjoining Sanghati Colony” had come and taken away two of the five personnel.“This triggered tension among the residents of the two colonies but both sides had reason to act in such desperation; CESC must mobilise more men,” Das said.CESC has said that several of its staff had gone home to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh because of the virus-fuelled lockdown and have been unable to return at short notice.At Suryanagar, scores of residents, wearing masks because of the Covid-19 threat, had assembled on Sunday morning around the point where the CESC workers had raised their ladder to disentangle cables from an uprooted radhachura tree.No one was allowed to pass through the lane lest their movement disrupt the pace of work.“It would not be proper to disturb them. Please wait,” Jignesh, who identified himself only by his first name, was heard telling a young man on a bike.For the Pallishree group, it was a long vigil. Standing a few feet from Gauri, Pradip Majumder said they were taking turns keeping watch. “We cannot afford to lose sight of the workers,” he said.The CESC team, which had started on the job on Saturday, worked till 3pm on Sunday to restore power in Suryanagar.From Suryanagar, they were whisked away to Pallishree, which had its power restored by 6pm.A doctor in the Rathtala area of NSC Bose Road was left wondering whether her side of the road was paying the price for not protesting on the streets.“The houses on the opposite side of the road had their supply restored today but ours haven’t. They had agitated yesterday; we only made a formal complaint. Perhaps that’s why,” the doctor said.",2020-05-24 20:53:00
647,Sanjay Mandal,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Power cuts leads to medical woes around the state - Telegraph India,"Prolonged power  cuts and lack of telephone network in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan have crippled homecare for the elderly, leading to stress and panic which,  in turn, are triggering complaints of illness.A number of elderly people had to be hospitalised after they complained of uneasiness induced by stress and panic, said doctors and homecare providers.An elderly woman from Lake Town, who has hypertension and diabetes and also suffers from a renal disease, passed out on Friday and had to be admitted to hospital.“The blood sodium level had dropped, probably because of excessive sweating. Her condition is stable and she will be discharged soon,” said a doctor who treated her at a private hospital off Bypass.A man who lives on Prince Anwar Shah Road said power supply to his house was disrupted on Wednesday evening and was restored only on Saturday evening.“My father-in-law, who is almost 80 and has a cardiac stent implanted, started having panic attacks from Friday. Almost every 10 minutes, he was asking me and my wife whether anybody has contacted CESC and what were they doing about it,” said the man, who works in a private sector company.“As hours passed and power was not restored, he became more restless and we were worried,” he said.Anxiety and worries were leading to restlessness and panic attacks, said doctors.There were also worries about vital medicines like insulin, which need to be stored below a certain temperature, getting damaged because refrigerators were not functioning in many houses in the absence of power.“Our care providers had to request pharmacies in neighbourhoods who have inverter sets to store insulin of many such patients till the power was restored at their homes,” said Mou Roy, the director of Rising Care, a home healthcare agency.At some households, where elderly people need oxygen support throughout the year because of conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, long hours of power cuts meant devices becoming non-functional.Oxygen concentrator, a device that concentrates the oxygen drawn from the air, cannot function without power. Most of those in need of the device keep oxygen cylinders as back-up. “Those who did not have oxygen cylinders were calling us up to know how to hire them,” said a healthcare agency.“The panic and anxiety were mainly because of two reasons — power outage for long hours, which caused severe discomfort and stress, and lack of connectivity, especially for the elderly staying alone who could not get in touch with their children,” said physician Amitabha Saha.Apollo Home Healthcare received several such distress calls over the past four days, said its officials.“Counsellors taking the calls had to reassure the callers, who were worried what would happen to them if the power was not restored soon. They were also worried about not being able to connect with their children,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, the unit head of Apollo Home Healthcare in Calcutta.Bhattacharya said connectivity issue also severely affected telemedicine, a facility many people opted for after the lockdown had been imposed to tackle the spread of the novel coronavirus.According to him, the company’s call centre in Hyderabad received about 50 calls from Calcutta in a day but doctors could not be contacted for consultation.“The doctors were not available over the phone. The callers were asked to visit hospitals if there was an emergency,” said Bhattacharya.Most people wanted to consult doctors because they were running a temperature or having diarrhoea, or suffering from stress caused by long hours of power outage.Private hospitals failed to provide ambulances in many cases because roads were blocked by uprooted trees.“There were requests for nurses and paramedics but we could not send them because vehicles could not move,” the CEO of a private hospital said.“We had to conduct dialysis of at least three Covid-19 patients without even verbal consent from relatives because the phones were not reachable,” said an official of a private hospital.",2020-05-24 21:55:00
648,Our Special Correspondent,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Kolkata flights deferred to Thursday - Telegraph India,"Domestic flights are resuming across the country on Monday but in Calcutta they have been deferred till Thursday following a request from the state government in view of Cyclone Amphan.Calcutta was to have seen more than 150 flights take off and land on Monday. Airlines now have to redraw their schedule.The civil aviation ministry held a meeting on Sunday and decided to defer flight operations in and out of Calcutta and Bagdogra to May 28.Late on Sunday evening, the airlines were holding a video conference with officials of the directorate general of civil aviation to revise the flight schedule across the country because Calcutta’s flights were not operating, sources said.Those who had booked tickets on flights to and from Calcutta on May 25, 26 and 27 would be able to use them on other dates in a specified period, officials of airlines said.“We have informed the airlines that flights would operate from May 28. They have to prepare fresh schedules,” said Kaushik Bhattacharya, the director of the Calcutta airport.He said about 80 fights were scheduled to take off from Calcutta on Monday and a similar number was to land here.But several airlines said they were planning to reduce the number of Calcutta flights when they resume operations  from the city because there is not much demand.SpiceJet officials said they had planned to operate 25-odd flights from Calcutta on Monday but the count can go down to less than 20.  IndiGo sources, too, said they would not operate the number of flights they were planning to.“There are some demands in the northeast sector and the flights there could have 80 per cent occupancy. But in other sectors, it would not be more than 50 per cent,” said an official of a private airline.Metro reported on Sunday that chief minister Mamata Banerjee would request the Centre to operate domestic flights to Calcutta and Bagdogra from May 30 and May 28, respectively.The request was made because the state was busy handling the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan. “We will get afew more days to handle the situation. We are fighting three battles together — disaster, corona and sending migrant workers home,” Mamata had said.",2020-05-24 21:57:00
650,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Bamboo pole hope to restore power in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Bamboo poles have to be installed as an ad-hoc measure to take forward electric cables that were tied around fallen poles to restore power supply, civic officials said on Sunday.The officials said erecting metal poles would take months.A senior official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the option of using bamboo poles was discussed in internal meetings over the last couple of days after officials realised the enormity of the damage Cyclone Amphan inflicted on the power supply infrastructure.Restoring the fallen electric poles could take months, an official said.“We cannot wait for days for power supply to be restored. So, the bamboo poles can be used as alternatives. Electric cables can be tied around bamboo poles to take the cables forward,” said the official.He said Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the board of administrators of the CMC, spoke about the need to do something immediately.Bamboo poles can also be a solution for the 4,000-odd lamp posts that have fallen across the city. A CMC official said that unless something ad-hoc was done, large stretches of the city’s roads would remain dark for months to come.The corporation on Sunday was also struggling to restore water supply to many places in Tollygunge, Jadavpur and Behala, which are dependant on deep tubewells.The tube wells need electricity to work. As power supply is unavailable in many of these places, they cannot be operated.“There are many parts of Calcutta where potable water still does not reach. Deep-diameter tube wells that run on electricity pump water from underground and supply it to houses. But that has stopped,” said a civic official.He said five generators had been put to use on Sunday to make some tube wells operational but still a lot more remain defunct.“We are looking for more generators to run more tube wells,” said the official.",2020-05-24 22:01:00
651,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: St. Xavier's help in ravaged district - Telegraph India,"Hundreds of residents of a South 24 Parganas pocket, battered by Amphan, are getting drinking water from St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), which runs a campus in the area.Most students at the St Xavier’s Raghabpur campus are from underprivileged families. Sons of daily wage agriculture labourers, they are first-generation learners.The campus had given shelter to many families in the neighbourhood on Wednesday evening, when the storm was ravaging South 24 Parganas. Many homes in the area have been destroyed. There is no power and drinking water at many homes.“As a part of our Jesuit values in St. Xavier’s, we are committed to the holistic well being and development of our students and always want to see that they are taken care of even outside the institution, especially in this hour of crisis. The students and our neighbours should feel assured that at this trying time, the college along with our alumni association, is with the students in particular and the local community in general,” said Father Dominic Savio, the principal of the college.“The area remained powerless and without supply of drinking water till Sunday. We are providing drinking water to the residents of the locality. The college is also proving power to the local people to charge their mobile phones,” said Firdausul Hasan of the the St. Xavier's College Calcutta Alumni Association, which had organised the relief. Storm of 1864The 75th edition of St Xavier’s Magazine in 1935 had a piece on a “terrific cyclone in 1864 in Calcutta”. Excerpts from the description follow.  ‘On October 5, a terrific cyclone shook Calcutta; life and property were at its mercy, and a frightful destruction was the work of its fury. The College suffered in the general devastation. Doors and windows were torn from their hinges and dashed to pieces. A sunny morning dawned on a ghastly scene; “ houses wrecked, steeples destroyed, steamers disabled or sunk, hundreds of native boats cast ashore in hopeless plight, a three master stranded in the Eden Gardens, and thousands of corpses floating in the river oceanwards. The damage was immense, 25 crores for Calcutta alone. It was estimated that in Bengal and near Masulipatam, where a tidal wave swept over the land, 100,000 people had been drowned or killed.”   The college was a major sufferer in the tragedy. “But Father Depelchin rose to the occasion. He appealed to a generous public and went about begging and mainly through his efforts new buildings saw the light of day,” said Father Felix Raj, vice-chancellor of St. Xavier’s University.",2020-05-24 22:05:00
652,Kinsuk Basu,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Tools that cleared roads of trees - Telegraph India,"Army teams have been deployed across Calcutta to cut uprooted trees and remove them from roads.The Telegraph on Sunday watched from close quarters the work of a joint team of the Kumaon Regiment, 71 Engineers Regiment and National Disaster Response Force in pockets of south Calcutta. Officers involved in the operations said it should take between 10 and 15 minutes to cut to pieces an uprooted full-grown tree. Some of the equipment used by the teamChainsaw cutterA portable saw-cutting machine that has a series of teeth fitted on a chain that keeps revolving with the help a machine. This machine runs on petrol and can work without electricity. There were two varieties of chainsaw cutters—one 23 inch long and the other 18 inch long.“Since this saw cutter is machine driven, it works fast. Unfortunately, most of the trees here have wet trunks. If they were dry, we would have cut through them even faster,” said a member of the Kumaon Regiment.  This gadget weighs around 7.5kg and the machine has a horsepower of 3.35.PayloaderA payloader was brought in to remove huge tree trunks and fallen branches. The payloader engine was of 92 horsepower and the machine had a pair of strong legs on which it could be mounted. Horsepower is a measurement of the ability to produce power. Domestic water pumps have power that ranges between 0.5 to 2 horsepower.Payloaders used on Sunday had the ability to dig into a depth of 5.05m inside the ground. “In such a disaster you need a powerful backhoe so that tree trunks can be removed fasterfrom blocked thoroughfares once the trunks have been cut,” said Captain Vikram Dhane, of the Engineers Regiment. “Without such powerfulf payloaders, one would end up spending lot of time in cutting and pruning.”Hand-held manual sawsThis tool has wider and longer panels than the ones commonly used. Officers said the longer the distance between the head and the toe of a saw, the greater the number of teeth. This makes cutting through a surface faster.  Wire cutterLong-handled cutters were brought in to remove cables and wires that remained entangled with tree trunks and branches. Once a payloader cleared a thoroughfare of trees, these were used to cut cables and wires so that vehicles didn’t face obstruction in moving through.ChoppersThey were of two varieties. One with a small head and a long handle and the other are shorter ones. The long-handle ones (in picture) were used to complete the task of cutting down a branch that had been partly sawed through with a chain cutter or a hand-held saw. The shorter ones were used on smaller branches and thin wires that came in the way of a chainsaw cutter",2020-05-24 22:06:00
653,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 100km on cycle to Namkhana for kids - Telegraph India,"A man cycled close to 100km from Behala to Namkhana, near the spot where Cyclone Amphan had made landfall, because he could not contact his children back home after the storm.Gopal Bhuniya, a cook at a fast-food centre in Behala’s Bakultala, left his rented accommodation near the joint around 4.30am on Friday. He lives with his wife Nomita, a domestic help.He reached Debnagar, his village some 7km from Namkhana, around 11am to find his village home almost razed to the ground but his children — 19-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son — and septuagenarian mother are safe.Namkhana, one of the last land points before the Sagar Island, is 102km from central Calcutta.The last time Nomita had spoken to her daughter — a final-year student of education (honours) at Namkhana College — was around 2pm on Wednesday, 30 minutes before the cyclone struck Sagar Island, 35km from Namkhana.Sushama had spoken from a relative’s three-storey house in the same village. The network was patchy. “She had just seen the tiled roof of our house flying in the air when the connection snapped,” Nomita said.For the next 38 hours, the couple tried calling their children and neighbours hundreds of times, but in vain.On Thursday night, they decided Gopal would go home. They sounded a private taxi driver who demanded Rs 3,000 for a one-way trip even if the trip remained incomplete because of fallen trees and inaccessible roads.They ruled out the taxi and Gopal left for Namkhana by 4.30am.“I was worried for him. But the anxiety was killing us,” Nomita said.Around 9.30pm on Friday, her daughter’s friend and her brother came to the Bhuniyas’ rented accommodation in Behala to connect Sushama with her mother.The conversation lasted barely a minute before the connection snapped again. “The house is almost gone. But we are all safe. Baba is here. You don’t worry,” Nomita quoted her daughter as saying.Nomita said she had assumed that phone calls from and to Namkhana would not be possible. “I was almost certain that I would not get to know the fate of my children, good or bad.”Sushama had been staying with her parents in Behala since her college classes were over and she had taken up a teacher’s job at the Behala branch of a pre-school. She had returned to Debnagar just before the lockdown.Her friend, who works at the same pre-school, had received her call on her brother’s phone. His was the only number that she could connect after trying all her acquaintances in Calcutta.“She had cycled to a place, around 2km from our village, after hearing that the area had some semblance of network,” Nomita said.Sushama met her father on Friday and wanted to tell her mother that they were safe. She requested her friend to “somehow take her brother’s phone” to Nomita and said she would call after 40 minutes to speak to her.",2020-05-24 22:09:00
655,Sudeshna Banerjee,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Volunteers bridge communication gap in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"When Subhoroop Ghosh reached the Majumdars at Srinagar colony, Panchasayar, the elderly couple had spent 48 hours without electricity and desperately needed to be ferried to a relative’s house in Dhakuria. “Their daughter-in-law in Pune had called me. Their phone was not working but I found the house and booked them an Uber,” said Ghosh.Rounak Dey got a call from California seeking news of a family in Baranagar. “The address was 15 minutes away from my place. I could make the couple speak to their daughter on my phone,” he said.With communication crashing post-Amphan, people out of town have lost touch with their families back home. And reports of devastation in Calcutta have left them worried about their well-being. Some good samaritans are now offering to visit strangers amid the lockdown and bring their news to their families.It started with Swati Moitra, a Gurudas College teacher, tweeting an offer on Thursday to look up elderly parents for out-of-town children who were unable to contact them. “In Salt Lake, power was restored after the cyclone though phone lines remained dodgy. It struck me that our township being an elderly hub, many would be trying to contact their parents and failing,” said the AD Block resident.The tweet was noticed by Shreyasi Talukdar of Patuli who brought it up during an online chat with her friend Sreyashi Dastidar from Bangalore, who herself was trying to connect with her family in Behala, where power supply had not been restored. “She suggested that we scale up the service Moitra was offering and find more volunteers,” Talukdar said.As part of the group Humans of Patuli, she and her friends like Sudeshna Duttagupta were already supplying weekly rations to the local slums. “After the cyclone, we added this to our services,” said Duttagupta, a Sanskrit College student. So a volunteer list was floated online, asking others to add their names and preferred area of help. The first night’s list of 11 volunteers has increased to 41, from areas as far-flung as Baranagar and Barasat. “People have joined from Krishnanagar and Bally too,” Moitra said.Most queries are coming for addresses in Behala and Narendrapur. “Some requests we are failing to keep, like for a power bank or for drinking water. We are also looking for volunteers in Barrackpore,” Moitra  added.",2020-05-24 22:13:00
656,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Power back in several parts of the city: 12.5% truth - Telegraph India,"The state government had tweeted on Sunday, quoting a CESC report, that power supply was restored to several parts of Calcutta, including Regent Estate in Jadavpur.On Monday, residents of Regent Estate told The Telegraph that only 25 of the 200-odd houses had the supply restored.“We read in newspapers that power supply was back in most parts of our area. But most households are still without electricity,” said Shibaji Bhowmik, the secretary of the Regent Estate Association.A visit to the neighbourhood revealed that uprooted poles were still lying along or on the roads. Cables that had invaded balconies during the storm were not removed and passages were still blocked by  uprooted trees.A resident said most of the 3,500-odd residents stay in multi-storey buildings. Many elderly people were severely inconvenienced.“We have to hire generator sets for emergency purposes like getting potable water from the reservoir on the ground to that on the roof. Many people who are diabetic have to keep their insulin in refrigerators,” said Sudip Das Bhowmik, a septuagenarian.On Monday afternoon, a group of residents was seen dragging power cables from the CESC office next to KPC Medical College and Hospital in Jadavpur.A middle-aged person, who was part of the team, said they did so because CESC staff said they did not have enough personnel for the job.“We went to the office, collected the cable and brought it to Regent Estate on our own. We just want a CESC team to come and fix the lines,” said the person.Regent Estate is not the lone case where the state government has made claims that turned out to be false.The government tweeted that power had been restored to major parts of Survey Park as well. A resident of Survey Park told this newspaper at 9.30pm on Sunday that her home was without power for the fifth consecutive evening.On Monday, power was restored to her house, but not to a large number of houses spread over the three blocks of Survey Park.Residents of Regent Estate said they went to the local CESC office several times with the plea to repair the lines.“On Thursday, the linemen said the fallen trees would have to be cleared to make way for them. We hired tree cutters to create the passage. But only a handful of persons came and fixed fewer lines than required,” said Ashok Sengupta.Rajeshwar Sinha, a teacher at Jadavpur University, said the fewer linemen on the ground were hijacked by residents of an adjoining colony.CESC officials were not available for comment. The company’s spokesperson neither took calls nor responded to a text message till late on Monday.",2020-05-25 20:53:00
658,Our Special Correspondent,La Martiniere parents protest order to buy bags - Telegraph India,"Many parents have complained that the La Martiniere schools are charging them for school bags along with books at a time when going to school is uncertain because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus.Traditionally parents have not been compelled to buy bags but this time they are, the parents alleged. Is it ethical for the school to make such demands during a year of “exceptional hardship”? a parent asked.More than a month into online classes, many parents have procured books. They want the liberty to choose which text books they want instead of being asked to buy the entire set.Many students of junior classes have unused exercise books left. Their parents said they should be allowed to buy exercise books only when their earlier ones have been exhausted.The lockdown has severely hurt the economy and many salaried employees have lost their jobs or are having to do with a reduced salary. Parents said they were struggling with expenses and any extra payment under the current circumstances would be taxing.Keeping in view the parents’ ordeal, the state government had asked private schools not to hike the fee this year and to be sympathetic to parents who would be unable to pay.Metro has reported that parents of most students of schools across the city are unable to pay the fees because of the economic slump that had started before the Covid-19 outbreak in India and was aggravated by the lockdown.Parents also fear that if a school like La Martiniere does something like this. it might set a trend for other schools to follow.“People are already struggling to make ends meet and we are borrowing old books. We might not want to buy the whole set... we should have the option to choose only the books we need to buy and not the whole set. Please minimise wastage, we should learn this. It’s high time now,” a parent said.The online order for books started on Monday and will continue till June 1, spread out across classes from upper nursery to Class XII. The school has said that the payment has to be made digitally and “directly to the vendor”.A parent who has ordered Class V books has written on the Facebook page of the schools: “School bag and a lot of stationery we do not require have been added in the set due to which the price has gone high. We were not given the option to omit these things... Kids need to learn to treasure what they have and learn to live with less material possession. New bag, new geometry box, new ruler etc is not required every year.”Another parent has written: “...Please as a policy let us try and sensitise our children and be responsible ourselves... instead of new covers and new stationery I would have wanted them to donate that money to those who have lost everything... if we don’t do this now (being part of the small segment of the privileged lot of this state.. even after seeing the havoc around us) then When?”The school told The Telegraph that each institution has rules that should be followed.“The bag is part of the school uniform with a school logo, which parents are being asked to buy. Every institution has rules and parents are expected to follow them,” said Supriyo Dhar, the secretary of the schools.He added the price of the bag was not unusually high.“As for the books, we are not forcing parents or saying that they have to buy. They can choose to buy on their own as well. Buying the entire set is not something new this year and a practice the school has followed over the years for the convenience of parents. The school is not involved in any monetary transactions and the entire payment is being made to the vendor by the parent,” said Dhar.Buy list (For a student of Class V)",2020-05-25 21:00:00
660,Pinak Ghosh,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Generator sets key to mobile link - Telegraph India,"Telecom services continue to stutter five days after Cyclone Amphan left Calcutta.One of the reasons is that power supply has yet to be restored to all the towers in the affected areas. Those with better coverage now had invested in back-up such as diesel generators which are keeping the towers functional.The following are some of the problems listed by some telecom service operators and telecom infrastructure companies, besides the power problem.For the past five days, thousands of people in the two 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly have not had any connection.A call from Gariahat to Beliaghata took 11 attempts on Monday spread over three hours to connect the users at either end.Connectivity got worse further from the city.People have not been able to reach their family or doctors for emergency consultations. Thousands have not been able to work from home.It is estimated that around 900 towers alone in Calcutta have been hit by the cyclone.“Network is back at about 80-85 per cent performance level as of Monday. DoT (Department of Telecommunication) has been informed that by tomorrow it will improve to 90-95 per cent. But erratic power supply is still a problem. Even if the network goes up to 95 per cent, with erratic power supply the problem persists. Moreover, there is network disruption on account of fibre cuts and certain areas are still inaccessible,” said Rajan Mathews, director general of the COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India).A Dover Terrace resident asked: “Why should wireless connection be so paralysed? Is it because the telcos don’t spend enough on building infrastructure?”“As of now, the situation of power supply in Calcutta has improved. But it will take a while for electricity to get stable. Diesel gensets, batteries and field rescue teams are kept in readiness. We have also requested DoT to help us with availability of diesel in some areas like North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and East Midnapore,” said T.R. Dua of the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association.“We are working under extremely tough conditions and amid Covid related restrictions to restore connectivity,” said a Vodafone Idea official.",2020-05-25 21:11:00
662,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Three sites identified to dump trees in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has identified three places where the 5,000-odd trees that fell across the city will be dumped, officials said on Tuesday.Trees that fell in south and west Calcutta will be transported to an open ground opposite Nature Park, near Taratala. Those that fell in north Calcutta will be taken to Tallah Park. The ground where vehicles used to be parked for fairs at Milan Mela has been identified for fallen trees from east and parts of south Calcutta.The CMC has also hired equipment like payloaders, cranes and dumpers to pick up  parts of uprooted trees.A CMC official said on Monday evening the civic authorities had by Monday chopped all trees that blocked thoroughfares.“We have been able to chop off the fallen trees and cut them into smaller pieces. But most of the chopped-off portions are still lying by the roadside, because of which the roads are again getting blocked partially,” the official said.The CMC has over 30 payloaders. It is hiring 10 more payloaders and as many dumper trucks and telescopic cranes. CMC officials said they would use some of their solid waste management department’s fleet and also hire trucks to transport the trees and their branches.“Payloaders and dumper trucks will speed up the process of removing trees,” an official said.",2020-05-25 21:17:00
664,Subhajoy Roy,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Post-storm, beware of the hazards - Telegraph India","Calcutta’s cyclone-scarred roads have dangers lurking in every corner.Perilously suspended electric poles, hanging tree branches, mesh of cables lying across a road or hanging close to the ground and hoardings that came loose while Amphan was barrelling through the city have made walking or driving dangerous.Urban designers said a situation like this would not have happened if the overhead cables were not allowed to be hung around poles and trees were cared for, instead of pruning them unscientifically.Rickety hoardings, too, should not have been allowed to stand anywhere in the city, they said. The civic administration’s apathy has allowed the situation like this to come to pass, they added.Under the impact of the cyclone, poles and trees toppled like cards. The loose ends of hoardings and their steel frames can easily turn into missiles if they are hit by strong winds.An urban designer said most hoardings in Calcutta have been put up without a good structural design. Proper design is important as that can ensure that the steel frames are robust and can withstand strong gusts of wind.“A hoarding that is cast inside a building’s wall will not collapse easily but a standalone hoarding is more likely to collapse because the structure will have to take the entire thrust of the wind. That is why a proper structural design is very important,” said Debatosh Sahu, a fellow of the Institute of Urban Designers of India.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has an advertisement department but it rarely checks the engineering or the structural design of a standalone hoarding. “The department’s main function is to earn revenue for the civic body,” a CMC official said.Sahu said if the steel framework was not robust, it was unlikely to withstand strong winds.The problem with the city’s trees is somewhat similar, felt naturalists. The CMC prunes trees before every monsoon, but the pruning is done very casually and without trying to maintain any balance among all sides of the tree.“There is no proper supervision. The side that is easily accessible is readily pruned. But the other side is never trimmed. As a result, the side where branches are not pruned become heavier,” said naturalist Arjan Basu Roy. During strong winds, trees topple on the heavier side.CMC engineers have admitted that cables hanging from a pole make it unstable, increasing the risk of toppling. “If there is only the pole standing, winds pass by its two sides. But when cables hang from a pole, the wind gets blocked by the wire mesh and that puts the pole under greater stress,” a CMC engineer said.Another designer pointed out that New Town was an example in contrast. There is no advertising panel with steel frames and the street lights do not have any overhead cable hanging from them.“We do not allow advertising on the Main Arterial Road. Even in the lanes off the arterial road, there are very stringent rules in place, a reason why advertisements are almost non-existent in the city,” said an official of New Town Kolkata Development Authority.",2020-05-25 21:31:00

He had planned to inaugurate the store on Id.The 28-year-old’s family started their Id prayers on Monday with a visit to the burial ground in Gobra where Alam was interred four days ago.Alam’s family is into the tailoring business but he wanted to set up his own garments store in the Park Circus area, according to his family members.On Wednesday, Alam had just completed his evening prayers as the cyclone raged outside. A resident of Noor Ali Lane in Park Circus, Alam had rushed to his store in the adjacent building to save some garments lying on the floor from getting wet in the rainwater, a family member said.“Ours is a low-lying area and gets flooded even in little rain. That day, water had started seeping into Alam’s store. He had completed his prayers and he stepped out in the cyclone to remove the garments, which were lying on the floor,” his uncle, Shamsher Alam, said. “The shop was being readied for inauguration.”Alam was lifting the shutter of his store when he lost his balance in the raging wind and banged his head in the shutter of the adjacent shop, a doctor’s chamber, his uncle said.“The chamber’s signboard had come off… possibly the board’s wires, which were jutting out, had come in contact with the shutter…. Alam was electrocuted the moment his head hit the shutter,” another family member said.He was taken to hospital where doctors told the family that he might have lived had his brain not been affected, the family member said.Alam, survived by his parents, two sisters and a brother, had interests that ranged from tailoring to cricket. He had graduated from a city college.His father Tauqir Alam has a tailoring business but he wanted to get a store of his own. He had been doing online business of garments to earn some money for his store.“He had planned a grand opening on Id. He was disappointed that work on the false ceiling had to be stopped because of the lockdown. But he was still excited to start off,” his uncle whose restaurant is opposite Alam’s new store said.On Monday morning, as the city celebrated Id, the Alam family started their day with a visit to the Gobra burial ground.Tauqir Alam’s brothers, their families and other relatives were at the burial ground.“This is an Id we will never forget in our lives. We went to meet our child whom we had left there four days ago… the first thing in the morning,” Shamsher Alam said.",2020-05-25 22:06:00
668,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Behala residents hijack CESC team to restore power supply - Telegraph India,"This is what it took for power to be restored in a Behala neighbourhood — and accounts from different parts of Calcutta suggest it was not an isolated incident.The Behala pocket, with most homes without power since Wednesday and some since Thursday, had its supply restored on Sunday evening after a group of residents hijacked a CESC team, shielded it from rival groups and stood guard as long as the linesmen were on the job.The residents of Wards 125, 126, 127 and 128 had blocked Biren Roy Road (West), a busy street connecting Diamond Harbour Road with areas like Bakultala, Sarsuna and Shakuntala Park, for hours on Saturday and Sunday.Apart from a sizeable presence of women, the group had several middle-aged men and a few elderly ones.The group that hijacked the CESC team on Sunday morning included at least two women.The operation reminded one of the group members — a 50-year-old football and East Bengal fan — of an equally surcharged hijacking in 1993, when the red-and-gold brigade had snatched a player from under Mohun Bagan’s nose during the transfer season.The football fan was part of the group that waited for Steel Express — the player was coming from Jamshedpur — in Howrah and managed to sneak him past the Mohun Bagan men who were also vying for him. Cut to 2020. A team from the CESC had turned up to repair damaged overhead wires on Biren Roy Road (West) late on Friday night. But a group from another neighbourhood, also without power, arrived at the spot and hijacked the team, a resident of Bakultala said.“They easily outnumbered us,” said the man, who was in his early 50s. “But the incident put us on our toes.”Two local clubs sprang into action the next day and at least 50 people started blocking the road. Some “informers” were deputed at nearby areas to keep track of CESC teams.As soon as a tip-off came on Sunday about a power restoration team working in Sakherbazar, around a kilometre from Behala Chowrasta, a group of “around 15 men and two women” rushed to the spot.“When we reached the spot around 11.30am, the CESC team had almost completed its work there,” said a resident of Basudevpur Main Road, part of the squad.But a group from another neighbourhood was waiting to take the CESC team away.Things got “charged up” and members of the rival groups, some of them friends for years, were eyeball to eyeball for a while before a compromise was reached.“We reached a solution. It was decided that the CESC team would first come to Biren Roy Road (West) and fix the supply. A small team from Sanjib Palli would wait there and, once the job was done, lead the personnel to their locality,” said another resident.Deal done, the team came to work around 1pm. The group members took turns standing guard. The CESC workers were treated to a lunch of rice, dal, vegetables and fish cooked from a local eatery.Power was restored a little after 7pm.Another group from another locality arrived at the scene to take the workers away. This time, the local group sided with the residents of Sanjib Palli. Another deal was struck. The CESC team would first go to Sanjib Palli, as originally decided, and then to the third location.The CESC team left Biren Roy Road (West) around 7.30pm.Food fundOn the eastern fringes of Calcutta, residents of a neighbourhood who had been without power for five days paid for “food and refreshments” for a team of workers who restored some of the connections.The local police station had cobbled the team together — with CESC workers drafted from other teams and six men from another agency — residents said.A team of four policemen from the local station accompanied the workers, possibly to thwart attempted kidnappings by other groups.When power returned to some of the homes on Monday afternoon, they were told this was a “temporary connection” and they had better not switch on ACs or geysers.A group of residents collected cash contributions of Rs 300 each from over 40 houses from three lanes in the block, which has over 150 houses.“Roder modhye sakal theke khatchhe. Oder jonno ektu khabarer byabastha korbo (They have been toiling in the sun since morning. We’ll arrange food for them),” a civil contractor who was raising the funds told a family, a resident said.Among the fundraisers were some who usually kept to themselves. “The common plight brought everyone together,” said a woman.“We had been badgering the officer in charge of the local police station for three days. He was extremely helpful,” said a resident who owns a garments store.The residents had resorted to a road blockade and multiple visits to a nearby CESC office, besides pleading with the cops. “A mobile van that the CESC office sent got hijacked by another group on Saturday,” said a resident.The team began working on Monday morning. A crowd gathered at the spot. People flocked to balconies and windows to watch the workers.In the evening, the group that had collected the money began knocking on the donors’ doors again — this time to return a part of the money. At least three families said they got back Rs 202 each.“We organised lunch, soft drinks and two rounds of tea. It took Rs 98 per house,” the contractor is said to have told the families. The team of cops on vigil were also provided with food and refreshments.The officer in charge of the police station, asked about his role in the restoration of power, tweeted: “Stitching (the team) done by CESC and restoration is the all-out effort of minister Aroop Biswas, local councillor and our department.”A CESC spokesperson said he “had no knowledge of the utility’s workers being provided with food”. But sources in the utility said it was “good to see” that the workers were being appreciated. “They have been toiling for 16 to 20 hours a day. Some appreciation is due,” said one of the sources.",2020-05-26 00:01:00

671,Mita Mukherjee,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal threatens to derail girl’s lone march through college - Telegraph India,"She is the only girl from the village of Ghorkhali, along the banks of the Matla river near Canning in South 24-Parganas, who has not dropped out and managed to continue her studies till college.Rozina Molla, 20, who is to write Calcutta University’s BA Part III exams, and younger brother Imran, also a college student, had tried their best to protect their books, class notes and all other belongings while Cyclone Amphan was flattening large swathes of south Bengal.But as the intensity of the cyclone increased, they lost all hope and were forced to run away to a nearby school that had been turned into a storm shelter, leaving behind all their belongings.When they returned home after two days, everything had been swept away. The asbestos roof of their one-room house was blown off and the siblings are somehow managing to stay there by placing a plastic sheet over the house.Rozina said she used to fund her studies by doing zari work that would fetch him Rs 100 to Rs 200 a week.She would travel one-and-a-half-hours each way to college — Bankim Sardar College, near Canning — and back home daily.The siblings had lost their father two years back. He died of heart attack when he was just 45. Their mother has not been keeping well, so they sent her to a relative’s house nearby, which is of concrete and hence more stable than theirs.“We have hardly seen good days... even when my father was alive. But we were a happy family. My father would always encourage us to study. After his death, my brother and I were about to drop out. But we did not. We worked hard so we could continue with our studies. But now, our books, class notes, exercise books, everything has been taken away by the storm,” Rozina told Metro over the phone from her village.“I had always cherished the dream to become a graduate. That dream has been shattered.”Ghorkhali has a population of around 2,500 and most of the residents are poor farmers and zari workers. A large number of girls and boys drop out before reaching Class X.She is worried because Calcutta University has recently announced that the BA, BSc, BCom Part III and the BCom final semester exams would be held a month after the colleges and the university reopens.The colleges are slated to reopen after June 10.Tilak Chatterjee, the principal of Bankim Sardar College, said nearly 400 of his students were from Canning, Gosaba, Basanti and Jharkhali, in the Sunderbans. Almost all are facing the same uncertainty as Rozina because of the devastation wreaked by Amphan. “We are trying to provide books and notes to as many students as possible,” said Chatterjee.Teachers of the college are in touch with Rozina to offer her as much help as possible.Prasenjit Samanta, one of the teachers of the college, said there was an inclination among people to stay back at their homes during a calamity till the last moment because they don’t want to part with the small house — that’s all they have.“Some students could have saved their books if they had shifted to safer places before the cyclone struck,” he said.",2020-05-26 21:31:00
672,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: ‘I have had enough’: Former teacher, 80, joins protest - Telegraph India","An 80-year-old former teacher sat in the middle of NSC Bose Road in Netajinagar on Tuesday because she thought every one should take to the streets to protest the failure to restore power even a week after Cyclone Amphan had struck Calcutta.“If the young in my area can protest, so can I. I waited all these days hoping power supply would be restored. But I have had enough,” said the former headmistress of Sishu Mahal Primary School in Netajinagar.The place where she was protesting is about 5km from the Tollygunge tram depot.A number of areas in the city have been without power since the cyclone struck on Wednesday evening.In some pockets where supply was restored through a temporary connection, power went off following a fresh glitch and that triggered a fresh wave of protest.“When you are forced to deal with such problems for days on end, protest seems the only way forward. Where is the administration? Is it too much to ask?” Mitra, who was a teacher for 42 years, said.A handkerchief wrapped around her face, Mitra said she “could not keep her cool” over what had been going on in her neighbourhood since Wednesday.She was among the protesters who blockaded the thoroughfare that connects Tollygunge with Garia. The residents had placed logs and branches of fallen trees to set up the blockade.Mitra said they had hoped that CESC would fix the lines and restore supply after a team from the Odisha fire and disaster services removed trees on the fallen cables on Monday.Teams from Odisha were engaged after workers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation failed to do the job.“But where are CESC people? Where are local leaders? Will they appear only after protest? Can they imagine what an elderly person like me goes through without power for six consecutive days,” said Mitra.She suffers from hypertension and does not have anyone else in her family. She said her condition had worsened because she had not been able to sleep for several days.Barely five yards away, on a tree trunk was seated Babita Dutta Majumder, Mitra’s neighbour.Mitra lives on the ground floor of a building close to the crossing of NSC Bose Road and Netajinagar and Babita lives on the first floor.Dutta Majumder, who was seated along with a group of women, wondered whether they were paying the price for not organising any demonstration so far.“We have been hearing stories about people squatting on roads to get supply restored. We did not do any such thing hoping CESC would do the needful. But the wait seems endless. I think we are paying the price for not protesting,” said Dutta Majumder.She said at a time when they were reeling under power cut, the government is claiming that supply had been restored to 90 per cent of the affected areas.“If that was the case, why people in different pockets of Netajinagar and Bansdroni are blocking the roads. Why is there no fact-checking before such claims are made?” said Dutta Majumder.The middle-aged woman was later seen mobilising a group of women to catch hold of a CESC team in Khanpur, a neighbourhood in Bansdroni.Chasing, cajoling and detaining CESC technicians have become a new normal in affected neighbourhoods. “We have to do the same thing. We are left with no choice,” said Babita.",2020-05-26 21:33:00
673,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Police norms to prevent hijack of CESC teams - Telegraph India,"In a south Calcutta neighbourhood, police on Tuesday tried to lay down the rules to be followed when a CESC team worked, while people from several power-less pockets waited to snatch the technicians away.In front of a building on Ashok Avenue, the officer-in-charge of Netajinagar police station was heard saying:Not that everyone was impressed, though they nodded their heads approvingly.“We are standing here not without any reason. We have grown desperate after waiting for power for six days,” said a resident.Subhas Adhikary, the OC, was making the announcements while a CESC team was inspecting a building on Ashok Avenue that did not have power since the Amphan struck on Wednesday.Residents of another building were seen waiting close-by and keeping a watch on what the linesmen were doing.Adhikary then accompanied the linesmen to another building of the area so they could carry out the primary inspection unhindered.An officer of the police station said Adhikary was keeping the linesmen under watch to neutralise chances of residents of some other neighbourhoods snatching them away.Barely 100m from the spot where Adhikary was making the announcement, some linesmen were detained inside a club on Sunday so that they could not be whisked away by residents of an adjoining colony.“This detention of linesmen by residents was putting them under more stress. Our OC was only trying to ensure that the job was done in a systematic way, considering that the workforce was limited in numbers compared with the scale of damage,” said the officer.Adhikary told Metro: “The residents have to understand that they must allow these men to work freely. They must cooperate.”Adhikary was also heard telling residents that even if supply was restored they must use the power sparingly.",2020-05-26 21:36:00
674,Sanjay Mandal, Coronavirus pandemic: 400-bed quarantine centre set up at Kolkata airport - Telegraph India,"A portion of the city airport’s old domestic terminal has been converted into a Covid-19 quarantine centre with around 400 beds.The beds have been placed in the erstwhile arrival area on the ground floor of the building.“The state government had requested for space to set up a quarantine centre. We are in the process of handing over the facility (to the state government),” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.The state government has set up 582 quarantine centres across Bengal. More than 18,000 people are now quarantined at these centres, health department officials said.The quarantine facility at the airport will be run for two months and the period could be extended if necessary, a state government official said.Several international flights are set to land in Calcutta in the next phase of the project to bring back Indians stuck abroad because of the lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus.On Wednesday, a flight carrying more than 100 passengers is scheduled to arrive in Calcutta under the Vande Bharat mission.One flight each from Yangon and Colombo are also scheduled to arrive, along with one from Dhaka, later.All international passengers arriving in India need to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine for 14 days, according to a guideline issued by the ministry of health and family welfare.The international passengers can stay in a paid quarantine facility for seven days at their cost and the next seven days in home quarantine.“However, there could be people like workers coming from other countries who might not be able to afford paid quarantine. So, we are setting up this facility where those who don’t want to pay can stay,” said a state health department official.The airport’s domestic flight services will resume on Thursday with 10 flights arriving and a similar number departing.But those arriving on domestic flights need not be quarantined.The state health department’s guidelines say those with mild symptoms can either go to a medical centre or stay in home quarantine under medical supervision. They have to undergo swab tests for Covid-19. Those with moderate and severe symptoms will be taken to a designated Covid hospital.The old terminal building will demolished as part of an expansion plan of the airport.In the first phase of the expansion, a building with 7,000sq m space will come up on the plot where the old domestic terminal stands.The hand-over of the quarantine facility to the state government was delayed because of Cyclone Amphan, an airport official said.The heavy rain and storm led to water leakage from the roof. The water had to be drained out and the floor cleaned before the beds could be set up.",2020-05-26 21:40:00

676,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus prejudice outlasts cyclone Amphan in West Bengal - Telegraph India,"A doctor, who had quarantined herself at home after testing positive for Covid-19, has alleged that some residents had prevented her family from hiring generators and buying drinking water in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan.The doctor, attached with Peerless Hospital, had tested positive earlier this month. She said her home in the Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality area was without power for three days after the cyclone struck on May 20.“There was no power supply in our area from Wednesday afternoon, just as the cyclone struck. Power was restored on Sunday afternoon. The inverter’s battery went off on Thursday evening and things were bad after that,” she said.In her neighbourhood, people had been roaming the streets with generator sets on rickshaw vans for hire, she said. “My husband called a few of them, but they pointed out a residential complex in our area and said that people there had asked them not to give generator sets on hire to our building.”Her father-in-law lives in the same building. He suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and needs oxygen support, she said. The oxygen concentrator, a machine that concentrates oxygen by drawing it from the air, needs power backup to function.She said the concentrator had stopped functioning from Thursday night and the oxygen cylinder kept as a backup had been exhausted by Saturday evening. “He had to survive on an inhaler in the absence of electricity.”Some residents told the person supplying water to households in the area not to serve her house, she alleged. “The man, though, said he would provide us with water early in the morning.”The Telegraph had earlier written about her allegation against civic officials calling her up on the first two days of her isolation and insisting that she get admitted to hospital. When some people of the area had barricaded her building, cops had to intervene.“This time we tried to call the police and the local councillor but we could not connect with them because of poor network,” she said.A resident of the area said people had tried to send her to hospital fearing the virus would spread in the area but were unable to do so because of her and her husband’s “high connections”. Her husband, too, is a doctor.“She told me she knew when to get admitted to hospital because she was a medical professional. I told her that she could get away by staying in home quarantine because she knew people in high places,” the resident said.“I had seen from my window they were trying to get a generator set. This would have spread infection in the area. But I had not interfered,” the resident said. “Now, their problems are over.",2020-05-26 21:59:00
677,Pranesh Sarkar,Cyclone fallout and response - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday listed in detail the damage caused by Cyclone Amphan in Bengal, attributing the data to primary information sent by officials from the districts.During a videoconference from Nabanna with district magistrates and police superintendents, she described the devastation under several heads and recommended measures to provide relief to the nearly “60 per cent of the state’s population” that has been affected.Some of the damage assessment and the instructions given by the chief minister:People: Six crore affected; 87 dead; 8.13 lakh evacuated; 2 lakh still in relief camps.“Please ensure that nobody faces starvation (in the camps). You can borrow foodstuff and feed the affected people, if necessary,” Mamata said.Homes: 10 lakh dwellings damaged. The state will release Rs 20,000 for each damaged dwelling. “With this, many of them can be repaired. Later, we will build houses under the Bangla Awas Yojana,” Mamata said.She instructed government officials to ensure that the house owners receive the money without delay. Task forces will be formed, one at the state level and the others at the district level, to ensure there’s no anomaly in the list of beneficiaries, she said.Drinking water: Some 1,231 water supply projects, out of 1,746, are damaged. Saline water has submerged many villages.The state will release Rs 100 crore to install tube wells in the cyclone-hit areas. “I don’t want projects to get delayed in the name of ‘assessments’. The installation of tube wells and assessments can be done simultaneously,” Mamata said.She asked PHE secretary Manoj Pant to urgently take up repairs of water supply projects.Power: On Wednesday afternoon, power had yet to be restored to around 30,000 CESC consumers, the chief minister said quoting from a report by the utility.She asked officials to coordinate with CESC so that the remaining 30,000 consumers too get back electricity quickly.Mamata enquired whether CESC could bring in workers from Rajasthan to meet the shortage of manpower. The state-run WBSEDCL informed Mamata that connections had been restored in 101 civic body areas, barring the areas under the Pujali and Gobardanga municipalities.“A total of 4.5 lakh electricity poles were uprooted or damaged. Many rural areas are still under water. Until the water recedes, poles cannot be erected. It has to be ensured that stagnant water does not lead to electrocution,” Mamata said.Embankments: Some 160km of river embankments, mainly those along the Raimangal, Matla, Bidyadhari, Muriganga and Hatania-Doania, have been breached. Several embankments in Kultali, Hingalganj and Patharpratima have become weak and could be breached during high tide.Repairs have to start immediately, Mamata said. If the damaged and breached portions are not repaired, fresh areas could be inundated during high tide on full moon, a few days from now, she added.“The work has to be done on a war footing…. The home secretary will be camping for three days in South 24-Parganas, starting tomorrow (Thursday), and the irrigation secretary will be camping in North 24-Parganas to help the district authorities,” Mamata said.Agriculture: Some 10.5 lakh hectares of farmland and about 1 lakh betel leaf farms are affected.A sum of Rs 5,000 will be given to each of the damaged betel leaf farms. Mamata has instructed officials to calculate the damage to agriculture within three days.The chief minister said the state government would distribute paddy seeds that can be grown in saline water among farmers in the cyclone-hit areas so they can start sowing for the coming kharif season.Roads: 317km of PWD roads and 4,710km of rural roads, along with 300 small bridges or culverts, are damaged.The PWD will repair its 317km of damaged bituminous roads as early as possible while the Sunderbans development affairs department will start repairing 700km of village roads. The rest of the damaged rural roads will be repaired by the panchayat department once the water recedes.Buildings: About 1.1 lakh school buildings are damaged; so are 2,000 health centres and 4,200 ICDS centres.The respective departments have been asked to undertake repairs immediately. Mamata said the toilets at the school buildings must be repaired first. Some schools will be turned into institutional quarantine centres for migrant workers returning from five states.Other damage: Saline water has entered about 58,000 hectares of water bodies; 8,000 fishing boats are damaged; 9 lakh heads of cattle are dead.The chief minister asked the respective departments to make use of the available funds to help those affected.“For a year, saline water fish can be cultivated in the ponds where saltwater rushed in,” she said.",2020-05-27 19:24:00
679,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in Bengal: Bent lamp posts pose commute risk in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Bent or half-broken electric poles are hanging over roads across Calcutta and Salt Lake a week after Cyclone Amphan had struck Bengal, posing a risk to commuters.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC), the owners of most of these poles in Calcutta and Salt Lake, have not shown any urgency to remove the ones that have been bent or broken.Firhad Hakim, the chairperson of the board of administrators of the CMC, said on Wednesday evening: “We have started removing the damaged poles. It will take about a week.”Krishna Chakraborty, the mayor of the BMC, said she would look into the issue.“As it is, we are facing an uphill task removing trees. Nobody has complained about the poles yet but we will send assessment teams,” she said.With lockdown restrictions being eased, more and more people are stepping out for work. “Many people could get injured if a bent lamp post triggers an accident. Some might even lose their lives,” said a resident of Ballygunge, where a few lamp posts were found broken on Wednesday.A police officer said about 30 electric poles had slanted dangerously in the Gariahat-Dhakuria-Southern Avenue-Ballygunge belt. Only five or six were removed till Wednesday.Broken and slanted poles were spotted in all three sectors of Salt Lake.A street light hangs precariously over the main road that connects EE block to GD block and broken signal poles lie strewn near the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre on Broadway.On VIP Road, too, several broken poles were spotted jutting out of the main carriageway at multiple points such as Lake Town, Kaikhali and Dakshindari.“Over 4,000 poles have been uprooted across Calcutta. We are working on removing them fast. We have also floated tenders for new poles so that no stretch of road remains dark for long,” said a CMC official.Amphan had uprooted a large number of tress across Calcutta. The CMC took days to remove the trees. The delay led to protests, following which the state government sought the army’s help to cut and remove uprooted trees.Among the other pockets where such poles have been spotted are Rashbehari Avenue, Lansdowne, Esplanade, Chowringhee, Ballygunge, Sovabazar, Shyambazar and Kasba.“I was crossing Shakespeare Sarani on Tuesday. An electric pole was standing inclined over the road near its crossing with Camac Street. The metal has cracked near the base,” said a banker.“The pole was inclined and there was every possibility that the rest of the metal could crack, too. In which case, the pole could come crashing down on the road. If it falls on someone, there could be a serious accident.”On New Alipore’s NR Avenue, at least one lamp post was hanging close to the road. The metal had broken near the middle of the pole. A mesh of wires was hanging from the pole and a part of it was lying on the road.“We are not going anywhere near the pole and the wires. It is difficult for us to distinguish between an electric wire and a cable TV wire,” said a resident of the area.In front of the Tipu Sultan mosque in Esplanade, a pole with multiple wires hanging from it stood slanted towards the main road. Motorists and pedestrians were crossing the stretch keeping a safe distance from the pole.",2020-05-27 21:45:00
680,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus lockdown: Stalls, not all with numbers, reopen in Kolkata - Telegraph India","Pavement stalls in Gariahat reopened on Wednesday morning but only a few had numbers written on the pavement in front of them.The owners of stalls that are yet to be numbered said the lockdown had pushed them to the wall and they could not afford to wait any longer.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on May 19 said hawkers could reopen their stalls from May 27 but suggested that they adopt an odd-even formula to ensure shoppers maintain social distancing.Under the formula, the stalls with odd numbers and those with even numbers will open on alternate days.There are about 5,000 hawkers in and around Gariahat and close to 2,500 in the Hatibagan area. Sources said only 45 stalls in Gariahat — the ones around the municipal corporation market — have been numbered.Hawkers who opened their shops did not have ropes in front to ensure social distancing. None wore gloves but all were wearing masks. Some kept sanitisers in small bottles. “We have drawn up a list of odd-even stalls and all the owners have been given a set of advisories on maintaining social distancing,” said Debraj Ghosh, a hawker union leader of Gariahat.“We had held a meeting on May 19 with two other union leaders on how to go about it. There is no problem now.”Officers of Gariahat police station said a list of stalls has been drawn up but the unions were still to complete writing the numbers on the footpath, in front of the respective stalls. “We are continuously nudging them. They have assured us that it would be completed in two days,” an officer said.Several Calcuttans have expressed the fear that it would be impossible to follow physical distancing norms on pavements once hawkers’ stalls were reopened. Officers at Lalbazar said all police stations had been asked to ensure that the odd-even policy was strictly enforced.“Officers doing the rounds in their respective areas will have to ensure that all hawkers keep sanitisers and wear masks,” an officer said. “We will complete the numbering process once the trees and branches that fell during last week’s storm are removed,” said a member of the Hawker Sangram Committee.",2020-05-27 21:47:00
681,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in Bengal: Vacant stare at static fan - Telegraph India,"Power supply has been temporarily restored to many places of the city since Amphan struck a week ago but thousands of people are still in the dark. The Telegraph went to two such pockets of Behala on Wednesday afternoon, a week after Amphan battered the city.Staring at the ceiling fanA three-storey apartment block on Biren Roy Road (West) is like a dark island with power back in most adjacent houses. A septuagenarian couple live in a first-floor flat of the building.Tarun Kumar Ghosh, 78, was sitting at the feet of his bedridden wife, Juthika, when this newspaper visited the apartment on Wednesday around 3pm. “My wife was diagnosed with a brain tumour a year and a half ago. She cannot speak much but keeps looking at the ceiling fan. Life has been a misery for her. For the past few days, it has become unbearable,” said Ghosh, a former employee of Coal India Limited.A pair of windows in the east is the only respite for the couple, who live with their son, daughter-in-law and two-year-old granddaughter. A series of empty bottles of mosquito spray were lined under the bed. “Swarms of mosquitoes make things worse after sundown. But we cannot shut the windows to prevent feeling suffocated,” said Ghosh.Post-sundown, he always stays by his wife’s side because she “panics when she is alone in the dark”.The building has 12 flats, with people living in seven of them. The residents together have been spending Rs 3,500 a day to use a generator for an hour to pump water to the rooftop reservoir.A van ferrying CESC workers had arrived on Wednesday afternoon, trying to organise a temporary supply from an adjacent feeder box. A man accompanying the van said he was sent by Partha Chatterjee, the Trinamul MLA from Behala West and state education minister, to “address the problems of power outage”.Grounded: pole and hopeLess than a kilometre away, around 100 people had gathered outside Sarsuna police station. The gates were closed and the men and women, some with folded hands, were pleading with two cops inside. “We have been without power for eight days. At least arrange a makeshift connection,” a woman told a cop.The group had come from multiple pockets of Sarsuna. One of them was No. 2 Kartiknagar, in Ward 127 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.An uprooted electric pole with dangling wires lay at the entrance to a narrow lane that led to the neighbourhood. “Over 100 houses are without power. We are neglected because we don’t live in highrises. There are so many senior citizens and patients here,” said Dipak Das, a resident.In a single-storey house, a stone’s throw from the fallen pole, Sukla Ghosh was resting on a bed. The house stood in the middle of an alley and very little sunlight made it to the room.“She is a kidney patient and underwent dialysis on Monday,” said her daughter Shilpi,who is pursuing MCom from an open university. The insulin that Sukla needs has to be preserved in a refrigerator. Shilpi said she had to go to a friend’s home — where power has been restored — every day to keep the medicine in the fridge.",2020-05-27 21:48:00
683,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Autos resume with double fare in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Auto services resumed in Calcutta on Wednesday. Most auto drivers charged double the fare and many ferried three passengers in violation of the government rule of two.Auto operators justified charging double the fare, saying it was to compensate for the reduction in the number of passengers.The fare on the Ultadanga-Sovabazar route was Rs 30 for every passenger on Wednesday. It used to be Rs 16 before the lockdown.It was the same on many other routes. Autos on the Kasba-New Market-Dhakuria route charged Rs 25. Earlier, it was Rs 13. On the Behala Chowrasta-New Alipore route, auto drivers charged Rs 30. It was Rs 16 earlier.A few of the autos that ferried passengers between Ruby and Gariahat charged Rs 20. The fare before the lockdown was Rs 12.Tapan Bandopadhayay, of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, said the government had rejected the fare structure proposed by bus operators. “But does it mean there will be no more discussions on fare revision at all?” he asked. “When has the government agreed to implement any of our proposals for a fare hike without making changes?”Unlike bus and taxi fares, the government doesn’t regulate auto fares, a transport department official said. Auto unions fix fares on a particular route, depending on the number of autos and the length of the route, the official said.People across parts of south and north Calcutta did not get into argument with auto drivers over the fare hike.“We alerted passengers about the new fare before starting a trip (Rs 15 against Rs 9),” Purna Chandra Pradhan, 52, an auto driver on the Gariahat-Rashbehari Avenue crossing route, said. “No one complained. Some even said they were aware of the realities of the lockdown and paid the new fare with a smile.”At several parts of Calcutta, a few autos carried more than two passengers. At Gariahat, traffic constables stopped some auto drivers and asked them to keep sanitisers ready for passengers.Most auto drivers had masks but hardly anyone wore gloves. Some auto drivers had sanitisers for passengers. A few said they had washed and cleaned their vehicles before setting out.“We have told every auto driver to carry hand sanitisers for passengers. A few may have missed out,” an auto union leader on the Sovabazar-Ultadanga route said on Wednesday.Close to 800 autos ply on the route. “Everything will be in place from tomorrow,” the union leader said.",2020-05-27 21:49:00
685,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus outbreak: Brands unveil thrust on masks in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The malls are shut but a handful of standalone apparel stores that have opened in the city are seeing only a few customers throughout the day.Most of the people walking in have one requirement — a mask.One such store on Camac Street has stocked up masks. Others are telling walk-in customers that masks should reach them within a few days.Online order of masks on e-commerce platforms is on the rise, thanks to promotional messages and videos from popular brands to customers. Advertisers and marketers said the thrust shows leading brands are gearing up for life with the novel coronavirus and finding ways to leverage the crisis.The Camac Street store of a popular brand of clothes, backpacks, shoes and other outdoor accessories had a large promotional sticker about newly arrived masks pasted on the glass door at the entrance.Their USP: “Anti-pollution, anti-trust and anti-bacterial”, the poster said. Each mask could be used till “30 gentle washes”, said Manav Ravi, a sales associate at the store, that had reopened in the first week of May.The masks, that came in small, medium and large sizes, cost Rs 200 apiece.The first lot of masks, from the production unit in Bangalore, arrived within a couple of days of the reopening. On Monday, The Telegraph saw a series of cartons stacked up at two corners of the store, all fresh arrivals. Each carton had 100 masks. There were 70 cartons, said Ravi. “We have been selling around 10 masks every day,” he said. Awinash Kumar, who handles the backend operations of a retail store in the vicinity, was one of the buyers on Monday. “There is a trust associated with branded products. Branded masks are no different. I am ready to pay more if I know my mask is better than local stuff,” said Kumar.A few metres away, a men’s apparel store on Shakespeare Sarani was waiting  for the arrival of masks from Bangalore.Two hundred packs, each with five masks, left Bangalore by road on May 20 and is supposed to reach here before this weekend, said Kunal Kapasi, the store manager.The masks should be on the shelves from next week, he said. The brand is focussing on the mask as an “essential commodity” and had kept a “very competitive price”, added Kapasi.A pack of reusable five masks of different colours will cost Rs 599.Most stores are yet to get stocks but e-commerce platforms are selling masks. Arunava Majumder, who works in the marketing division of an online budget hotel aggregator, has just ordered a pack of five masks of the same brand whose store this newspaper visited on Shakespeare Sarani. “I will have to start meeting prospective clients very soon (post-lockdown) and make pitches. I think a branded mask will make the same impression that a branded shirt does,” he said.Sayantan Guha, who works in the retail assets division of a private bank, ordered a pack of five masks from another apparel brand, known for its signature “Friday dressing”. Guha said he was very impressed by a short promotional video that he got from a friend who works with the brand.“The lockdown has crippled many apparel brands. They are now trying to leverage the Covid-19 crisis to advantage. They are trying to find ways to monetise it,” said Arunabho Sen, an advertising professional based in Bangalore, who has worked with JWT India and MullenLowe Lintas Group.“Big players have already invested a lot in research to find ways of marketing masks. Breathing comfort, highlighting pores in the mask, is one outcome of it,” said Sen, who now looks after the marketing and promotionals of an online gaming start-up.",2020-05-27 21:53:00

Our first priority was to clear the main roads for essential services like ambulances. For that we had to cut some trees. But for the rest, the instruction was to save as many as possible. It takes considerable manpower and effort to prop up a full-grown tree but still we are doing it. We have already been able to save 100 trees,” said NKDA chairman cum managing director Debashis Sen.The species that have got most impacted by the cyclone Amphan are babla, krishnachura, radhachura and a few coconut trees. “New Town used to be barren. We have planted these trees ourselves. They are like our children,” he added.Private initiatives are also being reported from across the township. At least five housing societies have taken an initiative to save the trees that had fallen on their premises.The first complex to act was Rosedale Garden. “We have one of the finest central lawns among the housing complexes in New Town with close to 100 varieties of trees. We have nurtured these trees with a lot of care over 10 to 12 years. We will try to save each and every tree that has fallen,” Ranjan Basu of Rosedale Garden told The Telegraph Salt Lake on Friday, two days after the cyclone struck Bengal. As he spoke, people tied a nylon rope around the trunk of a prostrate ficus benjamina and hauled it up. “Chopping a fallen tree is easy. We are taking the bigger challenge,” he added. Close to 40 trees had got flattened by the cyclone in the complex.As word spread about their attempt, other housing complexes also came forward. “We are really attached to our trees as we have seen them grow ever since we settled in the complex. Residents used to feed the birds nesting here. When the storm uprooted so many of them, children in many apartments were crying. We had no idea that the trees could be replanted. Once we heard about Rosedale’s initiative, we got in touch with the nursery that takes care of their greenery,” said Biplab Basu, secretary of Greenwood Park in Action Area 1. The three biggest trees could not be saved. But the other 20-odd could be. “The people from the nursery along with our men worked for six hours. We will keep the trees tied to a support for the next six-seven months till they firmly take root again.”Next door to Greenwood Park, Utsa Luxury was also looking up ways to save about 20 trees that had suffered in the cyclone. “Where would we get manpower amid the lockdown? So over 15 residents joined hands with four security guards under the guidance of our gardener. Four trees which had got completely uprooted were beyond help. We used the Y-shaped branches of those trees to provide support to the ones that we could revive. The whole process took us three days,” said Kanu Bhowmick, secretary of Utsa Luxury Complex Apartment Owners’ Association. “The Krishnachura-Radhachura trees were about 15 years old. If we tried planting saplings in their place, it would take another 15 years to grow back to that height.”Pallab Roy of Sunrise Symphony has been checking on the trees they tried to save every day. “We are taking turns to look up how the replanted trees are faring. Today the rope we had tied them with to the boundary wall seemed less taut, which would mean the tree is taking root. Twelve trees fell in our campus. Eight could be saved. On our gardener’s advice, a hole deeper by another foot was dug for the trunk to be fitted in,” said the treasurer of Sunrise Symphony Apartment Owners’ Association.If these trees were all within the campus of the complexes, Akankha tried saving even trees on the divider outside. “About eight trees were standing but leaning at a steep incline. Though it was on the road divider, we, the three adjacent housing societies, had planted them at our own expense. Our gardeners tried to make them stand. When they failed on their own, the housekeeping boys joined them. They trimmed the branches and created a bamboo scaffold all around to provide them support,” said Dibyendu Roy, Akankha Krishnachura Apartment Owners Association. Half a dozen trees inside the campus were similarly restituted.The knowhow for the resurrection of the trees at Greenwood Park and Rosedale was provided by Arjun Sarkar, the owner of Sarkar Nursery near Vedic Village. “Cyclone Aila did not create as much havoc 11 years ago as Amphan has simply because New Town did not have so many trees then,” he said. The first step to make a tree stand up again is to trim the extra branches and reduce the load on the main stem. The next step is to free the roots of clay. Some twisted roots might need to be chopped, ensuring least damage to the tree. Then once the tree is up, it would need support, be it on bamboo poles or simply of rope tied to something stable. Then fresh soil needs to be inserted in the hole. “Since this is high summer, I expect the roots to clutch the soil soon. The arrival of monsoon would be an added advantage. The process takes much longer in winter,” he explained.At Rosedale, Sarkar says, his men managed to save about 60 trees. “There are several varieties of Ficus at Rosedale. Only 7-8 kadam trees could not be saved. We could save the remaining 70 or so trees. We added some rooting hormone to the soil. At Greenwood Park, it was mix of species - ficus, palash, kanchan, jarul…,” he added.In New Town’s CE Block, a tree escaped the hatchet almost miraculously. “The NKDA men chopped the branches and had landed the first blow on the trunk when the tree that was bent double suddenly sprang to an erect position!” exclaimed Alok Das, secretary of CE Block Cultural Association. About 10 trees had been damaged in the cyclone. The rest were chopped. “We will plant saplings in their place if NKDA doesn’t. In any case, we plant 100 saplings every year,” he said.",2020-05-28 11:04:00
690,Brinda Sarkar,Lockdown: GC Block deploys cook to run community kitchen in salt lake - Telegraph India,"GC Block Welfare Association has started a community kitchen to help out residents during the lockdown. And it’s killing two birds with one stone, as they have given charge of the kitchen to a cook who lives in a garage in the block. Her family too is making a living now from selling the food.The facility started in the first week of May. “Our domestic helps come from Duttabad which is a containment zone so we were not allowing any of them in. But the senior citizens were facing a lot of problems,” says the block’s executive committee member Jhumpa Ghosh. “They somehow managed to pull through March and April but when the lockdown got stretched into May they couldn’t take it anymore.”So as a brainchild of secretary Santanu Das, vice-president Sujoy Saha and others, the kitchen emerged. The committee decided to let out the community hall free of charge to Rabi Mondal’s family. Rabi, who has been living in the garage of GC 38 for more than a decade, paints houses but is also a man Friday of sorts for neighbours, running errands, helping with heavy lifting and assisting the community hall’s security guard.His wife Malina is a cook at two GD Block homes. Son Deep is a driver and daughter-in-law Rumpa, a homemaker. Rumpa is also six months pregnant. “But we have all been unemployed since the lockdown and were living on charity from block residents,” says Rabi.But since early this month, Malina and Rumpa are cooking, Rabi packing the food up in tiffin carriers and Deep delivering them to residents on his cycle. A WhatsApp group has been created by the block committee where residents place orders twice a day for lunch and dinner.“We discuss the menu with family beforehand, depending on availability of vegetables. We ensure one particular dish isn’t repeated before three days,” says Jhumpa. “We fix prices judiciously too. We want Rabi’s family to take home something for their labour but also do not want residents to get fleeced.” So their vegetarian thali comprises rice, dal, bhaja, tarkari, chutney and costs Rs 65. Rohu curry can be bought separately for Rs 50. For dinner, they are offering options like chicken, tadka dal, ghughni and egg curry.“Most days we are getting orders for 20 to 25 families but then on the day of Amphan this number doubled. We had khichuri, beguni and chutney that day and the ladies had to cook twice over,” says Rabi, who himself cooks at the block’s events once in a while. “In fact that’s how I have some large utensils ready for this home delivery system now.”Playing a huge supporting role in this initiative is Sumbul Yazdani, the landlady of GC 38. Sumbul, who has moved to Delhi, has allowed Rabi to use her utensils and even refrigerator, which he has ferried to the community hall to store ingredients.  “Malina is a great cook, having been trained by my mother,” says Sumbul. “My mother Shahnaaz Rafique (better known as Naaz in the block) would frequently host gatherings of 50 to 100 people so we have huge utensils. My mother passed away in January but would have been very happy to know her protegee is helping her neighbours in this hour of need.”While Malina’s sukto, posto, rajma and chicken champ have garnered many fans, Sumbul recommends her biriyani and kebabs on the menu sometime.The service has been god-sent for residents, especially elderly ones like Prasanta Narayan Dutta. His wife is unwell after suffering a stroke and the math professor himself is occupied all day with online classes and administrative work. “I would have to sit to chop vegetables at 11pm,” he says, recalling the days of exhaustion. “I’m grateful for this food delivery service. The fare is light, tasty and hygienic. It’s saving me time and energy. All I have to do is hand them tiffin boxes and the food comes.”While the entire township is starved of such a service, Ghosh says they cannot expand under the given situation. “It’s not safe now as there are containment zones all over,” she says.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-05-28 12:40:00

693,The Telegraph,Lockdown diaries: How Salt Lake residents are spending time indoors - Telegraph India,"Debangi ChakrabortyResident of: Millennium Tower, New Town“Locked up” would be a more suitable phrase to describe our situation and it has started taking a toll on us. I’m feeling like a princess locked in a tower waiting for the prince to arrive and rescue her.While the lockdown is dragging all my joys away from us, we can be productive and creative now. Experts are advising us to stay active but this does not mean running around or exercising like a health nut. It means not lazing in bed eating popcorn and watching Netflix. Although it’s a great time to do so. We can do yoga or light exercises to keep fit. It is also a good time to have a reunion with friends on video chat and Google Duo.I do calligraphy, read and sometimes watch movies. Though my best friend and I are 30km apart, we are connected through email. It’s like just writing letters, only that it reaches in a fraction of seconds.Reading is something which makes my mind break all doors and reach the corners of the world even though physically we are locked between four concrete walls. Music makes me rewind. Currently I am listening to The heart wants what it wants by Selena Gomez.The lockdown is a perfect time to exhibit our artistic creations so I’m also creating animations on Adobe Photoshop. It is pretty fun. We also have ample time to sleep. Lockdown does not mean sulking inside four dark walls. It means breaking these walls and finding your way out.Dilip SyamResident of: Sanjeeva Town Bunglow Estate, New TownMy greatest accomplishment during the lockdown has been to realise my dream and complete two jobs that had been pending for 15 years, ever since my retirement from the tea industry.My wife’s biggest complaint about me has been the number of photo albums I have collected over the years (more than 50). Now how does one collate and choose memories of 80 years of one’s life? How do I choose what memories to save and and what to throw away in the trash? Can I actually discard any memories? My memories are my essence but for my wife they are mostly random events occupying space and limiting her ever-growing collection of silver and crystals.Well, I have now digitised my photos and saved the memories. I am happy that I didn’t have to compromise and my wife is happier as she can now display her treasures. Phew.... relationship saved?My son loves my stories of the tea gardens capturing my experience of over 40 years there. It includes his growing-up years in the wilderness of nature hearing funny, scary, enchanting tales which beats any Famous Five stories or Laurel & Hardy movies or even The Adventures of Tintin.He has always wanted me to pen down these stories to share with others. I also had a huge collection of photographs of my international travels and experience of working across the entire Northeast.I listened to my son and put all of this in an edition of short stories called Lockdown Diaries — Chai Bagaan Adventures from the Bygone eras of 1960s to 2000s. I hope these stories can be passed on to the next generation.Debanjana GhatakResident of: Labony EstateI am really happy as after years I am once again enjoying the life of an owl. I am going to sleep at 4am and getting up by nine. At night when my parents are asleep I switch off all the lights and listen to music on my headphone and feel ecstatic.The institution I’m attached with hasn’t asked me to work from home so besides helping my mom, I am free. I have been writing poems for years but have now taken it up seriously. I have already written 120 poems. I am also honing my reading, listening, photography and watching skills. There are plenty of storybooks on my bookshelf and most on them are unread. I always wanted to read them but made the excuse of not having time. Now I’ve completed The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski and will take up The Case of the Missing Marquess by Nancy Springer next.Every morning, I carry my camera to the terrace and click birds, trees, flowers, squirrels and more. Thanks to Netflix and Disney Plus, I am watching new series and movies. Yes, sometimes I have to go to the market for essentials and this is a big challenge for me.Every morning, I pray to God to keep us safe and give us patience and hope to survive the crisis.Rangan DattaResident of: AA BlockI am spending my lockdown days making Wikipedia entries.I have been attached with Wikipedia since 2011 doing online and offline work. Two weeks before the lockdown, I was in Mumbai attending a workshop of Wikipedia trainers. I returned on March 4 and before I could digest the huge amount of knowledge gathered, the lockdown began.So now I’m spending time uploading photos in Wikimedia Commons — www.commons.wikimedia.org. These are photos used in different articles of Wikipedia. I am also categorising them, making it easier for other editors to spot.As I am a travel writer and blogger, Wikivoyage has always been my favourite and I am editing pages and uploading pictures there extensively.Tiyasha BiswasResident of: Dum Dum ParkBeing a 17-year-old who has just finished her Class XII Board exams, I am trying to be productive.

I am also attending online classes to help me secure admission to good colleges.I also have more time to spend with my family and I am amazed how good it feels. I tried cooking — something new for me — and made the internet-viral Dalgona Coffee. It’s my favourite now.I’ve started a YouTube channel to post my painting videos and since I’m into spirituality, I often lie under the sky and watch the stars. They give me hope.

694,Jayanta Basu,Cyclone Amphan in Bengal: AJ Block man does fallen tree survey - Telegraph India,"What the administration or urban planners should have done but did not, a nature guide cum nature tour organiser has done all by himself in Salt Lake after the cyclone — assessing the dynamics and pattern of tree felling during an extremely high wind speed cyclone like Amphan.“It is useless if we only lament and not take a lesson from the disasters” said Soumya Kundu of AJ Block who undertook the detailed exercise the day after the cyclone, covering at least 15 blocks in the city, before the municipal corporation started clearing the uprooted trees.“This is not a scientific analysis but not a random observation either. Over the years, I have observed the trees after the storm. There is a clear pattern which shows that some trees remain unaffected and some get easily damaged,” said Kundu, who also highlighted the finding on his Facebook wall.Mayor Krishna Chakraborty admitted the unplanned planting coupled with sandy soil did the damage. “Salt Lake almost looked like a warzone after the cyclone. It’s really shocking to see so many trees being uprooted, many of which we used to see regularly,” said Chakraborty. She promised to consult experts to facilitate scientific planting in future. The mayor hailed Kundu’s survey on tree toppling and promised to take input from the findings.The findings are truly revealing. “Radhachura, Eucalyptus and Krishnchura are the most toppled types, while Mango trees have also been damaged in slightly lesser number, so did Mahogonies,” said Kundu, pointing out that apart from species types, also the pruning pattern and concretisation around the base seemed to have contributed to compromised stability of trees in Salt Lake.According to the assessment, Aswattha is the least uprooted tree while only handful of Banyan trees has been uprooted. “I can hardly remember seeing an Aswattha tree completely flattened while Banyan trees seemed to have only damaged in the roadside where it did not get enough space to spread its root system,” explained Kundu.Few coconut trees were damaged while Kadam trees were damaged but minimally uprooted, according to the assessment. Interestingly Chhatim trees, though seemed to be battered by the highest ever wind speed in decades, have rarely been toppled.Overall the nature guide, who often goes to the Sunderbans from where the cyclone came, listed his findings of about 46 species of trees. “Given the present scenario of global warming, we can only expect the storms to get worse and hence we need to plan properly for planting trees,” observed Kundu.",2020-05-28 13:49:00
696,The Telegraph,Lockdown: Rabindranath Tagore tributes online on Rabindra Jayanti - Telegraph India,"New Town Residents’ Welfare ForumThe pain of having to perform in isolation was apparent in the voices of guest artistes Debashish and Rohini Raychaudhuri, who are regulars on the township’s Rabindra Jayanti stages. “We cannot see you. Like you, we are not venturing outdoors,” they said, before singing Anandadhara bohichhe bhubone and Bipul torongo re.The video conference was a novel experience for many of the participants. Anchor Gopa Basu kept her cool as she shepherded her list of artistes, who were visible only on her computer screen. “Taraknath Giri achhen? Nei? Tahole Kanta Dutta Roy prostut thakun er por,” she said, trying to spot the desired faces from the gallery on screen.She even had to keep artiste requests in mind. “Milu Mitra has to take some medicines at a fixed time. So we need to let her off early,” she announced, introducing the elderly lady who could not be spotted. “We can see only your ceiling,” Basu told her as the lady kept asking if she was visible, and even offered to start without proper video feed in desperation at one point. Finally when the matter was sorted and she started to sing, she faced interruptions twice, in the form of voices in the online audience. “Please mute them,” she pleaded. Her third attempt “to give a message of peace in a turbulent time” was fruitful, resulting in a fine rendition of Santi koro borishon.Amrita Dutta was singing Oje mane na mana when the link snapped. “Amrita ke dekhao jachchhe na, sonao jachchhe na.” Debajyoti Dey, who was providing technical back-up, faced a tough time. “So many participants have already joined the programme. I cannot get them out of the meeting and start afresh,” he conceded.Madhurima Pal, however, was adept. Setting the camera up at a favourable angle, she danced with abandon to Mon mor megher sangi in her drawing room.In some houses, there was excitement in the whole family about the programme. Jayashree Pramanik came on view with her mother Nilima Sen and together sang Jodi prem dile na prane. She even requested that her daughter be given a chance. The little one, in her mother’s lap, could not be made to face the camera but was persuaded to sing a stanza of Hey sokha momo hridoye roho.The programme lasted for over three hours. “Under normal circumstances, many blocks would have performed separately. Since they could not, we decided to take this online. It caused great excitement. Though a few of the performers failed to log in and we could not go live on Facebook as planned, it was a success,” said Dipak Biswas, the forum’s cultural committee convenor.DrammarThe video conference was hosted by Sukumar Chakraborty, co-founder of the six-year-old theatre group, and members logged in excitedly. “Being an IT person, I’m on Zoom (the app that was used) all the time these days,” he said.Sujata Majumdar sang Hey nuton, Avijit Chakraborty recited Proshno but at the very moment that Soumik De prepared to sing, his screen blacked out.“Load shedding!” said a confused Soumik. Luckily the lights returned fast and he turned on the karaoke music from his computer and sang Amar poran jaha chay mellifluously. While he took a break, Biswajit Chakraborty recited but was shocked to learn that his video had been off all the while!Another hiccup was when EC Block couple Ananya Ghosh and Jaideep Gupta’s reading of an excerpt of Shesher Kabita could not be heard. “We anticipated network problems so had recorded the piece the night before. We mailed it to Sukumarda but it wasn’t playing on his computer either,” said Ananya.Upamanyu Das, another member, then volunteered to help. “Mail it to me, let me try to play it,” said the member who is pursuing a wildlife photography course in New Zealand. The mail was sent while still on air and played loud and clear for the others. Upamanyu has a studio set up at home and sang there, even if it meant staying up till 4am local time.Mother-daughter duo Srabani and Srija Chakraborty sang Ei lobhino sango tobo while father Sukumar played harmonium. One of the youngest performers was Moinak Pal Chowdhury, a student of Bidhannagar College, who sang Ekla cholo re.The lone dance performance was by Sonali Basak, who partnered Aruni Majumdar in reciting an excerpt of Rakta Karabi. The group is planning an online show of their next audio play. “I’ve just completed the script,” says Sukumar, “It’s on the lockdown.”CD Block, New TownThe script wasn’t original but everyone enjoyed it all the same. “The organisers of the show were insisting that I take part but I wasn’t prepared. Then I received a WhatsApp forward this morning that linked Rabindrajayanti with the lockdown. I decided to recite it,” said the resident of New Town’s CD Block.The show saw a host of other performances too. Sudipto Mojumder sang Jhoro jhoro borishe bari, Sonchaita Shnatra sang Phule phule as well as Ye Banks and Braes, the Scottish original that inspired it while Mrinalini Chatterjee sang Jodi tor dak shune while strumming her guitar.Shruti Chinya danced to Madhuro madhuro dhwani but was upstaged by slow internet connection. “I had started dancing but had to stop midway as the net connection got disrupted. I decided not to start over as there was a long queue after me,” said the lady.The event was hosted by Dipika Ghatak, whose mother Sithi Kana Ghatak is the block’s cultural convenor. Both mother and daughter recited while Sithi also sang Mone robe kina robe. “It’s been weeks since we met. Even if not physically, at least we got to see and hear one another through this event,” said Sithi.The show concluded with an open-to-all chorus of Akash bhora, led by Patralekha Mukherjee.Ta thoi“Imagine what pauses would do to fast tracks like Pran chay chokkhu na chay,” he said. Nonetheless his students carried on. Faizan Ahmed of Class V played Purano sei diner katha while K. Sradha played Anandoloke mangalaloke, both on the guitar.The school, that teaches several disciplines, was hosting each department’s celebration on different days. The dancers were not without their share of technical glitches. Saheli Chowdhuri had to stop dancing to Phagun haway haway as no one could see her. The schedule was rejigged and she was given a later slot when she could finally perform. “Most of us are using this online platform for the first time so there were bound to be glitches. Still it was quite a feat pulling it off without any rehearsals with our teachers,” said Saheli, a businesswoman. “I was most excited at being able to apply lipstick after almost two months!”Piyali Sur sang to Hey nutan, Aarohi Sengupta to Pran bhoriye trisha horiye (on her second try thanks to slow internet speed) and Debanjana Dutta, a special child with Sturge-Weber syndrome, sang as her grandmother played the harmonium.Dalina Sarkar enjoyed dancing to Janani tomar so much that she equated it with a trip to Digha! “That’s what dancing felt like after a month’s lockdown,” she laughed.“I asked students to pray that next time we can perform on stage,” said Manimala Upadhyay, a kathak teacher and host of the session. “We are holding Zoom classes since April so we decided to hold Rabindrajayanti here too.” Principal Sagarika Mitra said response had been excellent despite the challenges.Bharati KanjilalGulabi Gang, DB BlockThe show saw participation from their family members too. Audio drama Petey o Pithey was presented by Sonali Basak, Chandrani Mukherjee, Mou Dubey, Anjana Banerjee and Mahua De Sarkar. It was directed — over phone — by Mahua’s husband Soumya.Again, when Jhupan Das sang Hriday amar nachilo, sister Ishani Das danced along. Ishani’s husband Prabhudan Biswas narrated a script before the show. Earlier Jhupan’s son Samvit Ukil, 7, sang Pagla hawa while Ishani’s daughter Sampurna Biswas, 4, danced along. “This show came at the right time. The kids were getting bored and restless at not being able to go out to play,” said Ishani.Priyanka Niyogi’s father Dhurjati Sarkar recited Krishnakali ami tarei bole too. “My father, 70, loves poetry and has been penning poems on the lockdown. He was so happy to have found a platform to recite,” said Niyogi, who presented the inaugural dance Mor beena uthe. “Even though we are physically constrained, activities like poetry and dance can keep us fresh,” said the lady who is also imparting dance lessons online.Taking part were also members like Lakshmimani Sen who is stuck in Bangalore with her son due to the lockdown and Indrani Basak, who is in Gurgaon with her daughter. Both read out passages from and on Tagore.Finally Sonali Basak conveyed the vote of thanks in an innovative way, weaving in Rabindrasangeet like Amra chanchal, Amar bela je jaye and Sajani sajani. “We Gulabi Gang members are a fun-loving lot,” said Basak.",2020-05-28 14:07:00
698,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Generator suppliers around Calcutta make hay - Telegraph India,"The cyclone, it appears, has been a blessing in disguise for generator suppliers who have done brisk business in Calcutta and neighbouring areas, which were without power till Tuesday night.Tapas Halder and Gopal Mandal — electricians by profession — who have been without any business during the lockdown now have money. They charged a premium as they rented out their generator sets, enabling houses to use pumps to draw water from reservoirs to overhead tanks.The rates ranged from Rs 15,00 to Rs 2,000 an hour as desperate residents took such sets to survive the prolonged power cut.Generator suppliers had been roaming the streets in the Regent Estate area, one of the worst-hit residential complexes in Jadavpur, with generator sets on rickshaws, searching for potential customers, since the cyclone raged across the city on May 20.There was no dearth of customers, be it in Regent Estate or Netaji Nagar near Ranikuthi, as residents relied on generator sets in the absence of quick response from CESC, the power utility company.Tapas Hader, 28, who stays in Vidya Sagar colony in Jadavpur, visited Regent Estate on May 21, the day after the cyclone had struck, on his first assignment to provide a set to a building. As news spread in the neighbourhood, soon others wanted to hire his set (12KV capacity).He said he had provided the set to at least 27 houses in the past six days. “In some households, I have charged Rs 2,000 an hour. In some, the rate was settled at Rs 1,500.... I have managed to overcome the slump because of the lockdown.”People like Halder and Mandal have lost electrical assignments at homes because people are wary of potential health hazard.Halder, who had switched to selling fish, landed with his 10-year-old generator set as residents needed a backup, mainly to run water pumps.Some households ran the generator for an hour.Shibaji Bhowmik, a resident of Regent Estate said, the duration depended on the size of the reservoir.

699,Debraj Mitra, Coronavirus Lockdown: Day 1: Smooth Kolkata Metro trial run - Telegraph India,"Two pairs of Metro trains ran the full stretch between Dum Dum and Kavi Subhash on Thursday, the first time in 64 days.Both pairs ran without any trouble, a Metro official said.Metro started trial runs from Thursday to check the preparedness of its rolling stock and electrical assets. The services were stopped on March 25 as part of the nationwide lockdown.“All the trains will be tested in the coming days. The functioning of the doors, cooling, jerks during journey, brakes and all other components will be monitored. The electrical assets will be checked,” The Telegraph spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said.The first pair of trains left Noapara and Kavi Subhash stations around 10.15am, an official said. The occupants were members of the Metro maintenance staff and other employees posted at the headquarters in Park Street.Some non-Metro but rail employees took the trains to go to work and return.The second pair of trains ran on a single line in the evening, one after the other. The other line was blocked for a cable job, an official said.The carrier has 24 operational rakes, of which 19 are AC ones.",2020-05-28 21:36:00
700,Subhankar Chowdhury, Coronavirus Lockdown: IIM clears air after lockdown ‘fee’ cry - Telegraph India,"Students of IIM Calcutta have accused it of being “unfair” in charging four executive MBA students who stayed back on the campus after the completion of the course because of the lockdown Rs 500 daily.Some students wrote to the administration on behalf of the four stuck on the campus, saying “it is highly unfair on part of the institute to levy backdated charges on these 4 MBAEx students”.“It is only on 5th May that they have been informed that they may be charged for their stay post April 5…. It is highly unfortunate that the institute had to resort to such predatory practices in these testing times,” they said in their letter.The date of convocation was April 5. An executive MBA student in the 2019-20 batch paid Rs 22 lakh for the year-long course.After Metro enquired with IIM-C director Anju Seth about the charge of Rs 500 and the allegation that the four students had not been allowed to leave campus without making the payment, the director issued a clarification.“I am surprised that these four students have any concern about a fee payment since I have personally assured them that they will not have to face any problem, and also welcomed them to stay as long as they need. No fee will be charged for an involuntary stay, as is only fair to the students. It is completely untrue that anyone has been stopped from leaving the campus for want of payment,” Seth said.A professor said it was unethical to charge the students during such times. “I don’t know what stopped the administration from being generous towards the students who paid Rs 22 lakh,” he said.The outgoing batch has 68 students and of them five remained on the campus. Apart from the four, one person had sought permission before the lockdown for an extended stay because his wife was expecting.Under normal circumstances, the batch would have vacated the campus after collecting the degrees on April 5. The convocation got stalled because of the lockdown.“Unfortunately, owing to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, the four students who were in the final stages of packing and leaving got stranded. We would like to make it very clear that they had no intention of staying back beyond April 5. They did not ‘choose’ to be stranded on campus!” the students said in their letter to the  director.“With regard to these four students, there appears to have been some miscommunication about the permissions they sought and received for an extended stay on campus that in part arose because one of their classmates explicitly sought and received such permission,” director Seth said.",2020-05-28 22:50:00
701,Pinak Ghosh,Wednesday storm adds to telecom misery - Telegraph India,"The storm on Wednesday has lengthened the recovery of the telecom network infrastructure in Calcutta that had already been affected by Cyclone Amphan.Network providers on Thursday struggled to keep services functional in the city after Wednesday’s storm that saw wind speeds more than 90 kmph.Even on Friday, subscribers, particularly in south Calcutta, found it difficult to make voice calls. Telecom operators held two factors responsible: intermittent power at network sites and base transceiver stations resulting in high load at functional units and fibre cuts resulting in a longer recovery period.The third concern, particularly among wired service providers, was the lack of coordination between civic officials overseeing the cutting of trees and service engineers of telecom operators. “Our service engineers are visiting an area more than once to repair cables… and that is making it difficult to cover multiple areas. But we are trying to address all network issues,” an industry executive said.“The network had significantly improved reaching up to 95 per cent plus after the cyclone. The storm on Wednesday has made it challenging,” Rajan Mathews, the director-general of COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India), said. “The downtime at present is primarily because of power-related issues and fibre cuts. This is more prominent in the southern part of Calcutta. Also, recovery in North and South 24-Parganas is expected to take longer.”“The storm has increased the workload of telecom field engineers,” T.R. Dua, the director-general of TAIPA (Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association), said.Background arrangements such as additional DG sets, spare parts, stocking of diesel are being taken care of, Dua said. Cell on Wheel (movable network sites) are being prepared for deployment wherever connectivity is affected, he said.",2020-05-29 21:03:00

Some things haven’t changed, though.TubsThe roof still leaks and on Thursday, at least 10 tubs were placed across the check-in area in the terminal building.Airport officials blamed Cyclone Amphan. Corrugated sheets had been blown away from a large part of the 7,500sq m roof. “The roof has four layers, of which the top layer has been severely damaged by the cyclone. Many joints have been damaged and some have come off,” airport director Kaushik Bhattaharya said on Friday. “It will take up 45 days to repair the entire roof.”Heavy rain between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning sprang more leaks.ToutsA man approached a passenger the moment he stepped out of Gate No. 3A on Thursday. “He asked if I needed a taxi. He left only when I told him I didn’t need any,” the passenger from Mumbai said.Cancer patient Tauser Ali Mandal and his wife Jahanara Mandal reached from Mumbai on Thursday. They were approached by many people as they waited for a car to arrive from their hometown in Nadia’s Tehatta. “They told us that they could arrange a taxi,” Jahanara said on Friday. “One of them insisted he could get a ‘good fair’ depending on the distance. We refused.”Touts had a field day as taxis and app cabs were few, an airport official said. “Although there were several buses, many people wanted a taxi or an app cab.”QueuesLong queues at the entrance to the departure area and in front of check-in counters have returned. The new rules are causing delay and leading to accumulation of passengers, according to airport and airline officials.Yellow lines have been drawn and passengers have been told to stand behind them. But on Friday morning, distancing rules went for a toss on some occasions.There are several new steps at the entrance: baggage sanitisation, temperature check, ticket scanning and identity verification in front of the camera. CISF officers, standing at a distance, are seeing the image of the scanned document on a screen before allowing a passenger to go.",2020-05-29 21:04:00

The empathy shown by a small boy towards humanity is what touched me! As if on a reflex, I just knew that I had to send him the full set of Harry Potter books. And of course there is the saying ‘one good deed begets another’,” Navanita said.“His piggy bank had Rs 500, but his contribution was invaluable and has struck chord with many.

705,Our Special Correspondent,"Young fireman dies in accident, officer held - Telegraph India","A fireman died after a pole crashed on him when a fire tender with his station officer at the wheel slammed into it while reversing on the Tollygunge fire station premises on Friday afternoon.Debnarayan Paul, 22, was taken to a hospital near Ganguly Bagan, where he was declared dead.Police said station master Krishnendu Kundal was driving the fire tender when he suddenly reversed and the vehicle smashed into a badminton net’s pole, which in turn hit Paul on his head.Kundal was taken to Netajinagar police station after some firemen protested against him outside the hospital where Paul was taken. He was later arrested.A police officer said it was not clear whether Kundal could drive or why he was at the wheel of the fire tender. Several firemen accused Kundal of being callous and negligent.“Usually, senior officers do not drive fire tenders. Besides, Kundal does not even know how to drive. We were surprised to see him at the wheel. We were expecting that he would take the vehicle out and so, opened the gate of the station premises. But suddenly, the vehicle backed up and rammed into a pole erected to hold a badminton net. The pole directly hit Debnarayan,” said a firemen who said she saw the accident.“All these points are subject to investigation. We have informed the family of the deceased. If his parents lodge a complaint, we will start a case,” said an officer of Netajinagar police station.Paul, a resident of Nimtala Ghat Street in north Calcutta, joined the fire station a year ago, colleagues said.This was the second fireman’s death in the city within two days.

706,TT Bureau,Coronavirus pandemic: Mamata Banerjee asks private doctors to return - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has urged private doctors to return to their clinics amid allegations that many of them are still refusing to see patients for fear of contracting the novel coronavirus.“I want to tell private doctors — doctors attached to private hospitals and private clinics. Please use PPE kits. Please use sanitisers. Take all the required protection but start seeing some patients,” Mamata said at Nabanna on Friday.“If there are too many people, there could be a problem. You need to put a system in place. Do not grant many appointments on one day. Grant some appointments,” she added.Over a fortnight ago, in the second week of May, the state government had green-lighted reopening of private clinic and OPD units at private hospitals.But while most private clinics in the city are still shut, the OPDs are functioning with a depleted strength. Across Calcutta, doctors in polyclinics and private chambers are not seeing patients.An official of a polyclinic in south Calcutta said that before the lockdown, as many as 60 doctors would see patients in a week. “The count has come down to 12. Those who are not turning up want to wait and watch,” he told Metro.“We are putting pressure on clinical establishments (private hospitals) to restore normality. But they are having their own problems. Many doctors are still not going to private hospitals to see patients,” retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, the regulatory body for private hospitals, said on Friday.An official at a private hospital said the OPDs were not operating in full capacity because of lack of doctors. “ENT, pulmonology and ophthalmology are the departments where the absence is most stark,” said the official. “Elderly doctors are more scared to see patients.”Quarantine unit appealPeople who are protesting opening of quarantine centres in their localities are “inviting danger”, Firhad Hakim, chairman of the board of administrators of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said on Friday.“If people do not allow quarantine centres in their areas, we will not open them. But if someone tests positive from their neighbourhood, that person’s contacts will have no place to be quarantined,” said Hakim said.“People who are protesting against quarantine centres in their neighbourhoods are inviting danger,” Hakim said.",2020-05-29 22:11:00
707,Subhajoy Roy,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Wanted, a tree plantation policy - Telegraph India","The city should have a policy on how to plant saplings, choose species depending on the location and look after trees, naturalists and urban designers said in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan that felled over 5,000 trees in Calcutta.The specialists said trees were the natural barriers that act as the first line of defence against fierce winds, which would otherwise destroy more homes and other infrastructure falling in their way.Haphazard plantation has been the practice so far, along with unplanned or unscientific pruning of trees and leaving the trees to fend for themselves.But specialists are demanding a change and calling for a plantation policy that would address concerns regarding planting saplings and taking care of trees.They are unanimous that tree plantation or pruning should be carried out under the supervision of a panel of specialists who are experienced in urban plantation, to be formed by the civic body.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the specialists said, should immediately talk to people with expertise in the field and prepare a plantation policy since the monsoon, the plantation season, is days away from hitting the city.Any delay will mean a full year will be lost for initiating the process to compensate for the loss of green suffered because of the Amphan.“For years and decades, trees on our footpaths have been left to fend for themselves. They were never cared for, they grew on their own and the authorities only chopped branches when they intruded into homes, blocked traffic lights or when some festival is coming up,” said Arjan Basu Roy, a naturalist and founder of Nature Mates, an NGO that works on nature and environment.He called for a sea change in the approach. The CMC, he thinks, should immediately form a panel tasked with preparing a plantation policy. The panel should comprise naturalists, horticulturalists, scientists, forestry specialists, urban designers and other experts in urban plantation.The panel should be given full authority to decide which trees to be planted and where and how trees need to be trimmed. If needed, a member of the panel can visit a site where trees need to be pruned.“The places that have become vacant after trees fell should be inspected. If it is a narrow space with other trees or streetlights, trees that grow vertically without spreading much should be planted. But if there is space, a tree that spreads and forms a canopy should be preferred,” Basu Roy said.Examples of tall trees that can grow in narrow places are debdaru, jarul, palash and bakul. The ones that can spread and form a canopy include sodal, rosia and tabebuia.Another naturalist said spaces left vacant by fallen trees should be identified quickly and new trees planted. This is necessary to prevent open spaces being encroached on. The concrete top layer should be removed and the soil cleared of impurities like metals or chunks of concrete, which are common beside roots of trees standing on Calcutta’s footpaths.An inspection of several uprooted trees in the city showed that their roots had gone down hardly 2ft or 3ft underground. This, many tree experts felt, was a reason why Calcutta’s trees topple so frequently and after every storm.At least eight trees were uprooted on Wednesday, when a storm clocking nearly 100kmph hit Calcutta.Urban designer Debatosh Sahu said that during plantation, a 3-4ft deep trench must be dug and a metal jacket inserted in it. “The roots of the tree should be allowed to go down vertically for at least 3-4ft and then allowed to spread. Most trees on our pavements have their roots spreading right from where the roots begin,” said Sahu.If the roots go down vertically for some length and then spread, the anchorage would be much stronger and the trees able to withstand strong winds, he said.",2020-05-29 22:12:00
708,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Drive to get trees back on their feet - Telegraph India,"As many as 100 trees that were uprooted on the Rabindra Sarobar premises when Cyclone Amphan was blowing through the city on May 20 could be restored, urban development minister Firhad Hakim said on Friday.Hakim inspected the lake premises on Friday, along with officials and engineers of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the custodian of the park.The CMDA has done an initial assessment of the trees that had inclined or been uprooted by the cyclone. Naturalists, botanists and environmentalists have been engaged for restoration.  They will conduct more inspections to finalise the list of the trees that can be restored.A CMDA official said about 150 trees fell on the 192-acre campus, 119 acres of which are land and the rest water. “A hundred of them could be restored,” Hakim said.Arjan Basu Roy, a naturalist who is involved in restoration of trees at Rabindra Sarobar, said the headload — branches and leaves towards the top — of trees would have to be chopped off for restoration.“Besides, the wounded and torn roots have to be treated with anti-fungal chemicals. The soil around the roots have to be cleaned of all impurities like concrete chunks. It is then that the trees will be pulled up with cranes and restored,” he said.“It would take about 10 days to complete work. But because of unforeseen circumstances, it seems the restoration work may take some more time.”The trees that were uprooted with a considerable amount of soil attached to the roots and have remained so for the last 10 days are easier to restore, said a botanist.“These trees are drawing nutrition from the soil still attached to the roots. If we pull them up and take care of them, many of the trees will survive. Also, trees that are between 15ft and 25ft tall and has a standard girth are easier to restore...,” said O.N. Maurya, the deputy director of the Botanical Survey of India, who is among the specialists engaged in restoration work at Rabindra Sarobar.Maurya said restoration of indigenous plants would be easier as they have been exposed to the local soil conditions for ages. “The focus should also be on restoration of exotic trees that are fewer in number,” he said.A naturalist said restoration meant that trees would be pulled up and restored to their pre-Amphan position. This is different from transplantation, which involves transporting a tree to a new location.A CMDA official said Hakim, who is also chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, asked the team involved in restoration to find out whether some of the toppled trees along Southern Avenue or inside boulevards could be made to stand again.The CMDA is also assessing the condition of 43 trees that were toppled inside Subhas Sarobar — in Beleghata, off EM Bypass — to find out how many can be restored. Hakim will visit Subhas Sarobar — spread across 100 acres — on Monday.“These are two green islands in our city. The large number of trees is what makes them so special. We cannot afford to lose this green cover,” the CMDA official said.",2020-05-29 22:13:00

Defining and identifying the areas in Calcutta was left to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.Relaxation of lockdown restrictions depends on whether a locality is in a clean, buffer or affected area. No shops can be opened and no one can enter or leave an affected area/containment zone without a valid reason.On the other hand, a large number of activities are allowed in clean areas, where no case has been reported in the last 21 days, a CMC official said.The establishments that can be opened in clean areas are fuel stations, all kinds of shops, salons, industrial units, jute mills, hotels and restaurants (only for home delivery). Running of passenger vehicles and construction of buildings are also allowed.A notification issued by the Bengal government late on Saturday evening said malls and restaurants could be allowed to reopen from June 8.In buffer areas, all activities that are allowed in a clean area are permitted, but with 25 per cent staff strength.A list of affected areas/containment zones is available on the CMC’s website but there is no such list for buffer and clean areas.“The list for clean and buffer areas is being prepared. Once ready, it will be uploaded on the CMC’s website,” said an official.A lowdown on roughly home many buildings will be brought under the classification of buffer area or affected area if someone tests positive, based on CMC notifications and what officials saidHousing complexAffected areaAccording to a circular of the CMC issued on May 22, if someone living in a housing complex with multiple towers test positive, only the tower where the person lives will be considered a containment zone/affected area. People living in this tower will remain confined in their homes for 14 days. Those living in other towers of the complex can go out for work, said an official.Buffer areaThe entire housing complex will be considered a buffer area.Large standalone buildingAffected areaThe entire building where a person is testing positive will be classified as an affected area but not the lanes around it or adjacent buildings. The CMC’s circular does not mention what is a large standalone building or how many storeys such a structure must have. A CMC official said officials of the civic health department and police would take a call on a case-by-case basis.Buffer areaTen buildings on all sides will come under the buffer area.Small standalone buildingAffected areaIf the building where a person is testing positive is in a small lane, the entire lane will be classified as an affected area. The CMC’s circular does not mention what should be the length of a lane for it to be classified as small. If the lane is quite long, five buildings on all sides of the building where a Covid-19 patient lives will be tagged as affected.Buffer areaTen buildings on all sides will be part of the buffer area.Hutment in a slumAffected area“All hutments on common passage” where the affected hutment is situated will be considered an affected area, which will include washrooms, toilets and water taps.Buffer areaThe entire slum.",2020-05-30 21:40:00

Most of the students in these schools are from other states, the principal of a school in Darjeeling said.Many students of day schools, too, had gone to other cities before the lockdown came into force.Gerry Arathoon, the chief executive and secretary of CISCE, said students who want to change their exam centres would have to appeal to the council for permission through their respective schools.Mahesh Yatra offThe more than 600-year-old Mahesh rath yatra will not be held this year, in keeping with a decision taken by the organising committee and the Bengal government to avoid mass gatherings to stem the spread of Covid-19.The rath yatra will be celebrated on June 23.“It was the 624th rath yatra of Mahesh this year.

By Monday, the regional transport offices in Salt Lake, Beltala, Alipore and Behala will be sanitised.“No one will be allowed to enter without masks and there will be sanitisers at counters and help desks at all these offices,” the official said.Falling revenue was another reason for the government’s decision to reopen transport offices, sources said.“Revenues of several hundreds of crores had stopped reaching the coffers ever since these offices had been shut down because of the lockdown,” said a senior official of the state government. “No vehicle has been registered for two months. Even fitness tests have not been carried out on vehicles.

Senior monks said the gates were unlikely to be reopened before a fortnight.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Friday said places of worship could reopen from June 1 with a ceiling of 10 devotees at a time.Belur Math, spread across 40 acres on the western bank of the Hooghly, had shut its gates to devotees on March 15, 10 days before the nationwide lockdown came into force.Swami Suvirananda, the general secretary of the Math and Mission, told Metro: “We will open the gates to our friends and devotees after all necessary measures, both modern and traditional, have been put in place to check the spread of the coronavirus.”Primarily, it has been decided that the temples of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda would be opened for darshan. Several other temples such as the old shrine and the temple of Swami Brahmananda, along with the museum, are likely to be off the list even when visitors are allowed on the Math premises.Devotees will be taken on a tour to the shrines that will be opened and later handed dry prasad. The visitors will then be taken out of the Math in batches.The visiting time in the morning will be reduced to two hours initially.Darshan of Swami Smaranananda, the president of the order, will not be allowed in the initial months. Several monks said normal functioning was unlikely to resume before Puja.“The headquarters also house a monastery where very senior monks live. While ensuring the safety of the visitors, we will also have to ensure the well-being of these monks,” said a senior monk. “So, every aspect of health and hygiene will be taken into consideration before the gates are finally opened.”Before the lockdown, around 6,000 devotees would visit Belur Math.

They will have to make way for others and the usher will help others to come and pray,” archbishop Thomas D’Souza told Metro.The churches will reopen after more than two months but the archbishop has said the guidelines of the government and the archdiocese have to be followed strictly.The churches under the archdiocese of Calcutta are St  Thomas’ Church, Church of Christ the King and St Teresa’s Church.The archbishop’s circular has been sent to more than 65 churches under the archdiocese and addressed to the clergy, consecrated persons and lay people.The circular says: “Those who enter the church must use hand sanitiser, wear a mask and keep physical/social distance of minimum 6ft.”It says the parish priest/ priest in charge will take responsibility for “organising orderly entry to and exit from the church”.They will also appoint the usher and one or two people to provide hand sanitiser to devotees at the entrance to the church.The archbishop has also mentioned in the circular that there will be “no meetings or gatherings of people outside the church”.The Blessed Sacrament will be exposed in all churches  of the archdiocese so that people can spend some time in prayer.“From Monday there will be a service in the church but at no time there will be more than 10 people. During the last nine weeks, apart from a few days and in a few places, there was no service,” said Father Dominic Gomes, vicar general, of the archdiocese of Calcutta.",2020-05-30 21:51:00
714,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 18ft trees to take the place of fallen ones in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Trees aged between three and 10 years and reared in the state forest department’s tall tree nurseries will be replanted in the spots where trees were felled by Cyclone Amphan, civic officials said.The decision was taken at a meeting held at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters on Saturday.“Trees that are up to 18ft tall or equal to the height of a one-and-a-half-storey building will be transplanted,” said a state government official who attended the meeting.It was proposed at the meeting that the CMC and the state forest and environment departments would collaborate with each other to plant trees, saplings and seedlings. The existing practice is to leave the task to contractors.Metro reported on Saturday that naturalists and botanists were calling for a scientific plantation policy. They said specialists experienced in nurturing trees must be involved in plantation work.According to an estimate, over 5,000 trees fell while Amphan was howling through the city on May 20.“We will plant a tree in each of the places where old trees got uprooted,” Firhad Hakim, the chairman of CMC’s board of administrators, said on Saturday.The state government official who attended the meeting said the plantation would start from Southern Avenue on June 5, the World Environment Day. Trees from the forest department’s tall tree nurseries in Salt Lake and New Town will be planted along the south Calcutta thoroughfare.Hakim also said the CMC was mulling the idea of entrusting residents or shopkeepers of an area with taking care of trees there.A naturalist said it was impossible for any government or civic body to take care of all trees in a city. “Giving ownership of a tree to a community is a good idea,” he said.HoardingsHakim also said on Saturday that there should be a policy for hoardings in the city. “The policy will decide how many hoardings can be allowed on any road. You put up a hoarding in your house and it can collapse one day during a storm and injure you or someone else. This cannot be allowed,” he said.",2020-05-30 21:52:00

So thinks a man sitting on a sidewalk along Dum Dum Road, near the railway station, with a tray full of masks, plastic face shields and hand sanitisers. Included in his wares was a series of posters in Bengali — on basic hygiene tips to counter Covid-19 — clipped to the carrier and wheels of his bicycle. The tips — wear masks, wash your hands with soap, maintain social distancing, don’t spit and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.If big brands are investing in masks and hand sanitisers, small-time hawkers are trying to leverage Covid-19 in their own way. Many people who have had their livelihood threatened by the lockdown have started selling masks across the city. Most of them do not own a fixed spot. From Ballygunge to Behala, they keep moving, selling cotton masks that cost Rs 20 upwards.On Saturday, a kilometre away from Dum Dum, on Jessore Road in Nagerbazar, another man sold masks on the move. The masks (picture above) were clipped to the edges of his umbrella. Saturday’s maximum temperature was over 35 degrees and the maximum humidity was well over 90 per cent.

The power connection had been disrupted after Cyclone Amphan hit the city on May 20.Over the past two days, a CESC team of 10 men were working to restore permanent supply, said Sudip Deb Chowdhury, the former president of the residents’ association. The linesmen were brought from the CESC service station next to the KPC Medical College and Hospital in Jadavpur on May 23.“We are hiring generators at high rates to pump water to overhead reservoirs,” said Chowdhury.Another resident said the linesmen promised that permanent connection would be restored by Monday.A CESC official said they decided to withdraw the linesmen because they were exhausted. “We had initially decided to deploy these men to Budge Budge in South 24-Parganas. But they were so tired that we allowed them to go home. We decided to send a replacement team to Regent Estate,” the official said.“The replacement team reached Regent Estate around 8pm,” another official of the company said.Problem started when employees of CESC’s Jadavpur office went to Regent Estate around 9am and told the linesmen to head for Budge Budge. As the linesmen were about to leave, residents intervened.The technicians, along with their gear, were taken to a community hall and detained inside. They were allowed to leave at 1.30pm, but without their gear, after a CESC official promised the residents that a replacement team would be sent by Saturday night.“I told the residents it was fine that they had kept power cables and a ladder. The new team would need them,”  the official said.Detaining linesmen till restoration of supply was a common sight in adjoining neighbourhoods such as Netajinagar and Surya Nagar in the aftermath of Amphan.Metro had on Wednesday reported about the perils of temporary connection. Some neighbourhoods where power supply had been restored temporarily on Monday again plunged into darkness the next day.",2020-05-30 22:59:00
717,Our Special Correspondent, Coronavirus pandemic: Post-lockdown bed plea to private units - Telegraph India,"The state government on Saturday asked private hospitals to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients.At a meeting with private hospitals, health department officials also asked the hospitals that are not conducting the Covid-19 test to set up the testing facilities.Officials of some private hospitals who had taken part in the meeting said the health department told them that there could be a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases after the lockdown norms were eased and asked them to set up more beds for such patients and testing facilities.On Saturday, according to the health department, 317 Covid-19 cases were detected in Bengal, taking the total number to 5,130. The state has 8,785 Covid-19 beds.Health department sources said some private hospitals were asked why they were not admitting Covid-19 patients despite several requests.“Although most private hospitals in Calcutta have increased the number of beds for Covid-19 patients, there are a few who are still not accepting patients who have tested positive for the virus. We have asked these hospitals to have more isolation beds and not to refer Covid-19 patients to other hospitals,” said an official of the health department.The health department once again asked the private hospitals to normalise their operations and treat non-Covid patients, too.“The health department said they were still receiving complaints that some of the private hospitals were refusing patients,” said an official of a private hospital.Hospitals said one of the main reasons for refusing patients was shortage of doctors. Many doctors have not yet started seeing patients, which was affecting hospital operations, they said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Friday urged private doctors to return to their clinics. “I want to tell private doctors — doctors attached to private hospitals and private clinics. Please use PPE kits. Please use sanitisers. Take all required protection but start seeing some patients,” Mamata had said.At Saturday’s meeting, the health department clarified that doctors of private hospitals  can recommend home isolation for people testing positive for Covid-19 but have mild or no symptoms. “In that case, the patients have to be under a doctor’s supervision and the private hospital has to be aware of all developments,” an official said.",2020-05-30 23:00:00

Sources said the personnel had specific allegations against an assistant commissioner and an inspector of the battalion.The assistant commissioner has since been transferred.Senior officers who had gone to pacify the agitating cops were attacked with bricks and stones, forcing them to  put their helmets on.Several police officers in Lalbazar said “this kind of behaviour in a disciplined force” was unacceptable. “This is not the right away to register your grievances,” said an officer.A suspended police officer is barred from performing duty and paid half of his or her salary till the departmental proceedings are on.According to the rules, the person is barred from wearing the uniform but has to go to his reporting authorities periodically to mark his attendance.If the person is acquitted at the end of the proceedings, the salary he had been deprived of is reimbursed, said a senior officer.The process of identifying the key policemen behind the trouble started on Saturday morning.The Calcutta police commissioner on Saturday morning told his subordinates to ensure that police personnel be given their quota of leave without any delay and that they should be transferred regularly according to rules.“CCL (compensatory casual leave) should be given to all police personnel without further delay and excuse.

In the majority of cases, the calls had come from Jamtara.The district in Jharkhand, which shares its border with Bengal, has become infamous for fraudulent online activities that have left many Calcuttans poorer.Earlier this year, Calcutta police had arrested several youths from Jamtara for their alleged involvement in multiple tele-calling cases that were reported across the city.Police officers said the Jamtara gang had shifted its focus from ATM cards to masks and sanitisers during the Covid-19 pandemic.The officers said they had received around six-seven such cases in the past few weeks and most of the calls were found to have originated from Jamtara.Sources said one of the recent complainants — a dance troupe — had ordered liquid disinfectant from a company based in Jabalpur, whose contact number they had found on an online portal. After transferring a part of the money, the complainant had found that although there was a company by that name in Jabalpur, the phone number of the contact person was different.“On dialling the landline of the company, a member of the troupe discovered that the company had not received any order from the troupe. It became clear that some fraudster had registered his mobile number with details of the Jabalpur company,” said an officer.In another case, the complainant had placed a bulk order for N95 masks and hand sanitisers worth Rs 4 lakh through an online portal and paid the entire amount in advance. The consignment was never delivered, police sources said.The police learnt that the mobile numbers used for fraudulent transactions had been in use in Jamtara and its adjoining areas.A senior officer at Lalbazar said fraudsters from Jamtara had been changing their mode of operation from time to time depending on the circumstances.“A few days ago, when sale of liquor was not permissible, they targeted people by claiming they would sell liquor online. Now they have shifted to masks and sanitisers,” the officer said.The officer added they were requesting everyone to be aware of the phishing techniques and place an online order only from reputable portals.",2020-05-30 23:10:00

That could cause damage to life and property,” said Tushar Jaiwsal, managing director of Jaiswal Construction Equipments that owns the machines.At the crane’s controls sat Mohammed Farzan Hussain, a veteran of 18 years who offered Id prayers in the morning before setting out. “Although I wanted to celebrate with my family I did not think twice before coming here as it was an emergency.

It took all my experience to ensure they didn’t swing out of control today while men worked underneath. I was praying the whole time,” said Hussain, whose own home in Barrackpore was without power at the time.As the cranes lifted the trees, a team of firemen prepared to slice through the branches. “It was all the more difficult as there was a maze of overhead wires,” said station officer of the Sector V fire station Sudipto Mukherjee.

724,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Watchman on the waterfront - Telegraph India,"As a young boy growing up in his uncle’s house in Behrampore in Murshidabad district in the sixties and seventies, Debashis Chaudhury could not help getting caught in a cross-current of ideas. His uncle Soumendra Kumar Gupta, known for his radical views, taught political science at Behrampore Krishnanath College.  Naxalbari, which was not far away, had just happened. All around Chaudhury were scholars, writers and activists, dreaming of a new world. Chaudhury would never engage directly with a political movement, but he was baptised by fire.Today, at 62, he still tries to give shape to those ideas, far from Behrampore and his childhood, in Diamond Harbour. After earning his masters degree in botany from Ballygunge science college, Chaudhury landed up at Diamond Harbour as a teacher of biology and life science at Sarisha High School. Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas, once an important harbour town for the Potuguese and the British, now serves as a gateway to the Sunderbans and is a local tourist destination. Here, the Rupnarayan joins the Hooghly to be met by Haldi further down and the three join to run into the sea in the Sunderbans further south.“I came here and stayed on,” says Chaudhury, a modest man with a smiling face. The town became his mission. He is a Diamond Harbour activist. Just before the lockdown, he was working hard to build a campaign against the CAA and NRC.Chaudhury points at the river. Cyclone Amphan has breached the embankment on the Hooghly at Matsabandar near Diamond Harbour for about 200 metres. Last year, the main tourist attraction of the town, the promenade on the riverfront that is also part of the main road, had been threatened with collapse by a state government project to build a hanging bridge there.The project was shelved after protests from Janakalyan Samiti, Diamond Harbour, a civic, social and human rights group that was formed by Chaudhury and others in 2002, which were reported by The Telegraph. Previously Chaudhury was a member and secretary of APDR, a Calcutta-based civil and human rights group.“But hardly any repair has been done. A disaster may still be waiting,” says Chaudhury about the battered stretch. “Though what the eye can see is very little.”Diamond Harbour town lies ravaged with its houses roofless and without walls. In the villages the destruction is unbelievable. And Covid is raging. “For so long governments in Bengal had been told to decentralise power more effectively. A strong local government would have helped in people’s participation in health infrastructure. Who even knows about the Gram Samsad now?” asks Chaudhury.But Diamond Harbour was never really pretty. “I came here in 1981. The town was always in a state of collapse, irrespective of who was in power,” says Chaudhury, who retired from his job in 2018.  One of the first things that he saw was the large spurt of ‘video-halls’ in the early 80s showing blue films. “There were about 20/22 such halls in the town itself and schoolboys were making a beeline for these.” These were closed down, as were some hotels that were being used for prostitution, after intervention from Chaudhury and other activists.“I was never directly engaged with a political group,” Chaudhury stresses. “But Naxalbari had opened a door. And at that point the science movement was working in a parallel way.” Movements come together. Science, also, is a great agent of change.In those days Chaudhury would distribute a science journal called Utsa Manush in Diamond Harbour homes.Wherever he looked, problems had piled up. “Water in Diamond Harbour is undrinkable. It has always been so. Not many here drink the water supplied by municipality,” said Chaudhury. “Just the other day, my wife pointed out snails in the water. So everyone buys 20-litre jars of bottled water, the quality of which can also be questioned in many cases,” said Chaudhury. His wife is a schoolteacher and the couple have two sons.Chaudhury filed a petition against authorities on the issue of unsafe and unclean drinking water at the high court in 2017, but the case has only had one hearing so far.For Janakalyan Samitiand Chaudhury, the local bridges are another important issue.Diamond Harbour is a town of bridges. These, joining parts of town and often entire areas over water bodies that abound in this part of Bengal, are vital to life here. Some go back to the British era. Many of them have collapsed, or are about to.“Natunpole is the bridge that connects Diamond Harbour with Kakdwip in the Sunderbans. It has been in very bad shape for long, but recently it was ‘repaired’ with only a coat of plaster,” said Chaudhury. Same for Lalpole, a British-era bridge, a little distance from Natunpole. “It has collapsed. But still people are using it, clearing a space on the side. That is another disaster waiting to happen.”The Mograhat Canal, over which Natunpole was built and which acts as an irrigation canal for a large area around Diamond Harbour, has not been cleaned since 1967, said Chaudhury. He has filed more than a hundred RTIs so far, individually and on behalf of organisations, but has got only about seven or eight satisfactory replies.Not that he has been rewarded grandly for his efforts in fact the opposite has happened at times. Once he had begun to give extra lessons to students at the higher secondary level. The idea was also to hit at the root of the private tuition racket that flourished there. He was harassed and beleaguered for his effort.“We have our limitations,” said Chaudhury. “Not all of us can give up our jobs. But one of the things I always remember is if you don’t try to change society around you, society will change you.”",2020-05-31 21:07:00

At least 53 kites, 76 half-finished spools and 63 ready to use spools were seized. All had manjha rolled over them.The raids started on Saturday after Sheikh Abdul Salam, 29, a resident of Picnic Garden Road, suffered nose injuries from kite string despite wearing a helmet.It is difficult to ascertain if any of the injuries or death caused by kite strings can be linked to the kite and spool manufacturers arrested on Saturday, an officer said. “We wanted to send out a message… the manufacture and sale of kites and spools near flyovers will not be allowed.”",2020-05-31 21:13:00

All store owners have been asked to ensure there is a minimum of 6ft distance between two people, be they employees or customers.The traders association has told store owners that those found violating any rule will be warned thrice before shutting down the store.“There are stores of various sizes in New Market. We have asked the owners of stores that are around 100sq ft to ensure there are not more than two people inside the store at any point of time. The owner of the store opposite has been asked to keep a watch,” Uday Kumar Shaw, the general secretary of SS Hogg Market Traders Association, said.Three volunteers from among employees and store owners will be doing the rounds of each of the 12 blocks in the old and new complexes of the market. The volunteers will be on the lookout for violators.After having lost business during Id and Bengali New Year’s Day, traders in New Market are banking on Durga Puja shopping. “We do not want to lose business for Durga Puja… for that we traders have to be very careful. If anyone from among employees of stores test positive for Covid-19, the entire market will be shut down for 21 days. We cannot afford that,” Shaw said.Standalone shops in the New Market area are thinking of extending their business hours from Monday. Nasim Ahmed, the owner of Selection, a store near the crossing of Lindsay Street and Bertam Street that sells mobile phones and watches, said he planned to keep the store open for six-seven hours from Monday.“I have been opening the store since Thursday. But with New Market opening from Monday, we are expecting more customers. I kept my shop open for three hours for the past few days… from Monday I want to keep my store open for 6-7 hours,” Ahmed said.Treasure Island and Simpark Mall, though, will not open from Monday, Ahmed, who is also a member of the Joint Traders Forum, said.The forum is an association of several market associations in the New Market area.",2020-05-31 21:13:00

This is why our teams are asking people who had planted the tree even if it is on a pavement or a divider in front of the house. The cyclone has left a trail of destruction that nobody could have imagined and we are focusing on clearing out the roads and other public places, including parks, first. It will take our teams at least a few months to set things right,” Chakraborty said.Snigdha Mitra, 61, who stays alone in a two-storey house at AE block, said a tree had been leaning on her home but civic workers did not remove it in spite of her requests.Mitra’s daughter Saimantika Munshi said she was worried that the tree might come crashing down anytime.The mother and daughter requested another team that visited the block on Saturday to remove another uprooted tree. But the team apparently said the tree was “too big” for it to handle.Trees have either fallen on buildings or are leaning on them in several blocks, including AE, EE, AD, AC, BC and DL.Several residents said the civic body could have done more. Debarjun Saha, who stays in a two-storey house in BC block with his family, said he was scared for his children’s safety as a Krishnachura tree was hanging dangerously over their balcony from a median divider.“The branches of the tree have landed on the balcony and the top end of the trunk is a few feet away.

The Centre’s fresh guidelines issued on Saturday had said a decision on reopening educational institutions would be taken only in July.“The buildings of 7,000 institutions — colleges and schools — are being used to quarantine migrant workers,” education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Sunday.A vice-chancellor of a state university said that the VCs wanted to extend the closure because time was needed to decide how to run classes while following distancing rules.Another vice-chancellor said “elaborate arrangements” had to be made regarding the sanitisation of classrooms before classes could be held.“We have to make arrangements to run temperature checks with thermal scanners at the gate before letting in students. We need to train employees on how to read temperatures on such scanners,” the vice-chancellor said.The department has advised universities and the colleges to ensure hand sanitisers are available in every corner of the campus.Another VC said he was worried about hostels.Students from districts stay in hostels. The hostels have to be sanitised before letting them in, he said. “We have to decide how many students can be accommodated in a room.”The earlier practice of accommodating three students in a room has to be done away with, a higher education department official said.Although hostels will remain closed till June 30, institutes authorities will have to make adequate arrangements following medical protocol for foreign students who could not leave the campus, mainly because of transport unavailability during the lockdown.The fact that college and school buildings are being used to quarantine migrant workers also prompted the government to extend the closure, another department official said.The government has requested the ICSE and CBSE to keep their institutions shut till June 30. ",2020-05-31 21:24:00
733,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Demand and threat over bus fares by private operators - Telegraph India,"Private bus operators on Sunday demanded an independent regulator to fix their fares and refused to return to roads unless the government okayed a fare hike.The regulatory body should be along the lines of the one that decides power tariff, the operators said. It should assess the market realities and factor in various cost components such as fuel price, road taxes, and maintenance cost to arrive at a fare structure, they said.So far, the state government has fixed bus and taxi fares.“It is impossible to return to roads in the existing fare structure,” Tapan Bandyopadhyay of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said. “The government should leave the task of fixing fares on a regulatory commission.”On May 29, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that buses would be allowed to run with all passengers seated (standing not allowed) from June 1.She had earlier said buses could run with only 20 passengers on board. Operators had rejected the proposal then, too.It will not be viable to run buses if passengers are not allowed to stand, operators said.So far, only state-run buses have been plying on select routes.“The government, too, is incurring losses. Now, buses will be allowed to run to full seating capacity. But standing will not be allowed on buses. Hand sanitisers have to be given to passengers and masks are mandatory,” the chief minister had said.Close to 9,000 private buses ply in Calcutta and adjoining areas. Bus fares were revised last in 2018.It will not be feasible to run buses even with full seating capacity because most bus owners have been struggling for the past two months to pay EMIs on loans they had taken to buy the vehicles, apart from bearing maintenance cost, private bus operators said on Sunday.The government should make arrangements to waive certain fees, including that of permit renewal, apart from revising the fares,” Rahul Chatterjee of Bus Minibus Samannoy Samity said. “It is a question of survival.”Private bus operators had earlier proposed a fare revision with the minimum fare ranging from Rs 15 to Rs 20.At present, the minimum bus fare is Rs 7.“We have already increased the fleet strength of state buses. Next week, we will review the situation and decide on the next step,” a transport department official said.",2020-05-31 21:25:00

They were found lying listless in the debris of fallen trees, inside parks and some on roads.Many birds had weaved their nests on scores of trees lining Bhowanipore Ladies Park this spring. The trees included Krishnachura, Palash, Jamun and Radhachura. About a third of those have been uprooted, while the rest have had branches broken in the cyclone.Days after the storm, people saw the nesters hopping from one broken branch to another, looking for their homes. Some of the neatly woven nests were on the paved paths while some hung precariously on to broken branches and some had simply vanished.Bird watcher Sujan Chatterjee, to whom Metro had sent pictures, identified some of the birds as White-breasted Kingfisher, Magpie Robin, Red-vented Bulbul and Lesser Golden-backed Woodpecker.A day after the storm, a 26-year-old bird lover went to a park beside a large water body near his home in Behala Chowrasta, home to many trees, to check on the nests and their occupants. He saw dead and injured birds in equal numbers. “Many of the dead birds were herons,” Priyam Chattopadhyay, a software engineer, said.Chattopadhyay called up members of a local club — part of a nature lovers’ group. Together, they rescued 17 birds and provided them with a temporary shelter inside the club.Chattopadhyay called up an NGO the next day. A volunteer turned up and took the birds.Kashmira Mullick, a student in Taltala, rescued a kite that had fallen from its roost after the storm.Mullick, a post-graduate course student of political science at Calcutta University, spotted the kite lying near the driveway of her house. “The bird was unable to fly. I gave it some water and some pieces of chicken before alerting the wildlife rescue centre in Salt Lake.A team from the centre took the bird.“The number of trees uprooted and partially damaged in Calcutta, Salt Lake and neighbouring areas stands at more than 10,000,” Suvrajyoti Chatterjee, the secretary of Human and Environment Alliance League, an NGO, said. “Even if most of the trees had one nest and even if each nest had just two chicks, imagine the loss of life and habitat.”The NGO works for animals.The phones of several NGOs kept ringing for the next two days after the storm. Most callers said they had rescued birds. The NGOs sent their volunteers to these people to collect the birds. Some of the rescued birds could fly on their own after basic treatment, food and water.The rescued birds included egrets, herons, barbets, kites, owls and woodpeckers, Chatterjee said.At least 120 birds were sent to the Wild Animal Rescue and Transit Facility Centre in Salt Lake. Some of them were critically injured and did not survive.“We have kept close to 100 birds in a 40ftX40ft enclosure. Many of the birds are juveniles. They are being given small fish and other food and glucose-laced water,” Manoj Jash, the ranger at the facility, said.For the birds still in the open, the loss of habitat poses a big challenge.“They will try and find nesting places in the surviving trees. If they can’t find any, they will disappear. There will be a lot of competition because their habitat has dwindled. The fittest will survive,” birdwatcher Chatterjee said.Calcutta with its tropical humid climate is prone to regeneration, the birder said. “But we should start replanting trees soon,” he said.Additional reporting by Snehal Sengupta",2020-05-31 21:26:00
736,Mita Mukherjee,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Bengal govt seeks damage report from colleges - Telegraph India,"The government has asked state-aided colleges to submit detailed reports on damage to their institutions caused by Cyclone Amphan.The institutions have been asked to specify the approximate money and time they would need to complete repairs, a higher education department official said.The university exams will have to be conducted at many of the affected colleges in mid-July.The worst-hit colleges are mostly in South 24-Parganas (Maheshtala, Canning, Raidighi, Kakdwip and Sagar Island) and in parts of North 24-Parganas, the official said. Several colleges in Calcutta, too, have been “severely damaged”, the official said.The government will assess the damage once colleges send their reports and appropriate action will be taken to complete the repair work at the earliest, education minister Partha Chatterjee said. “Colleges are sending their reports. Appropriate steps will be taken to ensure they start functioning at a suitable time.”At Lady Brabourne College, laboratories, computers, windowpanes, solar panels,  the boundary wall, two staff quarters, and hostel buildings have been damaged, according to principal Shiuli Sarkar.The extent of damage is close to Rs 5 lakh, Sarkar said.Rajasree Neogi, principal of Bijoygarh College in Golf Green, said the college had been affected by the cyclone.The storm blew away a corrugated tin roof of one of the buildings. The boundary wall has been damaged by a tree that fell on it, Neogi said. “It will take several weeks to complete the repairs and bring back the campus to normality.”All colleges near or in the Sunderbans area have suffered “extensive damage”, the higher education department official said.",2020-05-31 21:27:00
737,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus outbreak: New Town seeks resident volunteers  - Telegraph India,"The township authorities have invited residents to volunteer in the fight against the coronavirus.Volunteers can choose from 18 options that range from buying and delivering medicines in their localities, managing queues at markets in order to ensure social distancing, driving others in times of emergency and delivering food to pavement dwellers and migrant labourers at various construction sites near their homes, an official of the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) said.Those willing to be part of the group of volunteers can log on to the NKDA website: www.nkdamar.org and register themselves, the official said.The idea to include residents in a regular volunteer force that will be active across all three action areas of the township was accepted after NKDA officials held a series of teleconferences with many New Town residents.One the one hand, a large part of the population consists of elderly residents who stay alone while on the other there are residents eager to step out and help, Debashis Sen, the NKDA chairman, said.“We decided to have a well-organised team of volunteers who will join hands with Hidco and NKDA officials to form a sustainable team capable of giving outputs over a period of times,” Sen said. “For example, we have a helpline where requests are pouring in to home-deliver medicines. We can ask a volunteer who stays closest to the address from where the request was raised to deliver them.”The teams will be asked to help people in their neighbourhood instead of travelling large distances, keeping in mind the restrictions because of the lockdown, he said.Once the registration is over, NKDA officials will videoconference with volunteers to guide them on what they have to do, Sen said. The officials will train them and allot specific tasks under the supervision of an NKDA task force.According to an official WhatsApp groups of volunteers will be created for each locality so that they can “better coordinate” among themselves, according to officials.Saptarshi Roy, a resident of New Town's Action Area I, said he had signed up on the NKDA website to be part of the volunteer group. “I am doing my own bit by feeding stray animals in our locality and I am glad that somebody actually thought of bringing people, who want to work for the community, together.”",2020-06-04 22:15:00
739,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Good deeds in the time of coronavirus outbreak in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Many such patients in Calcutta and on the outskirts have been finding it difficult to travel to clinics run by Calcutta Rescue, an NGO that provides free healthcare and medicine to those who cannot afford them. The CEO of the NGO, Jaydeep Chakraborty, and a few of his employees have been travelling to various locations to deliver medicines to patients.“We have shortlisted high-priority patients who would suffer significantly if we did not reach out to them and decided to drive down to give them medicines. We have asked a few others to buy medicines from state hospitals or local pharmacies, for which we will reimburse the cost. But there are many who have to travel long distances because the medicines are very expensive or not locally available,” Chakraborty said.A group of schoolboys pooling in money to buy ration for daily wage earners, NGO workers driving down several kilometres to provide medicines to the chronically ill — the lockdown has made a good Samaritan of many. Travel far and wide A 21-year-old boy fighting leukaemia ran out of his monthly medicines in Joynagar, South 24-Parganas. A woman in her 30s suffers from a chronic ailment where the immune system mistakenly attacks platelets, leading to profuse bleeding. She has to travel from her home at Gocharan in South 24-Parganas to a clinic in Tallah every month for free medicines but the lockdown left her in a lurch.The delivery service has been tough to organise because drivers working with the NGO could not turn up because of the lockdown. Yet, Chakraborty and his team managed to reach about 200 patients.Schoolboys turn SamaritansThree schoolchildren with the strength and help of 37 more travelled to the slums of Salt Lake on Sunday to deliver rice and potatoes to about 200 families in Duttabad.The list also includes some leprosy patients in the Tangra area, who had to be delivered bandages and medicines.In some homes, the NGO has been distributing grains along with medicines because their source of income has dried up.“Wherever possible we have tried to give two months’ medicines instead of 14 or 28 days. This means fewer visits to our clinic, less congestion and better social distancing measures,” Chakraborty said.The boys, Interact Club members of St James' School, who decided to pool in money about 10 days ago. Forty of them from Classes IX to XII collected Rs 30,000 on Paytm.The president of the club, Yash Chirimar, and two others went to the slums, where most residents are van rickshaw-pullers and house help.“The ration would last them a few days but some of them were so happy to get it. It was just rice and potatoes but we realised how valuable it is to some,” the Class XII student said.The Interact Club has its own fund but since that is in the school account, the boys would have found it difficult to withdraw money from there during the lockdown. “So we decided to pool in money instead,” Chirimar said.",2020-06-04 22:31:00
741,Snehal Sengupta,‘Speeding’ cop car hits house gate in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"A police constable out on a spin lost control of the car near the Baisakhi Island in Salt Lake and crashed into the gate of a house in BG block late on Sunday, police said.Tara Shankar Banerjee, the state police constable posted in Basirhat, was arrested after the owner of the house lodged a complaint with the Bidhannagar East police station.Banerjee was not on duty at the time and could not give any explanation why he was out driving during the lockdown. He has been charged under Section 188 of the IPC for violation of order promulgated by government that carries a punishment of jail time for six months or a fine of Rs 1,000 or both. This section is being used by the police to book lockdown violators. Banerjee has also been charged under IPC Section 279 (rash and negligent driving).There were at least two other men in the Maruti WagonR that Banerjee was driving. Both fled, an officer of Bidhannagar East police station said. Banerjee was pulled out of the vehicle by residents, who had rushed outside on hearing a loud noise.The constable had jumped a signal before the car turned on its side and went on to hit the gate, the officer said.The residents alerted local councillor Anita Mondal, who called police. A police patrol reached the spot and took Banerjee to the Salt Lake sub-divisional hospital, where he was treated for his injuries.Banerjee was headed towards the Kwality Island in Salt Lake’s Sector I from the police housing complex near Baisakhi, police said.“The car was speeding. The driver had tried to take a turn at the Baisakhi roundabout at high speed but lost control of his car. We will question him to find out why he was out driving and if there were others with him,” the officer said.The car’s front bumper had come off while the bonnet was crushed.The front windshield, too, was cracked. The impact also left the iron gate of the house twisted and a pillar damaged, the officer said.“I rushed to the spot on getting a call and a police team arrived soon afterwards. The man was trapped inside the car as it had turned on its side, pinning the door on the driver’s side down. The residents who had gathered there and cops pushed the car back and got him,' Mondal said.Brotin Chakraborty, a BG block resident, said he had stepped out on the balcony for a smoke when he heard tyres screeching, followed by a loud noise. “I saw the car lying on its side, smoke and liquid coming out it. It had landed on the gate of a house. I rushed out and, along with two other residents, tried to push the car back on its wheels and get him out but we could not,” Chakraborty said. More residents gathered and a police team arrived before Banerjee could be pulled out.",2020-06-04 22:42:00
743,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus pandemic: Don Bosco extends closure till April-end - Telegraph India,"Don Bosco School, Park Circus, has extended the closure of the institution till April-end to ensure students’ safety.The school will keep all activities suspended throughout this month, principal Father Bikash Mondal said.“We don’t know whether the lockdown will be extended or not. I think it won’t be safe to ask children to come to school if the lock down is withdrawn after April 15. The safety and health of our students is our priority. So, we have decided to keep the school closed till May,” the principal said.The government had initially announced that all educational institutions would remain closed till March 31. The Prime Minister later announced a 21-day lockdown, till April 14.The notice issued by Don Bosco School to the parents read:  “Due to the uncertainties and closure of all institutions in the city all proposed activities of the school till May remain suspended. The date of opening the schools is still uncertain. Important information will be intimated via Entab.”Entab is an app that runs on a school management software.Several other schools are also wary of reopening their institutions if the lockdown is withdrawn. The principal of a city school said they were in touch with the health department and seeking advice from experts on whether it would be safe to run the school at this stage if the lockdown is lifted.Father Bikash Mondal, of Don Bosco, said though the closure had been extended, the school would “change” the decision if necessary. “We are ready to change the decision if there is an instruction from a higher authority,” he said. The school had distributed report cards to the students and was supposed to start the new session on March 25.In normal situation, the schools would have been closed now for Easter and would have reopened in the middle of next week.“Normal academic activities would have started by the end of next week. So, we thought stretching the closure till the end of this month would not make much difference,” said the principal.",2020-06-04 23:14:00
744,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus lockdown: Pass for ‘extreme emergency’ - Telegraph India,"Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma on Monday asked the officers in charge of the 80 police stations in the city to issue passes to residents of their areas only in “extreme emergencies” such as a death in the family, officers said.Each such pass will have to be counter-stamped by the office of the divisional deputy commissioner, the officers said.Sharma addressed the officers in charge of all police stations through videoconferencing on Monday afternoon and asked them to issue passes only if there is an “extreme emergency”.“The passes have to be counter-stamped by the office of the divisional deputy commissioner from now,” an officer quoted Sharma as saying during the conference.Calcutta police had started two procedures of issuing passes — one is for individuals or organisations involved in delivery of essential supplies and the other for personal use by residents.For the first category of passes, one has to apply online and, if approved, the permit is emailed to the applicant. For the second, a resident has to visit the local police station with an application and collect the permit from an officer. Such passes, police commissioner Sharma told his officers, are to be issued in “extreme emergencies” such as a death in the family and counter-stamped by the office of the divisional deputy commissioner concerned.Till Monday, Calcutta police had received over 30,000 online applications for e-passes. Officers said the number of applications received by the 80 police stations for the other type of passes could be much higher.“Lalbazar is flooded with requests and applications for online passes. But only those with a genuine ground for making such a request are being issued the e-pass. A pass will be valid for a stipulated time,” an officer said.“Some applied for an e-pass to visit the grocery shop. Some want an e-pass to buy medicines.... The applicants whose pleas are being rejected are being sent a text message informing him or her about the decision,” the officer said.Sources said the number of vehicles on the roads had gone up considerably because of the passes. For stricter implementation of the lockdown, the police have put in place a two-layer confirmation before a pass for personal use is issued — first at the local police station and then at the office of the divisional deputy commissioner concerned.A section of the police feels the two-layer verification system has been started to discourage people from asking for passes for trivial reasons.",2020-06-04 23:19:00
745,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus lockdown: Dismal show spurs online attendance check in Calcutta colleges - Telegraph India,"Several colleges in the city are tracking the attendance of students in virtual classes after noticing poor response from them.Colleges will maintain an attendance record, the principal of a college said. Students have been asked to treat online classes as regular ones, the principal said.Most colleges have found at the most 15 per cent response from students till now, according to the principals Metro spoke to on Monday.Students are being reminded about the mandatory 75 per cent attendance to be eligible to take university exams. They have been warned of being marked absent if they don’t attend online classes.Colleges have started online classes after educational institutions in the state closed down to fight the spread of the coronavirus.“Most of our departments are using online facilities like Zoom and LMS or learning management software to offer online lessons. Online classes have been going on for quite some time,” Jaydeep Sarangi, the principal of New Alipore College, said. “But only 10-15 per cent of the students have been attending those classes.”“The response of students to online classes is not satisfactory. Teachers of every department have been asked to maintain a record of students approaching them with queries,” said Asoke Mukhopadhyay, the principal of Seth Anandram Jaipuria College.There are a few colleges, though, which have seen majority of their students attending online classes. Siuli Sar-kar, the principal of Lady Brabourne College, said the response at her college was “very high”.

746,Kinsuk Basu,Tallah demolition resumes in lockdown - Telegraph India,"The demolition work of the Tallah bridge resumed a few days ago to ensure the 57-year-old structure is pulled down by the end of this month.The demolition of the bridge had stopped after the Centre announced a 21-day lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus.The Bengal government had set a 21-month target for the new bridge to come up from the date the site is handed over to the construction company, L&T.Things changed a few days ago when the bridge was listed as a “critical structure” and “exempted” from the lockdown. “We have resumed work of demolishing the spans that stand over the rail tracks following the guidelines of social distancing,” a PWD engineer overseeing the demolition work said.A team of 20 engineers and workers has been readied and split into three shifts to carry out the demolition with the help of a jaw-crusher machine and diamond cutters. The number is almost three times less than the normal count, the engineer said.Every team member has been allocated a room and all have been provided with masks and gloves. Sanitisers have been kept at the work site as well as at the quarters. Meetings with senior engineers are being held on various social media platforms.Engineers have been asked to videoconference with their superiors for any clarification and to give them daily updates, a PWD official said.The challenge lies in pulling down the slabs over the tracks. There are eight such concrete spans, each measuring about 25m in length and 12m in width. The railways has to ensure there is no movement of goods trains when the slabs are pulled down.“The railways has organised for a complete power block since movement of goods, particularly cement and salt, has been stopped because of the lockdown,” a rail official said.A PWD engineer said by April 14 the entire stretch of the bridge over the tracks would be pulled down. In another fortnight the two approaches would be demolished. “We plan to hand over the site to the construction company that will build the new bridge by the first week of May.”The Telegraph had earlier reported about a jaw-crusher machine that has been requisitioned for the job. The jaw-crusher slips concrete chunks within its jaws after ripping them off and crushes them into dust.On Monday, the jaw-crusher machine was in action as it ripped apart concrete spans over the tracks.The company, L&T, will start building the new bridge once the site is handed over to the company, an official in Nabanna said.The old bridge was written off after a government-appointed committee running a health check on bridges and flyovers in the city concluded the structure was unfit to bear vehicular load and had to be demolished.The proposed bridge will have a 24m wide deck - 5.5m more than the existing one. The existing pillars will have to be pulled down and new ones built to bear the load of wider decks, a PWD engineer said.The new Tallah bridge will have a carrying capacity of more than 350 tonnes - 100 tonnes more than the old structure.",2020-06-04 23:33:00

749,Jayanta Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Pollution spike in ‘solidarity’ in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The city’s air and noise pollution levels, which had been below the limits since the lockdown started, took a sudden leap after 9pm on Sunday when people burst firecrackers to show solidarity in the fight against Covid-19. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked people to switch off lights at homes and light candles or flash torches for nine minutes from 9pm on Sunday to show solidarity.In response, residents across the city kept lighting fireworks well past the nine-minute window.The air quality index values and noise pollution data generated jointly by the Bengal pollution control board and the Central Pollution Control Board show a spike in almost all automatic measuring points in the city. A few commercial areas such as New Market were exceptions.The peak noise level measured on the instantaneous scale, which reflects the change in the ambient noise level following the sudden bursting of crackers, rose by 6 decibel on April 5 between 8pm and midnight, compared with the same duration on March 29 (the previous Sunday). The lockdown announced by the state government had started on March 23 and the nation-wide lockdown, announced by the Prime Minister, the next day.The rise was maximum — 29 decibel — in the RG Kar hospital area, a silent zone, where the peak value was 72 decibel, 32 more than the night-time limit of 40. An official in the environment department said an increase of 10 decibel in ambient noise doubles the pressure on one’s eardrums.While the noise levels increased by 6 to 8 decibel in Birati, Taratala and Salt Lake, the increase was marginal in Tollygunge and Patuli. The levels remained almost unchanged around SSKM Hospital and New Market.On the air pollution front, the air quality index (AQI) value peaked to 140 in Jadavpur between 9pm and 10pm. The whole-day average was 80, almost a 75 per cent increase.The AQI values increased substantially in Salt Lake and at Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road) — by 41 per cent (from the day’s average of 69 to 98, recorded between 9pm and 10pm) and 58 per cent (from the day’s average of 96 to 152, recorded between 9pm and 10pm), respectively.Most automatic air pollution measuring centres recorded a sharp rise in PM2.5, the most toxic air pollutant, and sulphur dioxide after 9pm.“It was like a mini-Diwali last night,” said cardio-thoracic surgeon Kunal Sarkar, who lives in the Alipore area.“First, it proved how insensitive a section of people are in the society. Moreover it needs to be probed how these illegal fireworks were procured despite the lock down” said Biswajit Mukherjee, retired chief law officer of the state pollution control board. ",2020-06-04 23:50:00
750,Subhajoy Roy,Go to only coronavirus hospitals: Bengal CM - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged people with symptoms of Covid-19 to visit only designated hospitals for coronavirus patients such as MR Bangur Hospital.Mamata’s call came after about 75 medical service providers, including around 30 doctors, of the NRS Medical College and Hospital were quarantined for being exposed to a Covid-19 patient.Mamata said people with Covid-19 symptoms — such as fever, dry cough and/or respiratory troubles — should visit MR Bangur Hospital, where all facilities for treating such patients have been created.“I will request everyone who has such symptoms (of Covid-19) to go directly to MR Bangur Hospital. A mechanism to treat such patients is ready there. Please do not go to NRS Hospital, Calcutta Medical College or SSKM Hospital,” she said.“A patient with pneumonia went to NRS hospital. He died and after his death it became known that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Now, all doctors and nurses are worried since the man tested positive. Doctors and nurses need to be in good health,” she said. The chief minister’s statement came on a day the NRS authorities sealed the male general ward and the critical care unit where the Covid-19 patient was admitted. He died on Saturday.Mamata did not say why she was urging people with symptoms of coronavirus infection to not visit  hospitals that have not been designated as Covid-19 hospitals.But doctors said it could be because of the incident at NRS hospital and the fact that a large number of healthcare professionals had to be quarantined.“In a situation like this, losing the service of 30 doctors and many more nurses and other health-service providers is a big blow. I think the chief minister urged people with symptoms to visit only Covid hospitals keeping that in mind,” said a state government doctor.  The person who died at NRS was in his 30s, said a state government official. He was admitted with problems of a blood disorder. Since there were no tell-tale signs of Covid-19, doctors kept him in the male general ward and later shifted him to the critical care unit when his condition worsened.As doctors did not find any symptoms in him, they treated him the way they are treating any non-Covid patient, without taking any extra precautions, said the official.When the youth showed symptoms of Covid-19, they sent his samples for tests. “He tested positive. The report came after his death. That is why all health-care providers who were exposed to him have been sent to a quarantine centre,” said the official. Officials said all medical records of the youth would be sent to a five-member expert committee set up by the state health department. The committee will examine all the documents and decide whether the patient died of Covid-19 or because of some co-morbidities. Metro reported on Monday that the state government had set up four Covid-19 hospitals in the city. The hospitals together have 1,425 beds — MR Bangur Hospital has 1,100 beds, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (New Town) 192 beds,  Beleghata ID hospital has 82 beds and AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake has 51 beds.“A person with fever or any other symptom of Covid-19 can visit the clinics at these hospitals,” an official said.",2020-06-04 23:55:00
751,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown takes mutton off menu in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Calcuttans are having to do with poultry meat during the lockdown because mutton, the star in the city’s culinary lore, has mostly gone off the menu.Most retail shops selling mutton are shut. The wholesalers and big retailers across the city are left with either minuscule or zero stock. For the time being, they are only supplying to restaurants that are delivering food via online food aggregators.Meat shops have been exempt from the shutdown list by the Bengal government. While there is no shortage of chicken, mutton is nowhere to be seen because goats come from outside the state.The city gets the bulk of its meat from haats in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. Thousands of farmers flock to these markets to sell their goats. Trucks laden with goats arrive in the livestock markets of Calcutta three to four days a week. Retailers buy from there and sell mutton at their stores across the city.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on March 22 ordered a state lockdown in Calcutta and most of the rest of Bengal. A 21-day nation-wide lockdown, announced by the Prime Minister, took effect on March 24.The markets at Kanpur and Etawah in Uttar Pradesh and Patna and Saharsa in Bihar have been shut. The borders are sealed and hardly any truck with goats has come to the city after March 23, said wholesalers and retailers across Calcutta.“Before the lockdown, I used to supply around 250kg of mutton to restaurants and hotels across Calcutta. When the lockdown was announced, I was left with a week’s stock. I curtailed my retail supply so I could cater to restaurants. My stock ended before the end of March. I am sitting at home now,” said Reyaz Ahmed, a supplier in New Market.Zia-ur Rehman, a trader at the livestock market in Narkeldanga, said over 15-20 trucks, each with 300-400 goats, would reach Narkeldanga every day before the lockdown. No truck is coming now.Shiladitya Chaudhury, the owner of Oudh 1590, used to need more than 150kg of mutton for the five outlets of the chain. Three are open now but only for delivery. “The amount of mutton has come down to a little over 20kg,” he said.Shiraz Golden Restaurant in Mullickbazar, which is synonymous with mutton biryani for many Calcuttans, is delivering food via online aggregators. “We needed around 150kg of mutton every day. Now, we are lucky to get 10-12kg per day. We can make only a few plates of mutton biryani,” said Ishtiaque Ahmed, co-owner of the restaurant.",2020-06-04 23:58:00
753,Bhagyasri Chaudhury,Living with the enemy: When home becomes a hellhole - Telegraph India,"Home is where the heart is. But what if it is also the place where the devil resides?Anuradha Kapoor, director of Calcutta-based women’s rights organization Swayam, describes an already dire situation, which the lockdown is only making worse.No way to reach out“More than 8000 women are killed in their homes every year,” she says, explaining that the home isn’t a safe place for everyone.“Apart from phone calls, we are getting at least one case of domestic abuse everyday via email. But I don’t think the calls we are getting truly reflect the extent of domestic violence. A lot of the women don’t have access to phones, or are around their abusers 24/7, and they can’t make contact. We’ll get to know the true extent only after the lockdown is over, because right now, only those who can are reaching out.”One would think that people in urban families would have access to phones. But Kapoor says it’s easier said than done.“How will they make the call?” she says, “Then there is the question of recharging the phone, not everyone has an internet connection, and the lockdown makes going out physically impossible. Not every woman has a smartphone.”And many of those who do have phones that they can use, have no income at the moment. The phones are their lifelines for reaching out.“And if they are living with their abusers, these can be taken away too. So how can they be expected to get in touch?”Nowhere to runShelter has become a big problem, says Kapoor, because homes are not taking in people because of the coronavirus.Women being beaten up, or abused psychologically or sexually want to leave home, but have nowhere to go because of lack of transport.Domestic abuse, Kapoor says, is more to do with power than incitement. It’s not simply about an uncomfortable event, due to which people lose their cool and retaliate. It’s about patriarchal power in the hands of abusers. The trope of the drunk man beating his wife doesn’t play out everywhere. “People don’t beat up their friends or bosses when they get drunk. They will only beat up those they know cannot retaliate. It’s all about who you can take your frustration out on, a show of ‘I have power over you’.”Women, largely, cannot retaliate, and do not have a place to go. No one to hear youKapoor shares the story of a woman who was beaten up badly by her natal family. The police, when they were brought in, advised her to stay home now due to the lockdown, despite the violence.“This is the problem,” says Kapoor, “Domestic violence has been there forever, the virus isn’t creating it. And it does not matter that women are facing violence. It’s acceptable. Because the violence is ‘domestic’ in nature, it has long been condoned by the society. If I go out on the street and someone beats me up, there will be huge hungama. But if I am beaten up in the same way by people at home, then I am told to ‘sort it out’.”The conundrum is maddening.Shelters seem to be only one way out for such women. But most shelters are basic, and not all urban women can find living easy there. So what is the alternative? The state must create awareness and seriously address Domestic Violence.“The state government should advertise it like the Kerala government has done- ‘Don’t go from the lockdown to the lockup,” says Kapoor, “People need to know that domestic violence is a serious offence, and one could land up in jail.”Only providing helplines, she says, is not going to do the trick. Whether it is police intervention, emotional support or ration, access to support services is of primary importance.The problem? The ‘perfect’ familyWhether it is the family, the society, the police or the judiciary, everybody wants to make the family ‘work’. It doesn’t matter, says Kapoor, the kind of violence the woman faces. It is a cross for her to bear alone.“The whole idea is the family shouldn’t break up. And we must keep in mind that violence is not restricted to matrimonial families. Women are reporting violence from both the natal and matrimonial families,” says Kapoor,The solution? Long-term social change“Thousands of years of conditioning takes time to change” says Kapoor. “However, with the work of women’s organisations over decades, domestic violence has been recognised as a crime, civil laws have been formulated to address it. Today, more women are speaking out against violence. Earlier, only physical violence was considered as abuse. Now women recognise and speak out against all forms of abuse -emotional, sexual, economic, deprivation, neglect and physical. So the project of preventing family abuse is an ongoing battle.”Part of the change, Kapoor feels, is the need to change narratives.The notions of “men can beat you a little bit”, or “the more he hurts you the more he loves you”, are part of a mentality that will take a long time to overcome. So is discrimination between boy and girl children, and textbooks that insinuate that from history to mathematics- the heros are always the men.“Everything is telling women you’re not worth it, you’re not good enough,” says Kapoor, “So you have to change the textbooks, and the way you bring up your children. Boys aren’t born this way, they are brought up this way, they feel that abuse and showing power over another is the only way to show their manhood. We have to have an ongoing program from home, to school to society and constantly change these narratives, to change the understanding that women are unequal to men, and it’s okay to overpower or abuse women.”If you are facing domestic abuse, reach out to the National Commission for Women helplines here.",2020-06-05 13:46:00
754,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: One more Covid-19 hospital for Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Medical College and Hospital will start functioning as a designated Covid-19 hospital from Thursday. It will also treat people suffering from severe acute respiratory illness, chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted on Wednesday.Close to 200 beds will be reserved for Covid-19 patients and the rest for patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), a health department official said.“The hospital has advanced infrastructure as it is a medical college; so, it can treat critical patients,” the official said. “Patients admitted to the hospital with other illnesses will be shifted out gradually.” The health department official said  these patients would remain separated from Covid-19 and SARI patients. So, there will be no threat to them, he said.The symptoms of SARI are fever, persistent cough and difficulty in breathing, a doctor said.“Keeping in view the increasing need of ramping up specialised COVID treatment in the State, we have decided to notify Medical College, Kolkata as a full-fledged tertiary level COVID Hospital, which will start functioning from 7th May 2020 onwards,” she said in her tweet. “The facility at Medical College, Kolkata will start with 500 beds (for both COVID and SARI) which would be scaled up as per need, in phases. This will be the 68th dedicated COVID hospital of West Bengal.”The New Town campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), MR Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge, an annexe building of AMRI Salt Lake and the Beleghata ID Hospital were earlier designated as “state-level” hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients. MR Bangur has 1,100 beds, CNCI 192, Beleghata ID 82 and AMRI Salt Lake 51.Those who feel they have Covid-19 symptoms can visit the hospital’s emergency ward. “Doctors will examine them and decide whether to get them admitted to Calcutta Medical College or to refer them to other hospitals,” the official said.There is a need to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients because of the rise in the number of patients, the health department official said. “Beds in most of the Covid-19 hospitals in Calcutta are filled with patients. So, more beds are needed.”",2020-06-05 23:41:00

It would also ensure a “break from continuous screen time”.Some schools will also give students work to be done during the break. Modern High School for Girls and Indus Valley World School will break for about a month starting from May 16. “If we are allowed to resume school after the summer break we would do so, else we will continue with online classes,” said Devi Kar, the director of Modern High. Indus Valley will close a week later for Classes X and XII.La Martiniere for Girls and La Martiniere for Boys will also have a break but the dates have not been announced yet.Apeejay Schools will go on a break from May 22 to June 10. South Point has decided to take a break from May 11 to 16 and another one after a few weeks of online classes.“Students and teachers are not going out of town now.

761,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Howrah seeks private doctors’ help to tackle the spread of Covid-19 - Telegraph India,"The Howrah civic body has sought the services of private medical practitioners to tackle the spread of Covid-19.“The Howrah Municipal Corporation is reaching out to all private doctors who can volunteer and donate their services at our Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs). This is the best time to donate your professional services for the people of Howrah. We need your support. You may express your interest by dropping an email on commissioner.howrah@gmail.com,” the Howrah Municipal Corporation tweeted on Wednesday.Howrah is one of the worst-hit places in the state. It is the first district adjoining Calcutta where Section 144 of the CrPC was imposed following reports of multiple Covid-19 patients and lockdown violations.“The Covid-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented challenge before us. We feel if we are able to engage more doctors, we will be able to serve more people. Also, since many private clinics are closed, why not use the services of doctors?” Dhaval Jain, the Howrah Municipal Corporation commissioner, said.Barring some paediatric clinics, almost all private clinics are shut in the state.“Now that the testing scale has expanded; the number of positive cases will go up in the coming days. We are seeking the help of private practitioners to tackle the surge in numbers,” a health department official said.Four sample collection centres are being set up in as many ward health units of the Howrah Municipal Corporation. The units are in some of the worst-hit pockets in Howrah city.Eight wards — 6, 15, 19, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 36 (comprising pockets in Shibpur, Salkia and around the Howrah Maidan area) — are among the worst-hit, a Howrah civic official said.These places had reported a majority of the coronavirus positive cases in Howrah city, the official said.The shortage of government doctors has prompted the authorities in many states to seek the help of private doctors.The Maharashtra government has asked close to 25,000 private medical practitioners in Mumbai to report to hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. They have been directed to spend at least 15 days in the hospitals they are assigned to. A failure to comply may lead to revocation of their licence, the government has said in an order.",2020-06-05 23:59:00
762,Pinak Ghosh,Telecom: '72 hours' mean 'no idea' - Telegraph India,"Eighteen days and counting. That’s more than half a month.Cyclone Amphan struck on May 20 but thousands of Calcuttans are still waiting for telecom networks — wired and wireless — to stir back to life.Cable television, broadband and wireless services could take another 15 to 20 days to normalise in Calcutta, some of the telecom firms said on Saturday in response to questions from The Telegraph.Patients are missing medical consultations, students online classes and professionals assignments. But the call centre helplines drone politely that the connection will be restored in the “next 72 hours” and then little changes.The storm has bared how ill-equipped Indian essential service providers are. They are now saying — “off the record” — they do not have enough spares, they do not have enough money and they do not have enough feet on the ground.Added to that is lack of co-ordination. The army and  other agencies chopped trees and cables together after the cyclone. The trees were pushed towards the kerb side and the thoroughfares were cleared but that spelt a virtual blackout for lakhs of Calcutta homes.There is little hope of restoration until several kilometres of overhead cables are re-installed.That is what a “senior executive” said on the Airtel helpline to a Dover Lane resident earlier this week. The Airtel executive told the subscriber “30,000 broadband lines are still down in the city” and could not give a date when services would be restored.A Ballygunge resident complained that he had received several alerts about bills over the phone but not a single message from the telecom company on the delay or the reasons for the delay. “Why should we continue to pay if the services are not up to the mark?” he asked.Before the cyclone, the service providers were too keen to list before the media the precautions they were taking and how they were stocking up on essential supplies, equipment and spares.Now, officials, who overnight would not speak on record, blamed the absence of exactly those equipment and spares for the delay, among other reasons.The initial response of some of the operators in the early days after the cyclone was to join “live” cables and restore the service. But service engineers explained that where fibres were severely damaged, the patch-up would affect quality.As power supply was gradually restored, and subscribers switched on their television and routers, the problem became apparent.“Our broadband customers have been experiencing intermittent connectivity because of the deep damage to infrastructure. The services have reached almost near-normal and we are hopeful of full restoration shortly,” an Airtel official said without specifying any timeline and on the condition that he would not be named.“There was a shortage of cable as the market was closed because of the lockdown. Shops and godowns were closed and cable and equipment were inaccessible despite being in stock. This has caused the delay but the administration helped towards opening many of the stores so that equipment can be sourced,” said Chandranath Pyne of the Kolkata Welfare Association of Broadband and Cable TV Operators.Replacing cables has also emerged as a financial burden and several operators are looking to “manage costs”, which is hampering restoration of service.It is estimated that the overhead cable cost, including installation charges, is around Rs 20-22 per metre, depending on the quality of the cable. “These are our own expenses and we don’t get any support from banks and financial institutions,” said Pyne, adding that cash management had become a challenge post-cyclone.“We have never seen such damage. Thousands of trees have fallen, causing major fibre cuts. In some places, it is taking days to remove the trees. But work is going on round the clock,” added Pyne.Bijoy Agarwal, director of GTPL-KCBL, a cable service and broadband provider, said: “We are expecting that by the end of the month, services will come back to normal. But in districts, it will take longer.”According to a telecom industry observer, while all the network providers were affected, Jio, being a later entrant and having heavily invested in beefing up its network with diesel generators stationed at most network sites, remained relatively unscathed. “We have seen a rise in subscriber enquiries on new connections and portability,” a Jio official said.",2020-06-06 20:07:00
764,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus pandemic: Bengal aims for 15,000 Covid-19 tests a day - Telegraph India","The state health department has decided to increase the number of daily Covid-19 tests from around 9,500 now to 15,000 by the end of this month, officials said.Health department officials said there was a need for more tests because migrant workers had started returning in hordes from other states to different parts of Bengal.A number of steps are being taken to ramp up Bengal’s testing capacity.From next week, the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, which has been converted into a tertiary-level hospital to treat Covid-19 patients, will start conducting the RT-PCR test for the novel coronavirus.“A formal approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research for the RT-PCR test at the laboratory set up at the College Street hospital reached the state government earlier this week. The medical college will start collecting samples from next week,” a health department official said.Now, swab samples of patients admitted to the hospital are sent to the School of Tropical Medicine for tests.“Once the new laboratory starts functioning, the School of Tropical Medicine will be ready to accept samples from other places. The detection of coronavirus cases at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital will now be faster,” the health department official said.An RT-PCR machine was installed at SSKM Hospital three days back, taking the number of machines to detect the novel coronavirus in swab samples at the premier government referral hospital to three.The machine that has been installed at SSKM was lying defunct at ESI Hospital in Maniktala. The health department brought in technicians from Chennai to get it repaired.The hospital has been conducting over 1,000 tests every day, the highest followed by Niced Beleghata and the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri.The health department has bought six RT-PCR machines, which will be distributed to various testing centres by next week. “The medical colleges in Diamond Harbour, Rampurhat and Cooch Behar will get one machine each,” an official said.The health department has placed an order to buy a fully-automated testing machine from a US-based company that could carry out RNA extraction and test samples without any human intervention. Officials said the machine could perform over 3,000 tests every day.Covid hospitalThe College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital in Kamarhati will be turned into a Covid-19 hospital, officials said. Initially, 200 beds will be dedicated for Covid treatment. More beds will be added later.",2020-06-06 20:11:00
765,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Buffer or clean zone? Find out online - Telegraph India,"A list identifying all Covid “affected”, “clean” and “buffer” areas in the city has been uploaded for the first time, helping Calcuttans figure out the specific restrictions and relaxations applicable to them and others at a time the lockdown is being eased.The list of affected, clean and buffer areas can be found on wb.gov.in> district wise affected areas and buffer areas> know more> Kolkata.Similar lists for the districts are also posted on the website.Until now, only containment zones had been identified online. Now, the additional categories of “clean” and “buffer” are also specified.The Bengal government has divided a Red Zone (any district from where at least one Covid-19 case has been reported) into affected areas, buffer areas and clean areas.An area from where no Covid-19 case has been reported in 21 days is tagged clean, while one from where at least one case has been reported during this period is tagged affected.The immediate vicinity of an affected area is called buffer area if it is not clean.Relaxations of lockdown restrictions depend on whether a locality is in a clean, buffer or an affected area. No shop can be opened in an affected area/ containment zone and no one can enter or leave that area without a valid reason.On the other hand, a large number of activities are allowed in clean areas. In buffer areas, all activities that are allowed in a clean area are permitted, but with 25 per cent staff strength.Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the expanse of an affected area had been reduced for the benefit of people in the neighbourhood. As many offices have opened, the civic body and the police have jointly made a plan to ensure as few houses are sealed as possible.If someone living in a housing complex with multiple towers test positive, only the tower where the person lives will be considered a containment zone or affected area. People living in this tower will remain confined in their homes for 14 days. Those living in other towers of the complex can go out for work, said an official.The entire housing complex will be considered a buffer area.For a large standalone building, the entire building where a person tests positive will be classified as an affected area but not the lanes around it or adjacent buildings.In some cases, police and the CMC are considering only the flat or the floor as an affected area. Here the buffer area will include 10 buildings on all sides.For a small standalone building, the entire lane will be classified as an affected area if the building where someone tests positive is in a small lane.If the lane is quite long, five buildings on all sides will come under affected area. Ten buildings on all sides will be part of the buffer area.",2020-06-06 20:13:00
766,Subhankar Chowdhury,IIT tells teachers to refrain from policy criticism - Telegraph India,"The world may be grappling with the biggest crisis ever but IIT Kharagpur is more worried about some of its teachers “making adverse criticism of any current policy and action of the institute” in public.Registrar B.N. Singh on Friday issued a notice reminding the teachers that they were barred from saying or writing anything that can cause “embarrassment in the relation between the institute and the central government or any state government….”The notification states no employee shall, except with the previous sanction of “the competent authority”, participate in a radio broadcast or contribute any article or write any letter either anonymously or in his or her name or in the name of any other person to any newspaper or periodical.“Such articles must strictly be confined to purely scientific subjects and should not touch administrative matter and they shall be free from all political tinge,” the notice reads.It also says “no employee shall in any radio broadcast or in any document published anonymously in his own name or in the name of any other person or in any communication to the press or in public utterance, make any statement of fact or opinion which has the effect of any adverse criticism of any current policy or action of the institute”.No employee should make any statement of fact or opinion “which is capable of embarrassing the relations between the institute and the central government or any state government or any other institute or organisation or members of the public…”.The registrar told Metro: “This is part of an exercise to remind the employees from time to time what are the service rules as laid down in the acts. Many new faculties have joined recently. They may not be aware about the service rules.”The opening sentence of the notice says “it has been observed that many a times institute employees are offering their views/publishing information etc. in the print / social media”.Some of the reports, the notice says, have the effect of “adverse criticism of the policies or action of the institute or causing embarrassment in the relations between the institute and the central government”.Several senior IIT teachers said the order was aimed at stifling freedom of expression. On any campus of higher studies, teachers and students should have the liberty to exercise views without any fear. None was willing to be named for fear of “retributive action”.Activist Rahul Banerjee, who had received the distinguished alumnus award in last year’s IIT Kharagpur convocation, said: “Freedom of expression is the hallmark of any institution. The teachers and the students should have the right to express their views without any fear. There is an increasing trend to impose such restrictive orders to silence even the minuscule population that dares to speak on campuses.”Sabyasachi Sengupta, a former professor of electrical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, said: “If employees cannot say anything that has a political tinge, how could director V.K. Tewari deliver an address on the Facebook page of ABVP Bengal on the coronavirus outbreak.” The ABVP is the student wing of the RSS.Such restrictive orders are not confined to IIT Kharagpur.In early April, IIEST Shibpur had issued a notice asking students not to write anything on social media on contemporary issues tagging the name of the institute after some of them criticised the Prime Minister’s appeal to light lamps as a symbolic gesture against the Covid-19 pandemic.",2020-06-06 20:19:00
768,Sanjay Mandal,Camera detecting body temperature cuts queue at Calcutta airport - Telegraph India,"Domestic fliers arriving at the Calcutta airport now don’t have to stand in long queues to get their body temperature checked by hand-held devices or fill in a self-declaration form.Thermal and optical imaging cameras to detect body temperature have been installed near three gates in the arrival area and outside one entrance at the departure level of the airport, officials said.The camera is grabbing the image of a passenger passing in front of it and the body temperature and thermal image of that person is shown on the monitor placed along with the camera. The doctor sitting in front of the screen can see the thermal image and the body temperature reading of the passenger.If the image is white, it would mean the person has temperature above normal. He or she will be taken to a hospital for a Covid-19 test or advised quarantine.Airport officials said the cameras had been installed near gate numbers 3A, 3B and 1B in the arrival section and near gate number 3C in the departure section, airport officials said.One camera has been installed for international arrival passengers before the immigration clearance.The state government has installed the cameras and handed over to the airport authorities for maintenance.Now, 60 domestic flights are arriving in Calcutta every day on an average with 9,000-odd passengers. Airport officials said initially there were long queues of passengers who needed to fill in the self-declaration form and also get their body temperature checked with a hand-held device.It took about half an hour for a passenger to leave the airport after arrival because of the congestion. Airport officials said it was becoming difficult to ensure social distancing when so many passengers were queuing up.“We had requested the state government to install thermal cameras which would help ease the congestion. Now, the passengers can just collect luggage from the conveyor belt and walk out of the terminal,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.He said one camera was installed in the departure area as a pilot project to see whether it could be used at other gates. During departure, the passengers have to stand in queues to get their baggage sanitised, body temperature checked and then tickets and ID proof checked remotely through a camera.“We have to see whether installing a camera can actually help reduce queue at the entry gate to the departure area, said Bhattacharya.Similar cameras have been installed at other airports, including the ones in Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram, officials said.At the Calcutta airport, arrival passengers no longer have to fill in a self-declaration form. “The passengers are already filling in the form online. Airlines are issuing the form during ticket booking. So, we had requested the state government to do away with the system of filling in the form at the airport after arrival,” director Bhattacharya said.The new system kicked in on Monday.“Apart from taking time, multiple touches were involved when a passenger was filling up the form,” he said.",2020-06-06 20:53:00
769,Snehal Sengupta,Tree makeover for New Town after Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal - Telegraph India,"Palm, coconut, cherry blossom, pine and casuarina will be planted across New Town where more than 4,600 trees were damaged by Cyclone Amphan.The New Town authorities have decided to change the way it plants trees after the cyclone left a trail of twisted branches and uprooted trees.In order to have a clear idea on the type of trees that were the most susceptible to damage during storms, a recent survey was conducted by the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) across the township, including Eco Park.According to an NKDA official, during the survey they found that the mostly krishnachura, radhachura, kadam and simul trees were damaged or uprooted by the storm.The authority has decided to avoid planting these varieties on the median dividers and pavements.According to another official of NKDA, those trees that spread out in a large canopy will be avoided as they are susceptible during storms, if not pruned properly.NKDA chairman Debashis Sen said they would focus on planting trees that were  flexible and did not have a large canopy.“We will plant trees that have flexible trunks that can bend and not snap when hit by strong gusts of wind. We are looking for those varieties that absorb dust as well as all-season flowering trees. We have asked the forest department for help and will carry out a detailed survey of places where trees are being planted,” said Sen.Slender trees such as foxtail and rosy trumpet will be planted to weather storms while neem, kadamba, gokul, arjun, palash and ashoka to combat air pollution.According to Sen, they will hold training workshops for those who prune trees in New Town as several experts have pointed out that trees in urban areas are pruned unscientifically and untimely.According to a tree census that was carried out in 2018, there are 22,800 trees in New Town, of which most are radhachura, arjun and palash. Of the 4,600 damaged trees, the New Town authorities and the forest department have restored 3,738 trees using cranes, payloaders and ropes.A forest department official said the restored trees were being checked regularly.“We have propped the trees up using bamboo poles and are applying medicines to damaged branches or trunks. We are also packing the soil around the trees with fertilisers,” the official said.",2020-06-06 20:55:00

Unlike previous years, students had to sit in their homes and write their final semester papers.The results of the final semester exams will be declared on Monday, NUJS vice-chancellor N.K. Chakrabarti said on Saturday.Those with a backlog in previous semesters will have to clear them later.The decisions were taken at a meeting of the faculty council of the institution.The semesters in which the students will be given the provisional promotions had started in December. The semester-end examinations were to be held in April.Classes in all semesters were to continue till March end. But the institution had to be shut down as a precaution against the spread of the novel coronavirus a week before the completion of the classes.The pending classes were later held online.“Students will be given provisional promotion because the institution is still closed. We can’t reopen the campus immediately. So it is not possible to conduct the semester-end  exams. Students have been informed about the decision on provisional promotion through email today,” the VC said.The students could not be tested online because of several technical reasons, an official said.The university has also decided not to resume classes immediately and will take a decision on when to start offline classes in August. Nearly 95 per cent of the NUJS students are from other states and stay in hostels. There are students from states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, where the number of Covid-19 cases are very high.",2020-06-06 20:57:00
773,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Help for job-hit train hawkers - Telegraph India,"Forty persons with visual impairment, many of them out-of-work hawkers on local trains, got a few days’ dry ration from two NGOs on Saturday.People who depend on a day’s work for a day’s meal have been hit hard by the lockdown, which had come into force on March 25 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.Among such people, the differently abled have been hit the hardest, said social workers who organised the aid on Saturday.Pannalal Chakrabarty, 42, was one of the recipients. Chakrabarty, a resident of Durgapur in South 24-Parganas, was born with visual impairment and by the time he reached his teenage years, he was 100 per cent blind.Chakrabarty and his wife Kanaklata, also blind, sold incense sticks on local trains between Sealdah and Ballygunge. With suburban train services suspended for over two months, the couple are done with stretching their little savings to the last penny.“We used to earn Rs 150 to 200 every day. The savings we had is over. For the past two weeks, we have been living on help from NGOs,” said Chakrabarty.Each recipient got a 15kg kit that contained rice, dal, potato, oil, soybean and biscuits. A pair of masks were also provided to each recipient.“The stock should last a fortnight for a family of four,” said Chiranjit Gayen, a representative of Goonj, the NGO that provided the kits.The recipients were selected by The Society for the Welfare of the Blind, a non-profit that works for the uplift of people with visual impairment.“Many people who have lost their livelihood because of the lockdown are trying to make a living by switching professions. A mechanic is now selling vegetables. But blind people find it difficult to switch professions,” said Biswajit Ghosh, the secretary of the NGO. He is principal of the Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy in Narendrapur.The NGO gave Rs 300 to each of the recipients.The organisers went to several places in the city and its southern fringes — Baruipur, Garia, Tollygunge Phari, Ballygunge station, Kasba and Ultadanga — to distribute the kits on Saturday.Debasish Das, 48, was one of the recipients of Saturday’s aid. A resident of Kalyanpur, the station after Baruipur in the Sealdah-Diamond Harbour section, Das supplies phenyl bottles to stalls at Jadavpur and Ballygunge stations.“Some stores outside the station are open. But there is no way I can reach them without the train services,” said Das. “I worked hard for a living but there was a dignity in that life. Life dependent on charity is miserable,” he added.",2020-06-06 21:07:00
774,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Kolkata Municipal Corporation notice for full attendance - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has issued a notice asking all its employees to attend office from Monday.The notice issued on Saturday by the municipal commissioner said “all the departments” of CMC “are directed to ensure attendance of the entire staff strength”.Officials said the civic body’s revenue earning had been severely hit in the two months of the lockdown. More staff would mean the treasury offices could work in full strength and people could pay their taxes in these offices.The officials also added that with the monsoon approaching, cleaning of rainwater catchpits, last-minute road repairs, checking of drainage pumps and various other work that is part of pre-monsoon preparedness have to be completed at the earliest.Attendance of all engineers and officials would help meet the objective. “A full strength would mean we are prepared to deal with monsoon exigencies,” an official said.“Even if some of the pre-monsoon work cannot be done before it starts raining, there should be adequate strength to deal with situations arising during the monsoon.”Another official said the revenue earning of the CMC had been badly hit. Metro had on May 29 reported property tax collections had dipped by over 85 per cent for April-May, compared with the same period last year.An official said other revenue sources such as building plan approval, amusement and trade licence renewal have been hit, too. These are key revenue earners for the CMC and a full staff strength is needed to rev up revenue collection, the official said.",2020-06-06 21:08:00

776,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: St Xavier’s alumni aid for home repair - Telegraph India,"One hundred homes damaged by Cyclone Amphan in a South 24-Parganas pocket are being repaired by funds provided by former students of St Xavier’s College (Autonomous).The homes belong to students of the Raghabpur campus of the college, which started in 2014 and has around 500 students, who mostly come from marginalised rural families. Many of them are first generation college-goers.Some of the homes had their roofs flown away and some had giant trees crashing on them. Walls of some homes have collapsed.The campus had given shelter to many families on May 20 evening, when the storm was ravaging large swathes of South 24-Parganas.Volunteers of the St Xavier’s College (Calcutta) Alumni Association conducted a door-to-door survey in the surrounding areas after the storm to identify the affected houses. “We gave them money to buy stuff needed for repairs. More than Rs 8 lakh has been spent,” said a member of the former students’ association.“We believe that once a Xaverian is always a Xaverian. So, the former students consider it to be their responsibility to stand by their present counterparts, when the latter are in distress and dire need,” said Father Dominic Savio, the principal of the college.“The college has taken up a project called ‘Gift a Roof’ with the support from the alumni/ae. After the cyclone, an initial door to door survey of the students of the surrounding villages was conducted by professors and one hundred students were identified, whose homes were severely damaged. The response from our alumni/ae residing in different parts of the country as well as the world has been positive. The fund to rebuild their damaged houses are being transferred to the bank accounts of the students, recorded with the college,” he added.The college and its former students had provided drinking water to many families in the area in the immediate aftermath of the storm.“We feel proud and satisfied for being able to gift a roof to our next generation through this initiative,” said Sanjib Koner, honorary secretary of St Xavier’s College (Calcutta) Alumni Association.",2020-06-06 21:11:00
778,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Jadavpur University panel puts 18 trees back on feet - Telegraph India,"Jadavpur University, which lost one in 10 trees on its campus to Cylcone Amphan, has constituted a committee to try and save some from the uprooted 181.Giants like mahogany, banyan, peepal were ripped apart during the storm on May 20 and the felled trees had blocked concrete driveways across the campus.A committee comprising representatives of National Medicinal Plant Board (eastern region) and teachers has been constituted to work on possible ways to save the trees.The members of the panel were involved in a tree census on the 58-acre campus last year.“We want to minimise the losses as much as possible,” said registrar Snehananju Basu, the convener of the committee.A member of the committee said that so far they had straightened 18 trees with the help of a chain pulley.After putting the trees back on their feet, they are now working on giving fungicides to the roots to kill infection.“We have to work on hormone treatment of the roots so that they stay alive. The branches of some of the trees are required to be chopped off so that canopy weight remains proportionate to strength of the tree,” said the member.The team is also digging pits so that the roots have adequate space to grow deep.Another important aspect of the restoration drive would be to make arrangements for stacking for stable resting of the trees that have been straightened.Stacking is basically supporting trees with external props.“Stacking is required so that the restored tree does not get toppled whenever a strong wind blows,” said an official.On Friday, a group of tree cutters were working on to chop the trunk and logs of a banyan tree that still continued to block the concrete driveway that leads to Aurobindo Bhavan, the administrative headquarters.A visit to the campus would make it clear that the trees that stood along the pavement kerb lining the concrete driveway, which came up about a decade back, got uprooted in large numbers.“We are facing a steep challenge in saving those that got uprooted in the concrete driveway,” said a member of the committee.",2020-06-06 21:12:00
780,Manasi Shah,Wade: an ecological horror film on climate change: I have a nightmare - Telegraph India,"A blind girl sits on a raft made of discarded plastic bottles floating in depressing green waters. One end of the raft has a rope affixed. A woman who might be the girl’s mother — there is no way of knowing for sure as there is no dialogue or text on screen — pulls along the rope even as she braves the waters to move through a cityscape. The viewer will recognise the outline of Howrah Bridge, of Victoria Memorial, the stretch that is Park Street.The familiar markers in an unfamiliar and the most extraordinary state achieve the same effect as apocalypse films. According to Kalp Sanghvi, 26, who has made Wade with Upamanyu Bhattacharyya, 28, the 10-minute animation film belongs to the genre “climate change horror” or “ecological horror”.The storyline is simple: pushed by climate change, the rising sea has taken the city hostage. Human beings have been driven out of their habitat and so have the tigers. And when they come face to face, a tussle for survival breaks out.A quiet urgency imbues the animated characters. The man who leads the humans has a mask covering the back of his head; it is meant to trick the tigers into thinking they are being watched. The soundtrack enforces the doomsday effect. Bhattacharyya reasons, “We wanted it to be like a horror film where climate change is the ghost or villain.”According to Wade’s creators, the trigger for the film was a 2015 newspaper report on the sinking and shrinking Ghoramara islands of the Sunderbans and climate-change refugees. Says Bhattacharyya, “It shocked us to know that the islands were beginning to go under water because of climate change and not because of tidal activities. People were being displaced and rendered homeless. People being forced to move as a direct result of climate change is worrisome.” Sanghvi adds, “We thought it is already happening, Calcutta is next.”The film is at once a creative exercise and a red flag. The attention to flesh out the locale is deliberate; it is meant to enforce the urgency of the situation. “Park Street is such a happening part of the city. Imagine it being under water... The pink board of Flurys is a reminder of all the happy times,” says Sanghvi.Frames change. A pack of tigers appears out of the water taking the humans by surprise. The humans counter with knives and sharp-edged sticks. The leader of the man-pack is killed. An infant bawls and for fear that the noise will draw the attention of the tigers, it is drowned. The baby struggles a bit and then goes still. A tigress delivers a cub. A tiger is killed and the humans cut its limbs and eat the flesh.To work out the consequences of the imagined state of the city, the duo read books, surveyed the city on foot, photographed it extensively. The film was ready by November 2019 after a crowdfunding campaign wherein Bhattacharyya and Sanghvi achieved their target of Rs 4.5 lakh in under three days. For the next three months, they travelled with Wade all over the country for screenings at private venues for a select audience. In May 2020, it premiered at Germany’s Stuttgart Trickfilm International Animated Film Festival.Audiences, however, seem to have taken note of Wade only post the supercyclone Amphan that ravaged Bengal in May. It seems many sent in photographs of the post-Amphan scene and pointed out the similarities with the film.The visuals from Wade show how the bustling metropolis has been reduced to a silent swamp. Garbage all around. Crocodiles lurking on the main thoroughfares. Frogs in front of the Metro station. Crows cawing ominously, buildings overgrown with shrubbery, waterlogged streets, abandoned railway stations and deserted tram depots.Says Sanghvi, “People think they have enough time to figure out (climate change) just because it is not visibly affecting us. One does not realise that time is passing, climate change is creeping into our lives and soon we will have to face the consequences.”Would they reimagine the film if given a chance, post Covid-19 and the cyclone? The duo says, “We wouldn’t, because people haven’t changed much even after it.” In the film, a snake slithers past an electricity box plastered with torn posters that read, “Climate change is a lie, AC install.”Bhattacharyya calls both the virus and the supercyclone “tips of the iceberg”. He says, “It is inevitable. You may disagree about sea level and by how much it is expected to rise, but what cannot be contested is that people are going to lose their homes, their livelihoods and be forced to move.”He adds, “We know an animated short film cannot alter the way people think about climate change, but it is time to wake up.”",2020-06-09 01:46:00
781,Kinsuk Basu,Homemaker turns idol-maker after husband's Covid death - Telegraph India,"A homemaker who had seen her husband make Durga idols from a distance for many years has picked up the paintbrush after decades following his death.Piu Pal’s only motivation — to ensure their children can continue with their studies.She has even bagged orders from Durga Puja organisers who do not want large idols but want it something different this time. And the mother of two sons knows exactly what she has to deliver.Some of these organisers have been placing orders with her husband Arun Pal for years. She would watch them turn up at their Kalighat studio, explaining the themes to her husband and the kind of idols they were looking for.When Pal died of the coronavirus in July, she decided to step in. Their sons are still in school. Avirup is a Class XII student while Antarip is in Class VI. Continuing with their education meant Piu returning to something she had always held close to her heart: being an artist.“When some Durga Puja organisers came looking for my husband, I wasn’t sure what to tell them. I spoke to my sons and realised I had to take the call for them,” she said in between her meetings with puja organisers on Saturday afternoon. “It had never occurred to me that one day I would manage a team of 20 workers, giving shape to Durga idols. It was always Arun’s job. I used to watch from a distance.”On September 4, the family prayed for Pal, exactly two months after his death. In this period, she has received orders from at least 30 puja committees, including Ballygunge Cultural, Adi Ballygunge, Durgabari, Vivekananda Sporting Club and Behala Friends.On Saturday, Piu, in her early 40s, had held a few rounds of meetings with her team of workers and Pal’s studio had come alive with the familiar sight of Durga idols being made.Pal hailed from a family of artisans. His father Amar Nath and brothers still work on idols. A few years after their marriage in 2002, Pal moved out of the joint family and set up his studio in Kalighat’s Patuapara. Piu started assisting her husband, shuttling between Behala where they stayed in a rented accommodation and Kalighat.“Till 2016, I used to accompany him to various puja pandals to understand their themes. “From the pandals I would head home and he would return to the studio,” Piu said.“Now when my sons wait at home I try explaining that it’s for them.”This year, as organisers started pouring in, Piu realised the pandemic had forced everyone to cut down on budget. The allocation for idols has been drastically 
reduced.“People are saying they want smaller idols that would be easy on their budgets. Ora bolchhey kuri tey kuri (They said 20 in 20),” Piu said. “The challenge is to make Durga idols within Rs 20,000. It’s a near impossible task.”Every day Piu sits down with her team to work on various shapes according to the themes. Everything, from deciding on measurements to building structures using straw, mud and bamboo is discussed in detail before work begins for the day. Late in the evening, when Piu heads home to Behala for dinner with her sons, she knows what she has delivered for the day.“Piu has picked up Arunda’s style very fast. We have always been a Arun da loyalist and it feels great to see his wife build the idol for us this year,” Sandipan Banerjee of Behala Notun Dal puja committee said. “This year, it will be a mother’s tribute to the Goddess mother for us.”",2020-06-09 03:23:00
782,Subhankar Chowdhury,Caste-laced shocker in academia  - Telegraph India,"An associate professor of Jadavpur University who had said on Facebook that an academic year could not be more important than a student’s life was identified by her “Adivasi” background by a student and told in various ways that she was not qualified to comment on examinations.The student who made the comment is from Bethune College, the first women’s college in Asia established in 1879 and considered by many a beacon of liberal thought.The JU history department teacher told Metro that she wanted to be identified by her name, Maroona Murmu, while narrating how as many as 1,500 comments in support of the student flooded her comment box. “I was shocked. I have stopped checking my profile in the face of the barrage from trolls,” Murmu said on Saturday.So shocked was the head of a department at Bethune College that the teacher felt the need to apologise to the JU associate professor. But the head of the department, Sumita Mukhopadhyay, said that she too was trolled so severely for taking a stand that she had to delete the post.The student could not be contacted by this newspaper. The exchange between Murmu and the student took place on September 2, when most people in the country were debating the government’s decision to conduct exams despite Covid-19.Murmu, commenting on a post,  wrote on Facebook: “One year in this long life cannot be bigger than life itself, no exams this time.”The student, who is due to appear for her examinations from October 1, responded with her own comment: “Maroona Murmu, that’s what surprised me…. How could a professor of JU think like that…. I am astonished…. I don’t want to belittle you, but this is the difference between quota and unquota…. You don’t need to be a so-called professor to understand that life is more important than life’s one year…. … The problem is not about missing a year…. It is about progress because of caste and being disadvantaged for life despite having the ability….”She added: “Some people are getting their salaries sitting at home while some parents are having to step out everyday to provide us our meals.”After the rush of support for her, the student posted on September 3 morning: “This morning, just reminded one ‘Murmu’ Santhali in restrained language that she is an Adivasi…. But some uncles and aunts of her age reminded me that some so-called professors sitting at home have grown a thicker layer of fat.”After the student posted her comment, several social media users trolled the teacher. Murmu, who had studied in Presidency College and did her masters’, MPhil and PhD at JNU, said on Saturday night: “The student carries within her a social psyche that needs to be corrected.  She needs to introspect. It shocks me that the comment comes from a student of Bethune College. But what shocks me more is the fact that a group of persons rallied behind her and started trolling me. As many as 1,500 comments were posted in support of her. The fact that people think that this can be done by a student pains me. An organised force seems to be working behind the scenes.”Bethune teacher Mukhopadhyay was alerted about the posts by a relative.“Then I posted on my profile on September 3 that I am apologising to her (Murmu) on behalf of the student for the abusive comment involving the caste identity of the teacher. Moments later, people started trolling me for opposing her. I had to delete the post and explained to Maroona why I had to do this,” Mukhopadhyay told Metro.A statement signed by Partha Pratim Ray, the general secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers' Association, said: “The association unequivocally condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the vicious trolling and hate attacks being carried out on social media against one of its members, Professor Maroona Murmu, of the department of history.”",2020-06-09 04:31:00
783,Subhankar Chowdhury,IIT Kharagpur closed to ‘break Covid chain’ - Telegraph India,"The IIT Kharagpur campus will remain closed from September 6-13 or till further notice following an “increase in the number of Covid cases” on the campus.The rise prompted the authorities to introduce the closure for breaking “the chain of spread of Covid”.A notice signed by the institute’s registrar B.N. Singh on Saturday announced the closure.Following the imposition of the closure, no employee of the institute will be permitted to leave or enter the campus till further orders, except for an emergency.Those employees who are outside the campus have been advised to stay put.The entry and exit of employees who are permanent residents of the campus have been barred because the institute wants to break the chain of spread, an institute official said.The institute had on September 2, through another notification, advised the faculty, members of the staff and others to refrain from moving out of the campus/city.“Given a further spurt in cases in between, now a blanket ban has been imposed on entry and exit,” an official said.Many of the teachers and officials travel between Kharagpur and Calcutta to visit their parents or relatives. Many go beyond Kharagpur to buy things.But such movements will not be allowed now, he said.The OPD of the BC Roy Technology Hospital on the campus will remain closed except for the emergency unit till further notice.Retired teachers and officials of the institute stay in a society outside the campus and they keep visiting the hospital to for check-ups and medicines. “But this is being stopped now,” another official said.No members of the faculty or employees will be allowed to enter the academic campus area. No domestic help and gardener will be allowed to enter the campus. All offices of the institute will remain closed, according to the notice.The first positive case was recorded on the campus on August 19 and the number had shot up to 18 by September 4, a surge that prompted the institute to take steps to breaking the chain of spread, an official said.A professor said the delay in asking students to vacate the campus could be one of the reasons behind the spread.Close to 3,500 students stayed on the campus till June 20 when the first order on vacating the campus was issued.“These students did not leave… this meant an assembly, which was not desirable,” he said.Registrar Singh has sought the help and support of the faculty and members of the staff to make the “campus safe and secure from the Covid-19 pandemic”.",2020-06-09 04:38:00
784,Our Special Correspondent,Celebration of Father Roberge’s legacy today - Telegraph India,"A group of filmmakers will revisit the life and works of Father Gaston Roberge, considered a doyen of film studies in Calcutta, at a virtual assembly on Sunday.The Jesuit priest-turned-film academic died on August 26.

785,Our Bureau,Rail ministry ‘nod delay’ held back Metro plan - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government had told Metro officials more than a month ago to develop technology to control crowd, a senior government official said on Saturday.Metro officials had then apparently cited “the absence of a nod from the Railway Board” to take things forward.Had the carrier started working on crowd control earlier, a system would have been in place by now and services could have resumed from Tuesday, another government official said.“Over a month-and-a-half ago, Metro officials had told us they were willing to resume services if they got permission. We had told them to think about crowd control mechanisms and take the help of technology. But there was no permission from the rail ministry and they did not go ahead with the planning,” the official said.A Metro official confirmed that discussions had been held with the state government in late June for the resumption of services. “The government had offered to depute an agency to develop the technology to control crowd like it is doing now,” he said. “But the Centre did not allow the resumption of Metro services and the technology was not developed.”On June 29, the Union home ministry had issued guidelines that listed Metro among activities that would not be permitted. The guidelines were issued hours after chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said her government would speak to the railways for partial resumption of Metro services to ferry those involved in essential services.The Unlock 4 guidelines announced last Saturday allowed “graded” resumption of Metro services across the country from September 7. Metros in Delhi and Bangalore will resume commercial services from that day.But Calcutta Metro is still to formally announce a date for the resumption of services.The Delhi Metro chief had told Metro on Friday that their infrastructure and crowd control preparations had started long ago and the agency was ready to resume services on a two-day notice before the Centre issued the Unlock 3 guidelines.The lack of such advanced planning has stalled the resumption of Metro services in Calcutta.Even after the Unlock 4 guidelines were announced, Calcutta Metro officials said they could not do anything unless a nod came from the rail ministry, the sole nodal authority of the city’s transport lifeline.Five days after the Unlock 4 guidelines were issued, a meeting took place between state government officials and Metro representatives on Thursday. State home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay had presided over the meeting.Earlier, Metro officials had said only existing smart card holders would be allowed to access the services. Metro does not have the technology to keep a real-time check on smart card users entering a station.During the meeting, the state government is said to have asked Metro officials to develop a system for crowd control at the main entrance. “Metro officials said they did not have the technology, following which we offered to develop it,” a state government official said.The system will now be designed by a private developer which had earlier developed a transport app for the state government.The state government had in 2017 launched Pathadisha (pathfinder), an app that tracks state buses plying in Calcutta and neighbouring areas. Supported by the World Bank and developed by a private technology company, the app can help a person search a particular route and track an approaching bus.Friday’s meeting between Metro and state government officials was focused on software development for the new system. A QR code that needs to be scanned at the station gates is being billed as a solution. “The code will be generated much before the travel time. It will change colour every 12 hours,” an official said.But the developer has sought a database of smart card users to design the system. Metro has names of smart card users but not their phone numbers or other contact details. “A lot of hurdles have to be cleared before the system becomes operational,” another state government official said.",2020-06-09 05:13:00
786,Subhajoy Roy,CMC and IMA launch portal to seek doctor advice - Telegraph India,"People who are wary of visiting a clinic or hospital for fear of contracting the coronavirus can now consult doctors through a website.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Indian Medical Association jointly launched the site, kmc.janupchaar.com, on Saturday.It has a list of doctors who have volunteered to provide free consultation.A person has to register and create an account, for which an email id is needed. Once the account is created, the user can sign in and find out when a doctor is available. But the facility does not have any telephone number where people can book a doctor’s appointment.Santanu Sen, the state secretary of the Indian Medical Association, said there was no plan to introduce any phone number.“There are a lot of people who have some problems like a frozen shoulder but are afraid to visit a doctor’s clinic or hospital. This website will help them,” Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators, said during the launch.A similar initiative has been taken up by a group of doctors for residents of Salt Lake, New Town and Lake Town. These doctors have started a helpline (7439596460 and 7439598338) where residents who have fever but haven’t been able to get appointments with doctors can call for help and advice.The doctors, working under the umbrella, Protect the Warriors, will hear them out over phone and then WhatsApp them prescriptions.",2020-06-09 05:19:00
787,Debraj Mitra,Sunderban arrest lifts lid on deer meat racket - Telegraph India,"A man was arrested in a Sunderbans village in the early hours of Saturday with deer meat, a forest department official said.The 40-year-old man has confessed to being part of a racket that killed the deer after catching it using a snare in a forest a couple of days ago, the forest official said.The killing took place in the Ajmalmari forest, around 5km from the Kultali Block in South 24-Parganas.In April last year, the rotten carcass of a tiger was found in the same forest. An investigation had revealed it got caught in a similar snare — a trap to catch an animal by using a noose of wires and a bait — and died of starvation.The forest department got a tip-off about a group hunting animals and selling their meat. A raid last week had drawn a blank, the official said.A couple of days ago, a forest department official went to meet the group disguised as a buyer of meat.After being sure of their presence, a house in Baikanthapur village in the Kultali Block was raided early on Saturday.“One person was arrested. We found 13kg of deer meat with him. He is part of a larger group. We are interrogating him for more details,” the divisional forest officer of South 24-Parganas said.The operation was conducted with the help of cops from Maipith coastal police station, he said.Hunting and eating deer meat can lead to three years in jail, a wildlife official said.The killing has brought to the fore the menace of poachers of small animals in villages in the Sunderbans.After the tiger’s carcass was found last year, similar snares were seized from adjoining forests.People of the villages are involved in the racket of selling deer and wild boar meat, a forest department official said. Forest officials often face resistance in trying to arrest someone after a raid because of the involvement of villagers.Forest officials had been assaulted when they had gone to a village to arrest some of the suspects, a fortnight after the discovery of the tiger carcass.The group that had set up the snare comprised mostly villagers. More than 100 villagers had attacked the forest team.A few arrests had followed the assault.“We will arrest all those involved in the killing of the deer. I have spoken with senior police officers. There will be more raids in the coming days,” V.K. Yadav, the chief wildlife warden of Bengal, said.",2020-06-09 05:23:00
788,Sudeshna Banerjee,Covid: Hills tourism investors run into rough weather - Telegraph India,"Many aspiring entrepreneurs from the plains who had invested in hotels the hills in recent years mostly because of their love for the region are facing a tough call. Since the hotels have been taken on lease, many are finding it difficult to retain the properties and are being pushed out of the business because of the slump in leisure travel whose end seems nowhere near.Indranil Sen gave up his engineering job to feed his wanderlust. After a stint with a travel portal, he took up a homestay in Kalimpong. “It was taken on a five-year contract. But I was forced to let it go in the fourth year itself after income dropped to zero this summer. There is no chance of a turnaround soon,” said the Naihati man.He also runs a 16-room hotel in East Sikkim. “It is at a height of 7500ft.” Since the area is so remote, the hotels have to shop for supplies for the season in advance. “We shopped for March to May from Siliguri. In those initial weeks, Sikkim had no Covid-19 cases. But when lockdown was declared, bookings got cancelled and we had to throw away the fish and meat. The vegetables were given away to locals.”Lake Gardens resident Indranil Ganguly quit his city job in 2015 and leased a 24-room hotel, Tarayana Grand, in Gangtok in 2016 along with a partner. “It was doing well. But with income dropping to nil this summer, we had to let go of eight of our 12 workers. Four have been retained to maintain the property. We are paying them 60 per cent of the salary and a food allowance.”There have been no bookings for Puja holidays which are usually done by August. Even for Christmas holidays, there have not been any enquiries. Ganguly does not see any improvement till end-2021. “Sixty per cent small hoteliers, with eight to 15 rooms, have quit, I hear. They run the business on rolling capital, investing from their income. Such is the situation, they are looking to cut their losses on the working capital,” Ganguly said. He is unsure what he will do. “Our hotel owner has waived the lease amount for six months. But who will do so for two years?”Shibnath Ghosh, an electricity contractor, wanted to turn his passion into profession and took up a homestay in a Kalimpong village in December. “Soon train service halted because of the citizenship protests.  Just as things were returning to normal in February, the lockdown started.” He has also paid to build a property near Mirik. “This is such a blow at the very start in this business that I cannot even stand up.”Pulak Bhadra, vice-president of the Tour Operators’ Welfare Association of Bengal, points out that the pandemic might have crippled local tourism. ”Those who are forced to give up their leased properties now might not be in a position to acquire another hotel anytime soon. There is an initial investment of Rs 5-6 lakh to get a hotel ready. Where will this money come from?” he wonders.A big impediment to business reviving is transport. “There is just one train – a Covid Special -- now running between Sealdah and Alipurduar instead of 15-16 direct ones. But we cannot have tourism based on one train.” Localised lockdowns are another bother. “I sent one family to Darjeeling in June but the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration ordered a 120-day lockdown.” Another problem is resistance from local residents. “They fear that tourists from Calcutta will bring in the virus. A family was supposed to visit a homestay in Pakhiralay but the Gosaba panchayat issued a ban on outsiders.”Bhadra holds out hope for the newcomers. “Quite a few have joined the business in recent years out of love for nature. They might have their back to the wall now but I’d advise them to grit their teeth for six more months. Once trains restart, there would be 20 to 25 per cent business. And so many are fed up of being locked down that there will be no off season for us once the turnaround happens.”",2020-06-09 05:25:00
789,Our Special Correspondent,Eduguy launches online test on career choice - Telegraph India,"An online test that will help students determine their career preferences by assessing their interest and aptitude was launched on Saturday evening.Often, students are left “groping in the dark” about making the right career choice, those who conceptualised the test said at a programme attended by students, teachers and principals.The test will give the top-three career choices based on artificial intelligence and machine learning that has been conceptualised and developed by Eduguy, an online platform for career counselling that started earlier this year and IT company IBM.Eduguy is a group company of IIHM.“Sometimes children write all kinds of examinations and choose something where they have qualified without thinking whether it is suitable for them or not. We want to change that mindset,” Suborno Bose, founder and CEO of Eduguy, said.“If somebody’s skill is towards accounting, engineering, data science or cyber security we want to give them suggestions and not force it upon them,” Bose said.The Eduguy Career Predictive Test is a 120-minute test on aptitude, attitude, aspirations and psychometric parameters that will give a report explaining the three career predictions.Joining online was the managing director of IBM, India and South East Asia, Sandip Patel, who said it would give students the right direction.“I think all of us have gone through that predicament… what is the right career… this would be an invaluable tool that would enable all these kids at least to get some guidance,” Patel said.Anyone above Class VIII can take the test. Students can choose to take the test after Class XII as well.The test can be taken by professionals, too, who want to switch careers. “The test is equally relevant for professionals,” Bose said.Patel said: “Skills and renewal of skills, particularly post-Covid, is going to be very critical for everyone.”The test can be taken at www.ecptonline.com.After the test, if a student wants, he/she can speak to career counsellors or psychologists for 25 minutes. This option will be available after three months.",2020-06-09 05:28:00
790,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Dangling cable snip begins at last in parts of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Saturday snipped television and Internet cables in some places that were, at times, a risk to pedestrians and two-wheeler riders.Civic officials, however, could not say if the CMC would undertake a similar drive across the city in the coming days.Low-hanging cables along Rashbehari Avenue, Lansdowne Road, Gariahat Road South, Alipore Road, Belvedere Road, Baker Road and in the Hastings area were snipped on Saturday.The action came after Firhad Hakim, the chairperson of the CMC’s board of administrators, met multi-system operators (MSOs) twice in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan in the past two weeks, a civic engineer said.Earlier this month, MSOs had removed some defunct cables from along Harish Mukherjee Road and in Alipore after a meeting with Hakim.Many Calcuttans asked if such action in select pockets for a few days would eliminate the risk posed to pedestrians and vehicles or do away with the cluttered look.Metro has highlighted several times the risk posed by the innumerable cables tied around electric or lamp posts.Thousands of lamp posts and electric posts were uprooted in the cyclone and in the process several thousand metres of various cables came dangerously close to the ground.A resident of Garia, who rides a two-wheeler to his office in Esplanade, said such cables could get entangled with the wheels and result in an accident.In January 2018, a teenager riding a motorbike without a helmet died of head injuries when his two-wheeler got entangled in a heap of cables on the Park Circus bridge.Boby Banerjee, a resident of Garia, said electric and lamp posts in her neighbourhood acted as a junction for scores of cables. Whenever there is a storm, bundles of cable fall on the road and lie scattered, Banerjee said. “I have been hearing for the past three years that defunct cables would be removed. Does it take so much time to remove them?”In a meeting with MSOs on Friday, CMC officials asked them to pass cables through PVC pipes (8inch diameter) on a stretch in Alipore, a CMC official said.Earlier, there was a plan to have conduits under Harish Mukherjee Road and in a part of Alipore. “Underground conduits are costly… we are now focusing on PVC pipes because of budget constraints. The pipes will be tied to railings on footpaths,” the CMC official said.“If there are 50 TV and Internet cables along a road, we have found only 15 to be active,” the official said. “The biggest problem is that service providers do not remove damaged cables when they install fresh ones.”The civic body has held several meetings with MSOs and cable operators in the past year, asking them to remove defunct cables.",2020-06-13 21:34:00
792,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Coronavirus pandemic: Academic session on hold, says Partha Chatterjee - Telegraph India","It will not be possible to start the academic session now in colleges and universities, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Saturday.Chatterjee made the announcement after a meeting with vice-chancellors. “We will take stock of what other states are doing in this regard. We have taken note of what some states are doing… based on those inputs we will take the final call soon.”Some of the VCs suggested that the session starts from January next year, a higher education department official said. Some wanted the session to start from November after the Puja vacation, the official said.In Bengal, the academic session starts from mid-July after the publication of the Plus-II board results.A vice-chancellor present at the meeting said many VCs brought to the minister’s notice that the World Health Organization (WHO) had projected cases would peak in July. “We requested minister Chatterjee to take stock of the situation on the ground and defer the start of the academic session as far as possible,” the VC said.Given the “inadequate availability” of transport, a student will find it difficult to reach the campuses, another VC said. “We have seen how office commuters have to travel on buses disregarding distancing rules because of few transport options. If students are to travel like this, they will bring health hazard to campuses. It is better to start the session later.”Minister Chatterjee said the meeting focused on ways to maintain the safety of students, teachers, employees and members of the non-teaching staff.The government has already decided to keep schools shut in July, he said.In the meeting it was decided that assessments of final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students would be held without requiring them to visit campuses.A VC said he and the others suggested the model recommended by the University Grants Commission. “The UGC has said that arts and science students can be assessed by giving 50 per cent weightage to the best of the semester grade point average (SGPA) from previous semesters and the remaining to internal assessment,” he said.In engineering education, the mode of assessment has been left to Jadavpur University and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology. “They will follow what the All India Council for Engineering and Technology says,” another official said.",2020-06-13 21:36:00
793,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Long-distance buses to meet city demand - Telegraph India,"Several private operators who run long-distance buses have accepted a government offer to run their buses in Calcutta and adjoining areas with a “special permit” while choosing the routes.Most of these operators have been struggling to cope with losses as there has been no movement of buses to places like Siliguri, Asansol and Durgapur within Bengal and to Ranchi, Dhanbad and Puri in other states.Even after services resumed as part of Unlock 1, most passengers have avoided taking bus rides to far-off destinations from Calcutta. As a result, the losses have snowballed, according to operators.There are a little over half a dozen medium and big private operators with a fleet strength of close to 65 buses, which run on inter and intra-state routes.Some of the operators said they had incurred losses of more than Rs 50 lakh in the past two-and-a-half months in maintaining AC buses in garages and paying salaries to their employees.“The net take-home income is around Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 on a 40-seater AC bus for a round trip to Asansol from Calcutta,” an operator said. “The EMI on loans for these buses is very high and so aremaintenance charges.”On Friday, when the government offered to make special arrangements so that these operators could run their buses in Calcutta, it appeared to be a win-win situation for both. Operators saw an opportunity to cut down on losses while the transport department found an alternative to fill the demand-supply gap with the help of private buses.A deal was struck and it was decided that these operators would begin operations from Monday. Private operators running AC buses will have to follow the existing government fare structure for AC buses. “We have incurred losses of over Rs 60 lakh in this period,” Dhananjay Singh of Kaushik Global Logistics that runs Volvo buses on long-distance routes said. “We will run 20 buses on the Barasat-Dalhousie route.”Since June 1, when the government allowed operators to run buses with full seating capacity, private owners have been pressing for a hike in fares. The demand-supply gap came to the fore when government and private offices started functioning from June 8.On Friday, the government came up with the solution. It was decided that the South Bengal State Transport Corporation would run 200 buses and a set of private operators would bring in 200 AC buses. Among the eight companies that responded to the government offer, two used to run app-based bus services in Calcutta. These companies said they had stopped their app-based bookings since the start of the lockdow. “When the government came allowed us to choose the routes, we chose two routes for our services: Garia to Airport and Garia to Howrah,” Soubhik Biswas of Hexa said. “Our investment has been lying idle for months and this was a good alternative.”   Private bus operators who have been demanding for a fare hike said this temporary arrangement would not help fill the demand-supply gap because the passenger count was not enough to run buses throughout the day.“The passenger count has dropped by almost 60 per cent after the lockdown when compared to the pre-lockdown days,” Rahul Chatterjee of All Bengal Bus Minibus Samanay Samity said. “How can a bus operator sustain with the present fare structure?” Trams Tram services on the Tollygunge-Ballygunge route will resume on Sunday. Trams will operate between 7am and 8pm at an interval of 40 minutes. The passenger count will not exceed the seating capacity. No passenger will be allowed without a mask. A trial run was carried out on Saturday. It has been decided that coaches will be disinfected before and after every run.",2020-06-13 21:39:00
794,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Kolkata teacher braves cancer and Coronavirus - Telegraph India,"A schoolteacher was about to be operated for breast cancer when she was diagnosed with Covid-19.She recovered from the virus, underwent surgery for her cancer a month later and returned home smiling from hospital on Friday.A day later, her family spoke of her “steely determination”. Two diseases in a span of a few weeks left her weak but not battered, they said.She was not the only one down with Covid in her family. Her 73-year-old mother and brother, too, were infected with the virus. All three have recovered.“All of us had to be admitted to hospital and it was not easy,” her brother said. “When we had to be with her and together she was alone. She knew her treatment for cancer was getting delayed and then there was an added stress of recovering from Covid-19 and she could not share it with her family.”None of them had any symptom of the disease. The teacher was the first to be diagnosed with Covid-19 because of the mandatory test a couple of days before she was scheduled to undergo the surgery at Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre & Research Institute in Thakurpukur.In March, when the country had moved into shutdown mode because of the pandemic, she had felt a lump in her breast and tests and scans revealed cancer.On May 1, a day before her scheduled surgery, her Covid report came positive. A woman who was fine till a few days ago had a second disease in her body. They surgery had to be put on hold.The teacher and her family went to MR Bangur hospital. She was the first of the three to be discharged from there.“After she was diagnosed with Covid, we had to wait for her body to be completely rid of the virus. But all through she was very positive,” Arnab Gupta, director of the cancer hospital, said.“One should not get frightened if they have Covid but it is imperative to follow distancing rules and wear a mask to reduce the chances of infection,” Gupta said.",2020-06-13 21:43:00
796,Anasuya Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown disrupts special kids’ routine  - Telegraph India,"Natrajan Subramanian could not figure out why he couldn’t go to school. He kept grabbing his school satchel and made for the door. His mother Pushpa finally had to call his teacher and make her talk to Natrajan.Natrajan is a non-verbal autistic child. For many like him the lockdown has been a major disruption in routine. For children like him any disruption in routine is most distressful. Cooped at home, he was ready to tear his hair when his teacher asked Pushpa to create a school-like atmosphere for him at home. So Pushpa emptied out a room, put a desk and chair in it complete with a blackboard. Natrajan enters the room all dressed in school gear complete with his satchel and works on the worksheets and tasks WhatsApped by his teacher, Urna Bose, at Hanshi Khushi . With his mother’s assistance, Natrajan not only completes the worksheets but also helps his mother with household chores like changing pillow covers, watering the plants and generally pottering around the house. “I take him to the terrace in the evenings for a walk and some fresh air. This helps a lot too,” said Pushpa. It hasn’t been easy either for the child or the parents.The lockdown was so sudden that these children could not be prepared, said Bose, a special educator who co-founded Hanshi Khushi, a centre for persons with special needs.Much the same is happening with children at A Pleasurable Training Centre (APT), a school for mentally-challenged children. “We have about 65 children with autism, hearing impairment a majority with mental retardation. The main difficulty was to make them understand the lockdown. They missed school and their teachers, for the school was their second home and they shared a very special relationship with their teachers,” said Tapati Dutt of APT.It is this dependence on teachers that makes parents call them up whenever the going gets tough. Ratnadeep, a seven-year-old autistic child from Bansdroni, missed his two hours of football practice every day. “That was a way to spend his energy, and doctors had advised it as therapy for him,” said Ratnadeep’s mother Anima. During the lockdown, he had no option but to run around in his small apartment. Anima, too, tries to create a school out of her one-room apartment for her children. “I finish my household chores in the morning and from 9.30am both my sons are attending classes.” Ratnadeep’s elder brother, a regular child, attends his online classes in one corner and Ratnadeep does his homework in another. “Studying along with his brother makes him happy,” said his mother.But the irony is these children have got into a routine of being at home; so, when school reopens, it will mean yet another disruption.",2020-06-13 21:44:00
798,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Annoyed neighbour hurls kid to death from 4th floor in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A two-year-old child died and his six-year-old relative suffered critical injuries when a neighbour who used to feel disturbed by their playful mischief allegedly threw them off the fourth-floor balcony of a Burrabazar building on Sunday evening.Shivam Sau, 2, was playing with his uncle Vishal, 6, and four-year-old sister on the shared balcony of the building around 6pm when Shiv Kumar Gupta, 55, a real-estate broker who also runs a small transport business and lives on the same floor, lunged at them, according to the four-year-old whose name could not be ascertained.Gupta has been arrested and charged with murder, police said.The police’s preliminary inquiry has revealed that Gupta used to frequently complain to the Saus about the children knocking on his door and waking him from sleep.The police and neighbours said Gupta would also feel disturbed if a ball entered his room while the kids played on the balcony. The police said they did not yet know if any such thing had happened on Sunday.According to Shivam’s sister, Gupta first lifted Shivam, the youngest of the trio, and threw him off the balcony. He then allegedly grabbed Shivam’s sister but she managed to wriggle out and run away. But before she could alert her parents, Gupta allegedly got hold of Vishal and threw him down too, neighbour Rima Yadav quoted Shivam’s grandfather Budhan Sau as saying.Apart from Shivam’s sister appearing to have witnessed the alleged crime, the height of the balcony railings would make it unlikely for children so small to accidentally fall off.“I heard loud cries in the evening and rushed to the balcony fearing the building was collapsing. But then I heard Shivam’s mother cry out that her son had been thrown off the balcony. I spotted Vishal lying on the asbestos shade attached to my balcony. I realised that Shivam had fallen a few metres away, on the road,” said Rima, who lives on the first floor.Rima added that she did not witness the crime but heard about it from Shivam’s grandfather Budhan.Shivam’s father, Vikram Sau, drives a goods vehicle. The family hails from Begusarai in Bihar and has been living at 113 NS Road in Burrabazar for close to 10 years, neighbours said.The police said that a fortnight ago, Gupta had objected to the children knocking on his door while he slept.Budhan has two sons. Shivam and his sister are children of Budhan’s elder son Vikram. Vishal, the critically injured child, is Budhan’s younger son.Gupta has four sons, two of whom had travelled to the family’s ancestral home in Varanasi before the lockdown.“He (Gupta) has a granddaughter who is very small like the (Sau) children. It’s shocking how he could do this. His younger son had gone to the market to buy vegetables. When he returned, the police had already taken his father into custody,” a neighbour said.",2020-06-14 20:24:00
799,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Kolkata still to recover from the devastation of the cyclone - Telegraph India,"Half-broken street lights, inclined trees and collapsed billboards — tell-tale signs of the devastation caused by Cyclone Amphan — still lean on the city and the monsoon is likely to compound the threat they pose to commuters and others.The Telegraph spotted many such hazards across Calcutta.An overturned billboard has blocked the footpath in front of Apeejay House on Park Street. The sharp, rusted edges of the twisted frame protrude outside towards the road.Pedestrians are forced to walk down the carriageway to avoid getting hurt while trying to squeeze through small gaps on the footpath on that stretch.Broken and tattered billboards were spotted in the Gariahat and Girish Park areas and near The BSS School on Amir Ali Avenue. Architect Abin Chaudhuri said such billboards could collapse under the impact of rough winds accompanying rain during the monsoon.A tree whose roots were partially uprooted stand at a 45 degree angle in front of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. A lamp post stands dangerously inclined on BB Chatterjee Road in Kasba.Similar sights were spotted on the streets of Salt Lake, Baguiati and Kestopur.To make matters worse, several roads in Salt Lake — including Broadway, which connects the township with EM Bypass — plunge into darkness after dusk as most street lights have not been working since Amphan. Quite a few broke when the storm was blowing through the city.On Friday, a resident of HB Block in Salt Lake fell off his scooty after he suddenly slammed the brakes to avoid crashing into a broken lamp post near BD Block in the township.“The rusted end of the pole stuck out like a spear and was at the same level as my head. I spotted it at the last minute and my scooty skidded off the road, but thankfully I did not hit my head against the pole,” said Rishi Kundu.Residents said broken poles could be spotted in all three sectors of the township. A streetlight hangs precariously over the main road that connects EE Block to GD Block and broken signal poles lie on the roads near the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre on Broadway.On VIP Road, too, broken poles jut out on the carriageway on stretches along Dakshindari, Lake Town and Kaikhali.Krishna Chakraborty, the mayor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said she would look into the issue. “We are still facing an uphill task removing the trees. Nobody has complained about the poles yet but we will send our assessment teams,” said Chakraborty.A Calcutta Municipal Corporation official said they had removed most of the broken and inclined posts.“If there are any dangerously hanging electric poles, please lodge a complaint with us. There could be one or two instances of oversight. We have removed most of the dangerously inclined poles,” said the official.Naturalist Arjan Basu Roy said the CMC should quickly identify the trees that were partially uprooted and either try to restore them or cut them. “Such trees could topple during heavy rain,” he said.",2020-06-14 21:24:00
800,Kinsuk Basu,Test shed of untested patients dying with coronavirus symptoms to expedite rites - Telegraph India,"Patients with Covid-like symptoms dying in hospitals before they could be tested for the disease will no longer be subjected to the test post-death, the state health department has decided.Officials said the decision had been taken to cut the delay in disposal of the bodies of such patients, which is leading to piling of bodies at morgues.The death certificates of such patients will have the words “suspected Covid-19 patient” written on them and the bodies will be handed to relatives following the prescribed safety guidelines, the officials said.The bodies will be cremated at Dhapa or buried at a burial ground in Bagmari.The officials said the new rule applied to all hospitals, government and private. “We will need a day or two to work out the final order after routing it through the medico-legal cell,” a health department official said.The NRS Medical College and Hospital switched to the new system on Sunday.Till now, bodies of patients who showed symptoms similar to that of Covid-19 but could not be tested for the disease would be sent to mortuaries, where they would be kept before samples were collected for the coronavirus test.Results would usually take between five and six days to come and till then bodies would lie in a heap, sometimes without adequate refrigeration, sources said.“It usually takes three to four days or even longer for a test result to arrive. By doing away with this test, the waiting time for relatives will reduce,” said Santanu Sen, the chairman of the Rogi Kalyan Samity of NRS Medical College and Hospital.“The move will also help save Covid test kits. Since the body will be handed over in a leak-proof plastic bag, there is no fear of the spread of the virus.”The Centre’s guideline states: “The main driver of transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets. There is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling body”.Following allegations of bodies rotting at the NRS mortuary, senior doctors from the departments of medicine, microbiology and forensic science discussed the issue with officials of the health department on Saturday.“A mortuary has a fixed capacity,” said a doctor of the forensic medicine department at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. “If too many bodies come at a time, preserving them becomes a challenge.”On Saturday, health officials verbally conveyed to all medical colleges the decision to do away with the requirement of Covid tests after death.The bodies will be handed over in a plastic packet whose exterior will be decontaminated with 1 per cent hypochlorite.",2020-06-14 21:28:00

803,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya,Zambian student who studied in the city for five years talks about racism  - Telegraph India,"Not always, but at times you are hurt, and what hurts you is not called anything, because what is being done to you remains invisible. In another place it would be called old-world racism, but in Calcutta that word is not used much, as if it happens in Minneapolis, not here.One wonders how it affects a bright young person who comes to the city with a dream.Felicity Dindiwe was 20 when she came to Calcutta seven years ago from Lusaka, the Zambian capital, on a scholarship to study economics at Jadavpur University. She is an attractive young woman — she got a few modelling assignments in the city — and very precise. She seems to remember everything about her stay here with great clarity, including dates. “I came on July 8, 2013, and left on September 28, 2018,” says Felicity, now 27, speaking from Lusaka. She is now helping her father to manage his mining company, which deals in coal and amethysts, and is very busy.Zambia is not in lockdown because of Covid and the situation is not very bad.Did her five years in the city include bad experiences because of the colour of her skin?Not always, but sometimes, yes, she says. She does not speak with rancour. It is not easy to categorise experience in any case. But her very first interaction with the city was a shock. “The taxi driver charged Rs 1,000 from the airport to Jadavpur,” she says.“It’s not fair, is it, just because we are foreigners?” But that was discrimination at its mildest, cheating actually, and the city tends to fleece all foreigners equally, Black or White, even if it treats them differently. She would face other things.Felicity did not want to stay at the university hostel at first. Thus began the house-hunt. “It was hectic.” She was on a scholarship, on a shoe-string budget, and struggling under the pressure of her economics honours course. “I had a lot to catch up with,” she says. She had chosen to study here as she felt that Indian education had a higher standard than the Zambian.Landlords did not turn her down because she was African, she feels, “though others I knew were”. In the five years she lived in four south Calcutta apartments.At one of the flats she rented, the landlady did not mind her. But there would be trouble if her African friends, girls who were studying engineering in Durgapur, came over for the weekend.  “Then she would demand that they pay extra for the water and the electricity,” says Felicity. The landlady would feel that somehow the flat would suffer with the girls around. “But we were neat people. We weren’t messy!” says Felicity.It was as if a question always hung in the air about their moral character, irrespective of their behaviour, as it often does for people from the North-East. As long as Felicity brought no one in, it was fine. The moment that happened, it disturbed the equilibrium. “The landlady was trying to treat us like children.”  Other African students, men from Tanzania and Namibia, who had rented flats in the same house, left.“In fact we are never asked which country in Africa we are from,” says Felicity.At the end of her first three years, she decided to move into the university hostel after all. Where food was a bit of a problem, as her palate was not used to the spices of Bengali cooking. But that would not change. Felicity managed. She basically stayed in her room. “There was also the language barrier.”She remembers with gratitude the effort some of her teachers at the economics department made to help her with her studies. She is also in touch with her former classmates.Local markets could be terrible. “At the vegetable and meat shops, some would refuse to sell us their stuff,” says Felicity. And festive days could be humiliating: they could feel like true outsiders.“During the Durga Puja, my friends and I did not want to come back early in the evenings, as there was always a deadline. So we wanted to book a hotel for the night,” says Felicity. Most hotels told them that they would not accept Africans as guests, just as they do not accept couples who are not married.“But we were treated well in restaurants. And we used to often go to South City mall for its AC,” says Felicity. She got spotted at the mall for modelling. She featured in the ad campaigns of a few brands, including Super Dry (in picture). She also got film offers.The glamour world did not make her feel unwelcome at all. She attended events and went to parties, and enjoyed herself. The film roles she was offered did not make her feel uncomfortable in any way. Ironically, here she was not made to feel excessively sexual, which is another stereotype of the African woman.She felt more unsafe in the Metro. “My friend and I were in the Metro. A man touched her bottom. There were so many other women. Why did the man have to choose her?” she asks.But she speaks calmly, and never mentions the R-word herself in the context of Calcutta. About George Floyd’s death, though, she says that it was even more tragic because he belonged to the country, the US.And on the whole, India was amazing, she says. She would have even liked to stay on and work in Delhi. But she did not get a job that she had wanted.She wants to be an entrepreneur as well as hold a corporate job. And now she has to run, because there’s too much work!",2020-06-14 22:24:00

They were shocked to see the condition of the people. We distributed rice, daal, potatoes, onions, salt, mineral water, puffed rice, flattened rice, biscuits, milk powder, medicines, mosquito nets, mosquito repellent, lungis for men, clothes for women and bleaching powder…. We tried to help the people in whatever way we could,” said assistant headmaster Partha Basu, who headed the team.Another team will visit the villages again on Tuesday.This is the first time the school — set up 61 years ago and with around 1,550 students on its rolls — has taken such an initiative.Headmaster Soumen Pal said some students had approached him a week after Amphan had struck on May 20 and expressed concern about the condition of the thousands of people who were left homeless.“The students told me they wanted to arrange some relief for the people of the Sunderbans, the worst-hit place, and wanted to know whether the school could take an initiative,” Pal said.

806,Debraj Mitra,Partial solar eclipse on June 21  - Telegraph India,"Sky lovers in the city are expected to catch glimpses of a partial solar eclipse on June 21, provided clouds do not play spoilsport.An annular solar eclipse, which occurs when the disc of the moon covers the central portion of the sun leaving only a ring-like peripheral region called the “ring of fire” visible — will happen on June 21, Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academic) of MP Birla Planetarium, said.A similar annular solar eclipse had happened on December 26 last year. The eclipse was prominently visible from a stretch of southern India. Calcutta was tipped to see a partial eclipse but an overcast sky had hampered visibility.An annular eclipse takes place when the earth comes closer to the sun so that the sun looks little bigger than usual. Around the same time, the moon reaches near its farthest position in its orbit, thereby appearing a little smaller than the average full moon.In such a situation, if a solar eclipse occurs, the disc of the moon cannot completely cover the sun, resulting in a narrow band of light round the moon’s dark silhouette.“On June 21, the annular eclipse will start for people of Congo in Africa and slowly progress through South Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Indian Ocean, and Pakistan before entering India over the state of Rajasthan,” Duari said.“The path of annularity will then pass through Haryana and Uttarakhand before moving to Tibet, China and Taiwan before ending in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The longest duration of the eclipse will be seen near Joshimath in Uttarakhand. But from a much wider region around the path, people can observe partial solar eclipse of various magnitude and obscuration, depending on their geographical location.”The path of annularity covers places from where the ring of fire can be seen.“Calcutta will witness a partial eclipse, starting at 10.46am and ending at 2.17pm. The maximum eclipse will be visible at 12.35pm, when 65.5 per cent of the sun will be obscured,” Duari said.",2020-06-15 21:29:00
807,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Plastic peril in Sunderbans - Telegraph India,"Plastic left behind by relief workers in the Sunderbans in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan has left environmentalists worried about the fragile ecosystem of the deltaic region.Empty plastic bottles, packets and pouches of drinking water are lying around on the banks or floating in the river. Both government and non-government relief work exposed the Sunderbans and the mangroves to plastic.There has been an organised entry of plastic as government relief work included a lot of plastic water pouches, according to environmentalists.Water had been ferried in galvanised tanks to remote corners in the aftermath of Cyclone Aila. But it was not possible this time because embankments had breached and transport options were almost nil.People had no access to drinking water as many of the villages had been flooded, according to district officials working in the area.Water was ferried on boats in some places and plastic pouches were the only option. “We made brick tanks in the first five days of the water receding,” a South 24-Parganas district official said.While distributing water pouches, villagers should have been told not to dispose them of but to keep them, an environmentalist said. The return of plastic pouches can be incentivised by the administration.This can turn into a recurrent problem as more relief workers are reaching the Sunderbans. Awareness drives should be carried out so that villagers stop disposing of plastic indiscriminately, the environmentalist said.“We are aware of the problem and we are taking necessary action,” P. Ulganathan, district magistrate, South 24-Parganas, said.The public health engineering department will be asked to remove the plastic pouches, a district official said. Every gram panchayat has a solid waste management unit and members will be asked to “dispose of plastic responsibly”, the official said.A group of volunteers on Monday collected plastic waste from 14 villages in the Hingalganj block of the Sunderbans. The waste collected over Monday and Tuesday will be sent to the city for recycling.The group consisted of 50 people from Hingalganj and Calcutta, some of who have worked in providing close to 5,500 families with relief material in the past three weeks.Former students of Kanaknagar SD Institution in Sandelerbill gram panchayat led the group. “Some of our former students who live in the area realised that providing relief was not enough. There was a need to protect the biodiversity as well because plastic waste has been polluting both the land and the river,” Pulak Roy Chowdhury, headmaster of Kanaknagar SD Institution, said.Roy Chowdhury said it was not just relief workers but also villagers who were responsible for adding to the plastic waste menace. “When they saw teachers and others picking up plastic pouches, some of the villagers appeared embarrassed… they said they would be more careful. It is also a drive to raise awareness.”",2020-06-15 21:43:00
808,Kinsuk Basu,Suggestion to raze Kalighat bridge - Telegraph India,"The Kalighat bridge that connects Alipore and Kalighat over the Tolly’s Nullah has to be demolished, a government-appointed committee running a health check on bridges and flyovers has recommended.The reason: the structure has suffered irreparable damage.The committee, along with engineers of the urban development department, identified the 56-year-old bridge as the only one in south Calcutta that has to be replaced. Others can either be repaired or retrofitted with steel frames, according to the committee.Some of the reasons why the Kalighat bridge has to be replaced:The Kalighat bridge was among 15 bridges and flyovers — including Aurobin-do Setu, Sealdah flyover, Bankim Setu, Ultadanga bridge, Ambedkar bridge, Dhakuria bridge and Sukanta Setu — which the committee had identified for an immediate health audit within months of the collapse of the Majerhat bridge in September 2018.The government had set up the committee with six members, led by Amitabha Ghosal, a senior consultant on bridges and structures, to assess the condition of bridges and flyovers in the city.A load test was carried out on the Kalighat bridge in July last year. In January this year, a height bar was installed on either end to prevent movement of heavy vehicles on the bridge.The urban development department has, in principle, agreed to demolish the bridge and build a new one based on the committee’s recommendations.Tenders will be floated in July and the committee will lay down specific conditions for bidders to qualify for the Kalighat project, a department official said.Among various things, details of the last five projects executed by the bidding company and the time taken for completion will be taken into account, the official said.“The cost of building a new structure will be Rs 12-15 crore. It is better to invest in a new structure rather than incur huge expenses periodically in maintaining the existing structure.”The new bridge will be a steel girder structure. Most of the parts will be prefabricated. “We are looking at a two-year period to complete the construction of the bridge once a company is given the project,” the official said.Traffic diversions will be challenging but not impossible since police successfully handled it when the bridge was shut down for load tests in July 2019.",2020-06-15 21:52:00
810,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Vaccination hit as clinics around the city still closed - Telegraph India,"Immunisation and check-ups remain a worry because many doctors, including those who have started returning to outpatient departments of private hospitals, are yet to see patients in their standalone clinics, doctors and hospital officials said.Most standalone clinics are located in houses of doctors, many of who seem to think adequate safety measures against Covid-19 could not be taken at the clinics.Immunisation of children, which has been hit hard by the Covid-related lockdown, remains a worry for many parents in Calcutta.“We don’t want to take our child to hospital now because no one knows whether there is an asymptomatic coronavirus carrier. The risk is very much there despite the safety measures taken by the various hospital managements. The paediatrician of our child is insisting that we go to the hospital OPD because his private clinic is still closed,” said a 30-year-old mother, a resident of south Calcutta.A paediatrician who has opened his private clinic said he was getting calls for appointments from parents who usually go to other doctors.“In all the cases, the parents want to get their children vaccinated,” he said.The doctor said that to ensure social distancing he was asking some of the parents to go to private hospitals.“But they are reluctant to go to any hospital,” said the doctor.According to paediatricians, some of the essential vaccines are administered to newborns before they are discharged from hospital.“During a pandemic like Covid-19, vaccines for influenza, measles and pneumonia should ideally be administered. Also, there are some other vaccines like triple antigen and polio that should not wait. However, some other vaccines can be administered some time after the due date,” said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.He said the immunisation programme had been affected because of the lockdown and the fear of contracting the novel coronavirus.Not only immunisation, consultations and routine check-ups, too, are yet to return to normal as many doctors have not reopened their clinics.One such doctor, a ENT specialist, said he had started doing procedures at a private hospital from Monday but was not seeing patients at his two clinics in south Calcutta.Doctors who have resumed seeing patients at OPDs are scared of opening their private clinics. The doctors feel hospitals can provide more protection against Covid-19 than small standalone clinics.The chief executive officer of a private hospital said they were providing several layers of safety for doctors.While booking an appointment online, a patient is paying the fee so there is no queue at the cash counter. At most private hospitals, patients are undergoing thermal screening for body temperature and another test for oxygen saturation level in the blood, which is an indicator of the functioning of the lungs.“The OPD clinic is sanitised after every consultation. Those patients who are coming without a mask are being provided one,” the CEO said.He said it would be difficult to make all these arrangements at a standalone clinic.To take such measures, doctors will have to hire more people.“But the number of patients are still less because many are preferring video consultations over going to the clinic. So, the maximum effort and investment to ensure safety can bring only minimum revenue in standalone clinics. Viability is what doctors are looking at,” said an official of another private hospital.",2020-06-15 22:01:00
811,Snehal Sengupta,Mosquito fountains in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Several fountains in Salt Lake that have been lying defunct for months have turned into mosquito breeding sites following the recent spells of rain, leaving residents worried about a possible dengue outbreak.The Telegraph spotted several such fountains — five in front of Central Park, three on Broadway and two in AE and BE blocks — on Monday afternoon. None works anymore and all had stagnant pools of water at their base.Mosquitoes were buzzing around the structures in front of Central Park, the venue of the Book Fair for the past few years, and a snake was lying on a styrofoam plate in another. Water pouches and remnants of styrofoam plates were floating in the water, indicating no clean-up had been undertaken for a long time.The two fountains on the recently beautified green verge that cuts across AE and BE blocks also had accumulated rainwater in them.The three fountains on Broadway — on the median divider opposite gate No. 3 of the Salt Lake stadium — fared no better.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation is in charge of maintenance of all infrastructure inside parks, median dividers and public spaces in the township.An official in the civic health department said they had not yet started spraying larvicide in the three sectors of the township.“Our health teams are busy handling the Covid-19 crisis. We are regularly being sent on door-to-door visits and are also being asked to spray disinfectants. We don’t have the adequate manpower to spray larvicide as well,” said the official.Several residents said they were scared that the drastic rise in the mosquito count could lead to an outbreak of dengue.“The fountains worked for a couple of months. Following the rain, they are now mosquito breeding grounds. We are fearing a dengue outbreak. Repeated pleas to the civic body have fallen on deaf ears. No vector-control team has been sent,” said Avishek Chakraborty, a resident of AE Block.The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits the dengue virus, can breed in a spoonful of water. A pool at least six feet in diameter is like a sanctuary for them.An official of the civic body said the fountains had been turned off as there was “nobody to see them”.“The fountains were set up over the past few years as part of a beautification drive. Some of the fountains in front of Central Park were set up as decorative pieces before the Book Fair. Now, they are not being operated,” said the official.Mayor Krishna Chakraborty expressed surprise that the fountains had stopped working and promised action. “I will look into the matter immediately. We will clean up the fountains and spray larvicide,” she said.",2020-06-15 22:20:00
812,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: IIM students appeal for fee waiver - Telegraph India,"Students of IIM Calcutta have sought a fee waiver citing an economy that “looks very grim” and said they were uncertain about job prospects.In a letter addressed to director Anju Seth, the president of the institute’s student council, Hunar Gandhi, writes: “The situation of the economy looks very grim and the current and the graduating batches may be adversely affected in terms of future prospects. Many of the students avail (of) hefty student loans while others end up spending their savings from previous jobs for this course. While we are managing personal finances in these difficult times, we cannot afford to be paying the same fees for a different and a lesser experience than we signed up for….“We want the institute to make it good to us at this critical juncture in our lives. We hereby request you to provide relief in the tuition fee and other charges for various facilities that would not be availed (of) by the students.”Demands for fee waivers were so far limited to schools. The letter by the IIM student  council president underscores how deep the impact of the pandemic is on the economy.Asked whether it was possible for the institute to waive fees, director Seth first told The Telegraph: “I do not want to talk about the fee issue at this point. These are all issues that we have to think extremely carefully, including with the board of governors.”On Tuesday evening, she wrote a letter to the president of the student council.The letter, a copy of which she shared with Metro, says among other things: “We know your plans have been altered and you face unforeseen challenges. Your safety is our primary consideration, and we will do our very best to bring students to the IIMC campus at the earliest time with all possible precautions in place…. Given the complexity of the situation and the ever-changing scenario, our plans are necessarily still in flux. Please rest assured that all of us at IIM Calcutta are doing everything possible to facilitate your safe, timely, and successful completion of the MBA program and are devoted to continuing to sustain and grow the excellence of the program in every way possible…. We understand your anxieties and concerns, and hope to provide you with more specifics soon.”A student of the two-year MBA programme now pays Rs 22 lakh. The fee is payable over six terms.The amount may not seem much when compared with the salaries a large section of fresh graduates gets. “Now, the students are concerned about how they would repay their loan as the job prospects are grim,” said an official at the business school.Classes for the second year were supposed to start on June 6. But students have been home since March because of the lockdown.Gandhi’s letter says: “As we are past the time of the year when the various batches would usually begin classes, students are getting concerned, impatient, and a bit apprehensive. Student council members have been addressing many of the student queries, however an official update from (the) administration at this point would be much appreciated.”The batch that will graduate in 2021 — Gandhi belongs to this batch - has 480 students. Sources on the campus said around 90 per cent of them have taken a loan to fund their education.The fee includes the hostel charge. A student said if the authorities were unsure about whether students would be allowed to stay in the hostels because of the pandemic, they should waive the hostel charge. Another student said: “Besides, the authorities had fixed the cost of the programme factoring in that this is an on-campus programme. If that were not the case, the fee structure needs to be rationalised.”A teacher said the concerns stemmed from the fact that a recruiter had in April revoked six job offers to students of the 2020 batch. “Some recruiters have rescinded summer internship offers for the 2021 batch.”",2020-06-17 03:11:00
813,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Nudge to private hospitals to increase beds for coronavirus patients - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has appealed to all private hospitals to earmark at least 50 beds each for Covid-19 patients and asked more private diagnostic laboratories to start conducting the test for the disease.Some hospitals said they had already allotted more than 50 beds for patients with the coronavirus infection.Among others who have set aside fewer beds for the disease, some said it would be difficult to increase the bed count because of infrastructure and staff constraints.“…We are all aware that the number of Covid positive cases are on the stiff increase. At this stage we will need more beds to cope up with the demand. Apart from the infrastructure you are having, if you could offer a dedicated ward having a minimum number of 50 beds, we would try to arrange logistics, workforce and other resources,” retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, which regulates private hospitals, posted a voice message in a closed WhatsApp group of private hospitals of the state on Monday night. “I make it clear, this is simply a proposal.”In another voice message posted on the group the same night, Banerjee appealed to private pathological laboratories to apply for approval to conduct the Covid-19 test.“Several hospitals have contacted me and discussed the details about how to increase the number of beds,” Banerjee said on Tuesday.The number of Covid-19 cases has been steadily rising in the state. In the middle of May, around 100 cases were reported every day.On June 12, 476 cases were detected. The count was 389 on June 14, 407 on June 15 and 415 on June 16. On Tuesday, Calcutta had 170 new cases, raising the total count in the city to 3,946.Calcutta accounts for the maximum number of cases.Belle Vue Clinic and Medica Superspecialty Hospital have allotted more than 50 and 100 beds respectively for Covid-19 treatment.Several hospitals said it would be difficult for them to have more Covid beds.Woodlands Hospital said it had two beds where patients testing positive for Covid-19 were kept before they were transferred to another hospital.“Woodlands has infrastructure constraints and have 40 isolation beds with two Covid identified beds now. We are admitting all cases so that treatment for all other ailments and surgeries are safely carried out...,” said Rupali Basu, the MD and CEO of the hospital.Another private hospital, which has kept 20 beds for Covid-19 patients, said it could not add more beds in the ward.",2020-06-17 03:14:00
814,TT Bureau,Coronavirus pandemic: CNI airs fee compulsions; schools back - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India has said if its schools “are forced to reduce their fees further, it may lead to non-disbursement of salary and ultimately result in the closure” of the institutions.The CNI diocese flagged the issue in a letter to the chief minister on Monday.The letter emerged in the public domain on Tuesday evening, hours after the CNI allowed its schools to return to the association of heads of Anglo-Indian schools that had proposed certain concessions to ease the burden on parents.The three-page letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee was written by Reverend Paritosh Canning, the bishop of the CNI’s Calcutta Diocese. “If the schools that have already cut down heavily on expense heads related to school programmes are forced to reduce their fees further, it may lead to non-disbursement of salary and ultimately result in the closure of our schools, not only affecting the livelihood of the teachers and the non-teaching staff but also the future of thousands of children,” Bishop Canning has said.In another letter dated June 16, the bishop wrote to the honorary secretary of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools of India, Bengal branch, the nine schools that had quit the association last week after it proposed waiver of “certain fees” would return to its fold.The CNI referred to a letter that the Anglo-Indian school heads’ association had sent on June 12 requesting it to reconsider the decision of its schools to withdraw from the association.But no principal or member of the CNI’s Calcutta diocese “will associate themselves with the executive committee or any other committee of the association”, the bishop’s letter on Tuesday added.In the letter to the chief minister, the bishop said 10 of its schools were “unaided” and three received only dearness allowance for their staff from the government.All 13 have “complied with your (the chief minister’s) request… with regard to non-enhancement of school fees for the academic year 2020-2021”, he said.The CNI, the bishop said, has been paying “salary and wages to all our staff members as per the state government norms and most of the schools have already implemented the Sixth Pay Commission scales from January 2020”.Some schools “had intended” to raise salaries from April and had “budgeted for the increase” in school fees. The “tuition fee alone is no longer sufficient to meet the payment of salaries and wages to the staff”.The letter says most schools are “150 to 225 years old” and the upkeep of these buildings entails “huge expenses”. The schools have suffered “huge damages” because of Cyclone Amphan and require “urgent repairs and restoration”, according to the letter.The bishop has reminded the chief minister that “our teachers are regularly taking online classes since April” with “great sincerity and dedication” beyond their normal working hours.“We are minority Christian missionary institutions and therefore, principally we do not burden our parents with any unnecessary fees in order to make a profit,” Bishop Canning said in the letter to the chief minister.",2020-06-17 03:16:00
815,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Samples collected to ascertain spread of Covid-19 - Telegraph India,"Blood samples of 500 asymptomatic people in five Covid-19 containment zones in the city were collected on Tuesday as part of a nationwide survey to assess the spread of the disease, Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials said.The survey — “sero-surveillance to monitor the trend of SARS-CoV2 infection transmission in India” — was done under the supervision of the Indian Council of Medical Research.The samples were collected from people in Dhakuria’s Panchanantala, Chetla’s Pitambar Ghatak Lane, Hatibagan, Narkeldanga and Park Street-Royd Street area.The first phase of the survey was undertaken on June 11 and June 12 in the non-containment zones in 60 districts across the country. In the second phase, blood samples are being collected from asymptomatic individuals in containment zones in 10 most affected cities of the country. “Calcutta, which was part of the first phase, too, is among the worst-hit cities. This survey will provide evidence on the extent of the spread of the virus among asymptomatic people,” said a public health specialist, who is helping the CMC conduct the sero-surveillance.Asymptomatic suspects do not qualify to be tested according to the Covid-19 testing protocol. Only those with symptoms like fever, sore throat and runny nose can be tested.As a consequence, there could be a significant number of asymptomatic people who are carrying the virus without anyone being aware of it and hence, are not quarantined.“The survey will help the authorities gather an evidence base to formulate policies and strategies. It will also help us ascertain whether we need to focus on the asymptomatic population,” the public health specialist said.",2020-06-17 03:16:00
818,Debraj Mitra,Teen abducted and raped for three days in Basanti - Telegraph India,"A 15-year-old girl was allegedly abducted, confined and gang-raped for three days in Basanti, South 24-Parganas.The Class IX student was allegedly picked up on the night of May 27, when she had stepped outside her home to relieve herself. She was dumped near the backyard of her home early on May 31, her father has said.“During the period in between, the girl was allegedly confined in a home in a neighbouring village, where she was allegedly raped multiple times,” an officer of Basanti police station said on the basis of a complaint by the girl’s father.A medical examination has confirmed rape, an officer said.“I want them hanged,” the girl told Metro over the phone on Tuesday, a day after she was discharged from hospital.The girl’s father has named two persons as accused. One of them is a “resident of the area who had access to the complainant’s home”, the investigating officer said. The other accused is a relative of the first accused. Both are absconding, the officer said.The two have been charged under sections 363 and 365 of the Indian Penal Code (kidnapping and wrongful confinement) and Section 6 of the Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act.A brother of the first accused, who the cops said was also an accomplice, has been arrested. “My daughter was almost dead when we found her in the morning. I had given up hope that she would survive. But she did,” the father, who sells meat in the village, said over the phone.He also alleged repeated threats from the “associates of the accused” to withdraw the complaint.The girl was taken to Basanti Rural Hospital, from where she was referred to Canning Sub-divisional Hospital. She was discharged on Monday.The girl is being counselled by a local organisation that works with victims of sexual violence and trafficking survivors. “She is a very brave girl and is willing to fight to bring the tormentors to justice,” said Amina Laskar, a member of the group who was constantly by her side in the hospital.“The West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights and the South 24-Parganas District Legal Services Authority have been informed about the incident.”“The accused will be arrested soon,” said Rashid Munir Khan, the superintendent of police, Baruipur police district.Basanti, Canning and adjoining areas in South 24-Parganas are trafficking hotbeds. The lockdown and Amphan have made things worse, said rights activists.Several girls from theses areas were abducted and sexually assaulted before being forced into prostitution, they said.“The local police are extremely bogged down with enforcing the Covid-19 curbs and post-Amphan rehabilitation. They do not have the bandwidth to deal with trafficking and sexual assault cases now. The dedicated anti-trafficking units must be doubly pro-active in these times,” said Pompi Banerjee, psychologist and researcher at Sanjog, a network of organisations that works on justice for and rehabilitation of trafficking survivors..",2020-06-17 03:19:00
819,Kinsuk Basu, Coronavirus pandemic: KMC to place yellow bins for used masks and gloves in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will place yellow bins for people to throw their used masks, gloves and head covers, which can pose a health risk if improperly discarded.The bins will be regularly cleared by conservancy workers wearing protective gear and the contents will be treated as “biomedical waste”.“The yellow bins will be set up all over the city in phases. We will soon come up with advertisements asking citizens to drop their discarded masks, gloves and head covers only in these yellow bins,” Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the board of administrators of the CMC, told Metro. “To begin with, we will install 1,000 of them at different intersections and in crowded places by next week. Gradually, all places will be covered.”CMC officials said they had been receiving complaints from different pockets of Calcutta that people were disposing of their used masks and gloves indiscriminately, dropping them on roads and pavements and in markets.Over the past few days, conservancy workers have found thousands of used masks and gloves lying on or along roads and in markets across Calcutta, potentially exposing large sections of the population to the risk of contracting Covid-19.“Those who pick up such masks or gloves usually do not have any knowledge about the user’s health. If the items are picked up within a few hours or even a day of being disposed of, the chances of infection remain high,” said Amitabha Nandy, the director of the Calcutta-based Centre for Studies on Infection and Immunity.CMC officials said the number of such improperly discarded gloves and masks shot up several times after government and a number of private sector offices reopened on June 8.With hawkers returning to the streets and malls and restaurants reopening, footfall on pavements, markets and key intersections, too, has gone up.“Conservancy workers who have been handling normal waste are at the highest risk while disposing of these items,” Hakim said. “We will now enforce this habit of using yellow bins for dumping such items.”The CMC has decided that machines would first cut these waste into pieces, which will then be handed over to agencies engaged in handling bio-medical waste.A guideline issued by the ministry of health and family welfare states: “Used masks should be considered as potentially infected. Masks used by patients/caregivers/close contacts during home care should be disinfected using ordinary bleach solution (5%) or sodium hypochlorite solution (1%) and then disposed of either by burning or deep burial.”“Our conservancy workers will do the job with some training in handling such bio-medical waste,” said Atin Ghosh, a member of the board of administrators.",2020-06-17 03:20:00

He died of injuries on Tuesday morning, the police said.His brother who was riding the motorcycle escaped with minor injuries. Both were wearing helmets at the time of the accident, the police said.The app cab driver and the driver of the other vehicle, a four-wheeler, have been arrested on charges of causing death by negligence and rash and negligent driving.A traffic police officer said cops could not access any CCTV footage because the cameras installed on the spot were damaged by Cyclone Amphan that ravaged the city May 20.The cameras are still to be restored, the officer said.The driver of the other four-wheeler has apparently claimed he was not involved in the accident and that the vehicle had not touched the boy.He was already lying on the road when the vehicle was moving on the stretch, the driver has apparently told cops.All three vehicles — the motorcycle, the app cab and the other four-wheeler — will undergo a mechanical examination to ascertain the nature of collision between the three, the police said.“The motor collision report will help the police ascertain the exact nature of the collision.

Government officials could not explain that if hostels remained closed, how HS examinees in residential institutions would write the pending papers.“The clarifications are expected in the detailed guidelines,” said one official.The circular said though the schools were to be kept closed, the heads of the institutions could attend office. The administrative offices in the schools and emergency services like electricity, cleanliness, water supply, security, mid-day meal distribution may remain functional “under strict Covid-19 protocol and extant guidelines”.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier hinted that schools were “unlikely” to open even in July. “Studies of boys and girls are suffering, no doubt….

823,Snehal Sengupta,Subways with escalators at the Rabindra Tirtha crossing - Telegraph India,"Subways with escalators are being built at the Rabindra Tirtha crossing below the Kolkata Gate in New Town to help pedestrians safely cross the 59m-wide six-lane Major Arterial Road.The decision to build four subways at the crossing was taken following a proposal from the Bidhannagar commissionerate’s traffic department because of heavy traffic and pedestrian movement on the stretch.“Hundreds of men and women working in IT offices cross the road near the Kolkata Gate on their way to work or home,” a traffic police officer said.Pedestrians now cross the road dodging speeding vehicles while putting their lives at risk, the officer said.On Tuesday, many men and women were seen darting across the road as vehicles whizzed past them.The subways with four entry/exit points will open up in four directions in line with the giant pillars that support the Kolkata Gate.It is challenging for pedestrians to cross the Major Arterial Road that is 59m wide and has six lanes with a wide divider, the traffic police officer said.The road leads to Unitech, one of the busiest office areas in New Town, and the airport and it sees a large volume of traffic at all times — both on the airport-bound flank and the Salt Lake-bound flank, the officer said.“Although we have a signalling system in place and have deliberately kept the signal cycle long to help pedestrians cross the road, people often try to walk or run across the road while vehicles keep speeding past,” the officer said.The subways will be built at a depth of around 7m. The decision to install two-way escalators was taken based on feedback of residents and keeping in mind the difficulty elderly people and others with mobility problems face while climbing up or going down a flight of stairs, a Hidco official said.The township now has 10 subways, eight at the Akanksha crossing and one each near Nazrul Tirtha and in front of Gate No. 2 of Eco Park (the only one with an escalator but for climbing).“This is the first time that we are going to install two-way escalators in subways in the township,” Debashis Sen, the chairman-cum-managing director of Hidco, said on Sunday. “The decision has been taken following requests from elderly residents.”College students will be invited to spray colours on the walls of the subways and create graffiti, Sen said.An officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said police had proposed more subways in New Town, including one in front of City Centre.Hidco is planning to make space for temporary stalls that will sell magazines and coffee at the subway complex near the Akankha crossing.",2020-06-17 03:24:00

The special help desk for children will help “mitigate the harms that children experience”.“The Covid-19 pandemic has created a stressful situation for everyone and children have become the worst sufferer,” the commission has said. “Absence of normal activities, parents’ job loss, economic hardship or serious illness or death of close ones can leave children feeling traumatised.”The help desk consists of psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors who will be available free of cost to guide and support children to come out of such stressful situations and stay well, the commission has said.“The economic hardship is affecting children and they can feel the stress in the family. They are not getting things they would usually get because of this financial hardship… this stress is felt by children of all ages,” Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti, the chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said.The available psychologists are: Yashabanti Sreemany at 8777094835 (11am-1pm and 4pm-7pm) and Suvarna Sen at 9830434685 (11am-noon and 4pm-8pm). The available psychiatrists are: Rima Mukherjee at 8961573440 (5pm-8pm) and Arabinda Brahma at 9830066869 (6pm-10pm).The commission has circulated the helpline numbers in all districts and uploaded them on its website www.wbcpcr.org and on social media pages.Many parents are unable to give children time because of financial stress and uncertainty and children are unable to share their anxieties, psychologist Sreemany said.“Parents are worried whether they will be able to keep their jobs during the pandemic. There is tension in many families and hence the tolerance level of adults has gone down. The tension in the family and amongst parents gets reflected in the children and often they are unable to share it with anyone,” Sreemany said.“The helpline numbers will give them an easy access... adolescents are missing out on their freedom for a long time and are having to deal with the stress of online classes, which is not their usual routine.”",2020-06-17 03:24:00

828,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus lockdown: Suicide bid by Bengal TV serial scriptwriter - Telegraph India,"A 33-year-old man who has worked as a scriptwriter for Bengali television serials attempted suicide on Tuesday inside his restaurant that has been closed for the past three months, police said.The man had left home saying he had to buy some essential goods. Some of his friends alerted the police after reading his Facebook post that he was going to “quit” and they, along with cops, found him unconscious inside the restaurant.Cops and his friends said he was depressed because of financial crisis triggered by the lockdown and “some problems with a woman friend”.A disinfectant, an insecticide sprayer and a pair of scissors were found beside him, the police said. He regained consciousness in hospital.  It is not clear if he had taken the insecticide. “There were scars on his hand, which appear to be self-inflicted with the pair of scissors,” an officer of Regent Park police station said.“He was extremely upset because his family restaurant was not doing well. They had to close it down during the lockdown. He had some problems with his girlfriend as well,” one of his friends said.The friend, along with two others, had seen his Facebook post and alerted cops before reaching the restaurant.",2020-06-18 03:44:00
830,Snehal Sengupta,Mosquito fountains cleaned in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"The civic body appears to have woken up to the possibility of defunct fountains in Salt Lake turning into mosquito breeding sites and triggering a dengue outbreak.On Wednesday, water was drained out from some such fountains. In places where water could not be drained out, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s vector control teams sprayed larvicide and released guppy fish that feed on mosquito larvae.Metro had on Tuesday reported that several fountains — installed on the Central Park promenade in the run-up to the FIFA U-17 World Cup and the Calcutta Book Fair — had turned into breeding grounds for mosquitoes after the accumulation of rainwater.Krishna Chakraborty, the Salt Lake civic body mayor, said multiple teams comprising three members had been sent to the fountains.“A truck-mounted machine has been sent to drain out the water. Civic workers could not drain out water from a few fountains inside parks because the water would have flooded the area, the police said.“They sprayed larvicide in the accumulated water at the base of these fountains. We have released some guppy fish and will release some more as a natural way to counter mosquitoes,” Chakraborty said.The machine is used to desilt manholes and sewers. Powered by a pump, it can be used to drain out water as well, a civic official said.",2020-06-18 03:53:00
831,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Rain? Stand outside banks and suffer - Telegraph India,"Long queues are the new normal outside banks across the city.Enforcement of social distancing norms inside the branches requires entry of a small number of visitors at one go, said bank officials. The result — the rest of the visitors, many senior citizens among them, have to brave rain and the sun for a long time waiting in queues outside.Around 11.30am on Wednesday, the New Alipore branch of a public sector bank had over 20 people waiting on the pavement outside.The sun was almost directly overhead and the humidity level was high, too. “I have been standing for close to 30 minutes. All I need to do is update my passbook,” said Lakshmi Kanta Patra, 80.Five counters, including two cash counters, were operational inside the branch. “We have to follow social distancing norms. We are allowing five persons inside the branch at a time,” the manager said.At the Rashbehari Avenue branch of a PSU bank at Triangular Park, there were around 10 persons standing in the queue outside.“I waited for 40 minutes. But that is acceptable. What is not acceptable is my work being not done even after the wait,” said Beauty Sen, a resident of the area. She had gone to update a phone number linked to an account.At places like Rashbehari Avenue and Gariahat, several stalls on the pavement have re-opened following partial lifting of the lockdown curbs. The pedestrian movement has also gone up.Some people waiting in the queue looked unnerved every moment a pedestrian brushed past them, or came too close.“What is the point in maintaining social distance inside the branch if we are vulnerable in the queue outside,” said a 65-year-old man waiting outside a bank in Gariahat.The scene was similar outside another PSU bank on Anwar Shah Road on Tuesday afternoon. At least 15 people, some of them senior citizens, were standing amid a persistent drizzle.Some took shelter under the shade of a stall, keeping an eye on the queue to ensure they did not miss their turns.When the lockdown started, the customers waiting outside had to fend off only the heat. The monsoon arrived five days ago and over the next two months, rain and heat both are in store for such people.“It was a mad rush on the the first few days of April and May. We were allowing only a limited number of people. We had to take the help of police to ensure people standing outside maintained social distance,” said the manager of a PSU bank in Tollygunge.Across the city, circles were drawn at regular intervals outside the banks. Each visitor was supposed to stand inside a designated circle.“We started issuing tokens to pensioners to avoid the queue. The pensioners who were issued the first set of tokens were asked to come at the first hour. The next lot was asked to come an hour later and so on,” said the manager of a bank in Behala Sarsuna.",2020-06-18 03:54:00
833,Subhankar Chowdhury,Too early to think on fee waiver: IIM Joka director - Telegraph India,"A meeting at IIM Calcutta on Wednesday that was expected to discuss an appeal by students for a fee waiver did not take up the issue, officials of the institute said.The “emergency meeting” of the academic council of the business school decided that online classes could start on July 13, officials said.Campus sources said the institute’s board of governors would take up the issue of fee waiver when it would meet later this month.Students of the two-year MBA programme have sought the waiver citing an economy that “looks very grim” and said they were uncertain about job prospects.In a letter to director Anju Seth, the president of the institute’s student council, Hunar Gandhi, had said: “The... current and the graduating batches may be adversely affected in terms of future prospects. Many of the students avail (of) hefty student loans while others end up spending their savings from previous jobs for this course…. We hereby request you to provide relief in the tuition fee and other charges….”Seth said: “It is too early to be thinking about this issue. We are so busy trying to create this great experience for our students.... Things are different this year. Whether it is when they come in, whether it is how they come in.”Wednesday’s meeting could not decide on a formal start of the session as the bulk of the discussion revolved around the tech platforms to be used for online classes.“Complaints of glitches, poor connectivity are coming from executive programme, where online classes have started,” a teacher said.Seth, however, denied allegations of poor connectivity. Asked about resumption of classes, she said nothing definitive could be said now. “There are many committees involved. They are all coordinating. Everybody is working so hard. We have to think of Durga Puja, of placements, study abroad. All these are complicated issues.”",2020-06-18 03:55:00
834,Debraj Mitra,Rugby star feeds those affected by Covid-19 curbs - Telegraph India,"Over 100 people waited, in the middle of a persistent drizzle on Tuesday afternoon, near the Mohammedan Sporting Club tent on Red Road.Their eyes lit up around 2.50pm, on spotting a couple of cars and two-wheelers.A handful of youths, led by a man in an azure tee and shorts, got off the vehicles and got to work immediately.With an efficiency that comes with days’ of experience, they ensured that the people formed a disciplined queue before distributing food to them.The man in charge was Shailen Tudu, who, not so long ago, sported the India rugby shirt. The former player, now a fitness trainer, promotes the sport, especially among tribal children.For 85 days, his afternoons have meant feeding poor people around the Maidan. The number was 10 on Day 1 March 24. It has been over 300 for the past several days.“I realised more people would die of hunger than the virus. I started with only some people around the Maidan, my second home. The scale of the campaign kept growing. I have many friends who helped me sustain this for so long,” said Tudu, who went to the UK on a rugby scholarship in 2008.When Metro visited Red Road on a wet Tuesday afternoon, around 2.40pm, over 100 people were waiting.The people waiting included contractual labourers, sellers of nimbu paani, mutiyas (people who ferry loads on vans) — all hit hard by the Covid-19 curbs. Many of them, forced to vacate their old shelters, now spend the nights around New Market and Esplanade.“I have been coming here for lunch for over a month now. The help is a godsend,” said Kamal Mondal, an out-of-work labourer. The 40-year-old hails from Malda’s Chanchal and had been working in Calcutta for around seven years before the lockdown robbed him of his livelihood.He said he could not return home because he did not have money.The people waiting started waving at the cars.The plates were distributed first. A police vehicle also ferried some food to be distributed by Tudu and his friends.The days’ menu — a pound of bread and chholar dal for each, followed by rice, dal and a curry of seasonal vegetables.Serving with zeal was Tudu, who hails from Bankura and came to the city in 2000. His rain-soaked shirt did little to hide his ripped abs. Bucket and a steel ladle in hand, Tudu kept walking up and down the queue at a brisk pace.One of the friends was Anirban Kar, a lawyer at Calcutta High Court. “I was moved by Tudu’s efforts. I have a car and suggested we use it to serve more people,” said Kar, an Alipore resident.On Wednesday, several cartons of food were brought out from the boot of his car.“Our primary focus is the people living around the Maidan, because that is where my heart is,” said Tudu. The campaign has been feeding over 300 people over the past several days.The cooking takes place at the kitchen of a Bhowanipore eatery. The distribution starts from 1.30pm. The volunteers stop at multiple spots around the Maidan, the last one on Red Road.The best prize Tudu and his group have got so far — two Rs 500 notes from a Calcuttan.The group was on AJC Bose Road when a man on a cycle came up to them. Tudu thought he was hungry and gave him a plate. The man said he was not hungry.“I see you every day, feeding the poor. Please keep this small contribution from me,” Tudu quoted the man as saying before handing him the notes.",2020-06-18 03:55:00
835,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus lockdown: Oberoi unit seeks flight no-food rethink - Telegraph India,"The Oberoi group’s flight catering unit has written to the Centre, urging it to allow serving meals on flights and pointing out that it has not earned any revenue for three months.The Covid-19 safety guidelines issued by the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA), the regulatory body for airlines in India, state that food cannot be served to passengers on board.“Our factory has been closed since 20th March, 2020 and there is no revenue. Earning of several operating companies — especially those in hospitality, aviation and non-grocery retail — are badly hit due to business restriction in the country, triggered by the (Covid-19) pandemic. You are earnestly requested to kindly withdraw the restriction on in flight catering facility to the passengers in domestic airlines,” A. Imam Malik, unit head/head-corporate affairs, Oberoi Flight Services and Oberoi Airport Services, wrote in the email on June 15.The mail was sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, DGCA, ministry of civil aviation and the director of the Calcutta airport.“You are requested to initiate and pass necessary order to revoke the restriction and save our factory and livelihood of our workers,” the letter stated.It mentioned that the catering unit followed all food safety and handling policies.Taj Sats Air Catering Limited, the in-flight catering unit of the Taj group, is facing similar problems as its unit, too, is shut since March-end.According to sources, Oberoi Flight Services and Oberoi Airport Services in Calcutta employ about 200 direct and indirect employees. The Taj unit has about 350 personnel on its rolls.Sources in both units said they were paying salaries to all their employees.“Also, we have to pay utility bills like electricity and taxes,” said a source in the Oberoi flight catering unit.Domestic flight services from Calcutta resumed on May 28 after the lockdown restrictions were eased. Sources in both catering units said the airlines were not lifting any food items on board, abiding by DGCA guidelines.In June, the DGCA issued a fresh guideline which came into effect on June 3, which again said food could not be allowed on board a flight.“No meals or drinking water shall be served on board except in extreme circumstances arising due to health reasons,” the DGCA guideline says.A DGCA official said on Wednesday that serving meals on board would increase the risk of spreading Covid-19. “The guideline aims to minimise interaction between crew and passengers and to ensure safety for all,” said the DGCA official.“Passengers have to take off masks while consuming food and beverages, which will increase chances of the spread of the Covid-19 infection.”Sources in the Oberoi catering unit said the facility in Calcutta was set up in 2015 after spending about Rs 100 crore. At one point, the unit used to provide 4,000-5,000 meals every day to various airlines. Taj Sats used to serve around 6,000 meals every day.Now, they said a few airlines were getting food packed for their crew members but the volume was insignificant. “Most crew members are preferring to bring their food,” said a source.Airlines, too, said they were earning less revenue because of the ban on food consumption. “We earn revenue from serving food and beverages. But we have to abide by the DGCA guidelines,” said an official of a low-cost airline.An official of the Oberoi catering unit said they had contacted DGCA personnel. “They said they knew we were bleeding but they could do nothing,” the official said.",2020-06-18 04:10:00
837,Pradipta Tapadar/PTI,Galwan violence: Kolkata's Chinese community wary of 1962 rerun - Telegraph India,"Cheng Lee (67), a Chinese Indian, has been flipping television news channels at his home in the city since Tuesday trying to keep track of the Sino-India standoff in faraway Ladakh, in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed on June 15.He is not alone. The Chinese community in the city is one of the largest in the country and is apprehensive that the escalation of the conflict between the two Asian giants would hamper their lives and livelihood.Lee (name changed), like other seniors of his community, has a fervent prayer for peace on his lips. He does not want a rerun of the 1962 Indo-China war, when he had to leave the city that he calls home following a backlash against the Chinese community.""I was nine years old when the 1962 war took place. I vividly remember the day in October when some people pelted stones at our house and asked us to leave the country. A few days later, my father and uncle were detained by police. My mother took me and my younger brother away to Darjeeling, where we lived for a year,"" Lee told PTI on Thursday.""We do not want a rerun of that situation. We do not want to speak about it,"" said Lee, who represents the third generation of his family in the city. He runs a footwear shop that stands cheek by jowl with similar ones owned by members of the Chinese Indian community in central Kolkata.There are around 4,000 Chinese left in the city, down from 20,000 as most of them migrated to Hong Kong, Canada and Australia after the 1962 war.The community is apprehensive of even speaking about the escalation of tension between the two countries. Its members do not want to attract attention as they fear a backlash in view of the situation.The undercurrents of tension are already apparent. The Galwan Valley violence in eastern Ladakh has broken the brittle peace between the two neighbouring countries, spurring hashtags like ""BoycottChina"" and ""India'senemyChina"" on the social media and street protests.According to the president of the Chinese Indian Community, Kolkata, Been Ching Law, the community fears that the war-like situation between the two countries could lead to xenophobia against the Chinese Indian people.""We do not want a war, we want peace. The memories of the 1962 war are still fresh for the elders in the community, who were persecuted during that period. Apart from a few, most of us were born and brought up here. We are Indians, it is just that our surnames are Chinese,"" Law told PTI.He said the members of the Chinese Indian community participate in Durga Puja, Diwali and Holi. ""Our children hardly recognise their Chinese origin, neither can they speak Mandarin. They are more comfortable in Hindi and Bengali,"" Law said.The Chinese migration to the city began in 1780, when it was a bustling town in British India. With growing livelihood opportunities, the settlers preferred to stay back and made it their second home.""But the 1962 war changed everything. We were made to feel that this was not our country. We do not want to have that feeling once again.""For the last several decades we have earned the respect of the people here. We do not want to be treated with suspicion now,"" P Chung of the Indian Chinese Youth Association said.During the 1962 war, most of the members of the Chinese community were spared arrest but asked to report to the local police station regularly and stay within the limits of the China towns at Tangra and Territi Bazar in the city.The restrictions were relaxed only in the early 1980s and withdrawn entirely in the late 1990s.According to Law, the taboo of the 1962 war had a cascading effect on the Chinese Indian community. As job opportunities shrank, most of them diverted to restaurant, tannery and shoemaking business.The owner of a Chinese restaurant in the city feels that any worsening of Indo-China relations adversely affects business as people avoid the restaurants in the famed China Town at Tangra, considering the area to be a ""hub of anti-India activities"".""When the standoff at Doklam took place in 2017, the footfall at our restaurants dropped drastically,"" he said.Local Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and councillor of the Tangra China Town area Swapan Sammaddar said he has assured the community of safety and security.""When I visited China Town on Wednesday evening, most of the Chinese people there were scared due to the ongoing protests across the city. I told them not to worry and to remain calm,"" he said.",2020-06-18 19:22:00
838,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Pandemic: Bill nudge to private hospitals - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has asked private hospitals to conduct the Covid-19 test at the lowest possible rate, not to overcharge patients for personal protective equipment (PPE), display the number of Covid beds available daily and not refuse any patient.At a meeting on Thursday, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha asked officials of private hospitals to work out the modalities for conducting the test at a cheaper rate.Covid test rate“The charge for a Covid-19 test at most private hospitals and laboratories ranges between Rs 2,800 and Rs 4,500. This is in accordance with the maximum rate fixed by the Indian Council of Medical Research. I told the hospitals if someone is doing the test at Rs 2,800, others also can bring down the rates,” Sinha said.Now, swab collection for the Covid-19 test is allowed at outpatient departments. Which means patients need not get admitted for the test. The number of tests is increasing, too. On Thursday, 9,315 tests were performed across the state.Some private hospitals said it would be difficult for them to reduce the rate.“The hospitals and laboratories that have lowered the rate are doing tests in large numbers. We are testing on a smaller scale and so, it will not be viable for us to bring down the cost,” said an official of a private hospital, which is charging Rs 4,500 for each test.PPE chargeAt Thursday’s meeting, the chief secretary referred to allegations that a section of private hospitals was overcharging patients for PPE.“I told the private hospitals if there are 10 healthcare personnel at an operating theatre conducting surgery on a patient, they are charging that patient for the PPE cost of all 10 persons. That is causing a huge burden on patients,” Sinha said. “I suggested the hospitals consider how a portion of the cost can be borne by them,” he said.According to sources, some hospitals said the procurement price of PPE was high. Sinha reportedly told the hospitals to try and procure PPE from local manufacturers in Bengal, who fall under the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) category.“The consumable cost has gone up by 40 per cent for the hospital because of additional expenses of providing masks, gloves, hand sanitiser and PPE kits. The chief secretary has asked us to look into procuring PPE kits from small and medium scale manufacturers. If we can procure PPE at lower prices, we’ll definitely do it,” said Rupak Barua, Group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.Patient refusalPrivate and government hospitals will have to upload on the state health department’s portal the number of dedicated Covid beds available on a daily basis.The process will start on Friday, Sinha said.“This will help a patient who is going for admission to know where a bed is available. Gradually, we have plans to have a system of real-time update of the figure,” said Sinha. Also, every hospital will have to display the number of Covid beds available on a board in its compound.Sources said the meeting took up the issue of a particular hospital refusing to admit a doctor who had tested positive for Covid-19.“Under the clinical establishment act, private hospitals cannot refuse to treat a patient,” Sinha said.Satellite facilityThe state health department on Thursday said private hospitals were allowed to set up satellite facilities where patients testing positive for Covid-19 but are asymptomatic or having mild symptoms can be kept for observation.The hospitals can hire rooms on rent in its vicinity from a private enterprise. “Such a satellite facility will be designated as observation ward of the hospital,” the health department has stated.Patients staying there will undergo medical check-up every day. Hospitals can charge room rent and other charges like consultation fees and nursing charges, a health department official said.Such facilities will help lighten a hospital’s patient load and make more beds available for Covid patients with severe symptoms, he said.",2020-06-19 03:38:00
839,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Pandemic: No Covid-19 report required: ISC council - Telegraph India,"The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on Thursday said it had not given any instruction to schools to ask students to undergo the Covid test and produce a fitness certificate if they chose to write the pending ICSE and ISC papers.The clarification comes at a time several schools are asking parents to produce such documents.At least one school in central Calcutta has asked the parents of ISC and ISC examinees to get their children tested for Covid-19 and produce the reports by June 25.The school has allegedly ignored the parents’ submission that a child could as well contract the disease between June 25 and the date of the exams.Eight ISC and six ICSE papers were pending when the council suspended the exams in March to ensure the children do not get infected by the coronavirus at the test venues. The papers are scheduled from July 1 and 2, respectively.Another school in Calcutta has asked students to submit fitness certificates from doctors or give a self-declaration “to ensure safety of examinees”.Such instructions have, council sources said, scared off many children who had initially opted to write the remaining papers.The council recently announced that it would leave it to the students to decide whether they would write the remaining papers of ICSE and ISC or be assessed based on their performance in pre-board exams conducted by the schools.Thursday’s clarification was sent to the heads of all council-affiliated institutions.The council said it had only issued guidelines to schools about the safety measures they should take to conduct the remaining  examinations and asked the schools to “strictly adhere” to those guidelines.“It has been brought to the notice of the CISCE that some schools have given incorrect instructions to their students who are scheduled to appear for the ICSE/ISC forthcoming Examinations in July 2020.… The CISCE has not instructed schools to ask the parents of the candidates interested in appearing in the remaining ICSE/ISC Examinations in the month of July 2020 to get their wards tested for COVID-19, nor has the CISCE asked candidates to obtain fitness certificates from doctors or submit self-declaration forms,” council secretary and chief executive Gerry Arathoon said in a notice to the schools.The move taken by some schools to ask parents and students to get the Covid-19 tests done was “not in consonance with the safety measure and guideline issued by the CISCE”, the notice said.“You (schools) are also called upon to strictly adhere to the guidelines and safety measures issued by CISCE from time to time and not make any alterations to the same.”",2020-06-19 03:53:00
841,Subhajoy Roy,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 5,000 trees ‘healed’ in Kolkata - Telegraph India","Close to 5,000 trees that were partially uprooted by Cyclone Amphan in Calcutta have been restored, civic officials and members of NGOs who took part in the restoration, have said.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has restored trees on the footpath along Southern Avenue and Pratapaditya Road near Rashbehari, in Ekdalia, Naktala and Chetla, a CMC official said on Thursday.A group named Rebuild Bengal restored several trees in the Maidan area. At least 111 trees have been restored on the Rabindra Sarobar premises by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). Work is underway to save 40 trees on the Subhas Sarobar premises.The Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology in Shibpur straightened 27 trees on its campus. Former students of Jadavpur University have helped restore several trees on the campus.In New Town, the Hidco authorities and the forest department restored 3,738 trees of the 4,600 that had been damaged in cyclone. The restored trees are being checked regularly, a forest department official said.This is probably the first time there’s been a concerted effort to save partially uprooted trees, according to naturalists. The authorities seem to have felt that loss of green cover can have severe consequences, they said.Several trees get partially uprooted in storms in Calcutta every year. There has never been any collective effort to identify and restore such trees except for a few instances. “Every year, we see civic authorities busy chopping fallen trees. In fact, it is easier to restore trees when a few get partially uprooted… this time so many trees had fallen, but the authorities showed their intent to save as many as they could… it is a welcome sign,” a botanist said.Arjan Basu Roy, a naturalist who worked in the restoration of some of the trees, said not all uprooted trees were in a position to be restored. “A tree whose roots are severely damaged or a tree whose trunk has cracked near the ground cannot be restored. Besides, trees that did not get any water from above after its roots came off the soil cannot be restored.”Another naturalist said tree restoration meant putting back a grounded tree back to its feet after trimming its branches and treating its wounds.“A 20-year-old or a 30-year-old tree will grow a lot of leaves and branches in a short time. But if all uprooted trees are chopped and replaced with saplings, the green cover will take decades to be restored. This is why tree restoration is necessary to prevent the loss of green,” the naturalist said.The CMC has planned to plant trees, aged between three and 10, across the city to compensate for the loss of green cover because of the cyclone. Such trees will grow leaves faster than a sapling and some of the lost green cover can be recovered faster than a sapling, a civic official said.Restoring a tree on a footpath along a road, especially in an unplanned and congested city like Calcutta, is a challenge because of overhead wires, concrete walkways and hawker stalls. None of these can be damaged during restoration, the civic official said.In comparison, it is easier to restore trees inside parks with no human movement, especially now that parks are shut because of pandemic. In New Town’s Eco Park, close to 80 per cent of the 450 partially uprooted trees have been restored, a Hidco official said.There have been past instances of restoring partially uprooted trees inside parks but trying to save a tree on a footpath along a busy road is rare, if not unprecedented, another civic official said.The restoration of close to 5,000 trees this time could set an example and the city will benefit if it becomes a practice, the official said. “Calcutta’s footpaths are blocked by hawkers. Besides, there is no proper plan to maintain trees, which is why this initiative to restore partially uprooted trees can set off a practice of caring for trees,” the official said.",2020-06-19 04:14:00

843,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus pandemic: Safety training for street food vendors of Sector V in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Street food vendors and tea stall owners in Sector V are being trained to prevent the spread of the coronavirus while being given masks by the authorities.Of the 700 street food stalls in Sector V, many have resumed business as several offices in the state’s IT hub have reopened.Officegoers flock to such stalls that can be found on almost every footpath in Sector V during lunch hours while tea stalls that sell cigarettes and other items are popular with employees during short breaks.The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA), which provides the IT hub with civic services, has estimated that apart from the 700 street food stalls, some 300-odd stalls sell tea, cigarettes and other items.Owners of these stalls and their helps are being trained in batches about things they need to do to prevent the spread of the virus. Hawkers are being asked to ensure they wash the seating areas and tables with soap and water before starting business for the day.Water tankers are spraying a mixture of sodium hypochlorite solution and water every morning on the bamboo and plastic structures, an NDITA official said.At the end of the training, stall owners and their helps are being given “Covid-19 kits”, which contain masks, bottles of liquid soaps and leaflets on safe practices in English and Bengali, the NDITA official said.Sukanta Mukherjee, who works in Sector V, said he was surprised when the owner of his regular tea stall showed him a liquid soap dispenser and a mug of water and asked him to wash his hands before taking his cup of tea.“Das da (the owner) was wearing a mask… he asked me to wash my hands…. I was taken aback… I was carrying a hand sanitiser and I cleaned my hands with it,” Mukherjee said. “It was only then that he gave me a cup of tea. It felt good to see hawkers following precautions.”The largest concentration of such stalls in Sector V is in the EP and GP blocks near the RD Boulevard.The stalls on footpaths lining the streets of Sector V have designated seating areas with benches and plastic chairs.Stall owners are asked to ensure there’s adequate space between chairs and they or their helps wear masks and hand gloves, Debashis Sen, the chairman of NDITA, said.“This is largely an unorganised sector that caters to one of the most important needs of officegoers in Sector V. We started holding workshops for stall owners keeping in mind everyone’s safety,” Sen said. “We are ensuring compliance by sending teams to check if distancing rules are being followed.”He said hawkers have been asked to use disposable plates and cutlery. At least 300 hawkers have been trained in batches of 20 and the response has been satisfactory, he said.“We had asked the hawkers to form batches and they have done that. Often, we conduct surprise checks… we have found that most are following what we have told them to do,” Sen said.Devi Rani Ghosh, the owner of a tea and cigarette shop near the Webel crossing, said she made sure to follow distancing rules and keep jars of water and soap for customers.“We are requesting customers to wash their hands and wear masks. Most are listening to us,” Ghosh said.Stalls selling cigarettes and tea have been encouraged to set up plastic barriers as part of the distancing protocol, an NDITA official said.",2020-06-19 04:19:00
845,Monalisa Chaudhuri,"Coronavirus pandemic: House sealed, Covid-19 patient waits outside - Telegraph India","Police have started sealing apartments and standalone houses with guardrails, tapes or ropes if a resident tests positive for Covid-19.A Calcuttan who tested positive for the disease was discharged from hospital on condition that she would quarantine herself at home. On her return home, near Tollygunge, she found the collapsible gate of the apartment bound by a thick rope, though her mother was inside.Wearing personal protective equipment, she had to wait for 55 minutes at the staircase as no cop was around to break the seal. She could only step in after her 75-year-old mother managed to loosen the knot on the rope and make way for her to slip through.“Before returning home, I had gone to the local police station in an ambulance. I was waiting in the vehicle, while a friend, who was in her car, went inside the police station to complete all formalities. Still, my flat was sealed when I returned home and no cop was around,” the woman recounted.Her elderly mother tried to contact an officer of the police station, who was coordinating Covid-related issues in the area, but he apparently did not take her calls.“I was feeling very weak and was not in a position to stand. So, I sat on the staircase waiting for someone from the police station to come and unseal my home. My mother was standing inside helplessly. When she contacted the local police station’s landline and informed them about my return, they said they had no prior information. I was surprised because I had gone to the police station on my way home,” she told Metro.A constable turned up after a while and left after seeing that the patient had entered home.A senior officer of the police station said: “This is unfortunate. Under no circumstances the patient should have been kept waiting.”Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma told Metro on Thursday night: “I have instructed the local police to keep in touch with residents and respond to their needs.”A government circular issued on June 1 states that  a flat is considered a “containment area” if even one resident tests positive. If residents in more than one flat test positive, the entire building is considered a containment area.If people in multiple towers in a housing complex test positive, the entire compound becomes a containment area.“In case of standalone homes, a house is sealed if a resident tests positive. And if residents of multiple houses test positive, the area will be sealed with a perimeter restriction,” a health department official said.An officer of a police station — not the one that guards the area where the harassed woman lives — said they had been instructed by Lalbazar to help people in containment areas in all possible ways.",2020-06-19 04:23:00
846,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus pandemic: Parents’ dilemma: to let child write papers or not - Telegraph India,"Parents have a “tough call” to make as many ICSE/ISC examinees want to write the pending papers because of unsatisfactory performance in the pre-board exams, but doing so might expose them to the risk of contracting the coronavirus.“If they go to school to write the pending papers, it will be difficult to keep them apart once the test is over,” a parent said.The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has allowed its students to decide whether they would write the remaining papers of their ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) exams or be assessed through “internal assessment/pre-board examinations conducted by their own school”.Eight ISC papers and six ICSE papers were pending when the council suspended the two exams in March to protect the children from being infected by the novel coronavirus in school.Parents said some students had decided to be judged by their performance in the pre-board exams but they were having second thoughts after coming under the influence of those who had decided to write the papers.“The parents now have to take a call and that is leading to additional stress on them,” the principal of an ISC school said. Some parents have been calling up teachers and school heads to ask what they should do.“My daughter wants to write the papers because she does not want to miss the opportunity to better her score. But as a parent I am jittery about her safety when she will step out of the house,” said Tejas Doshi, whose daughter has four ICSE papers left.Parents realise that schools tend to give “conservative marks” in internal exams so the students feel the urge to study harder for the board exams. Also, many students are not as well prepared for the internal exams as they are for the board exams.“Schools usually give more conservative marks in the pre-boards. My daughter is apprehensive that she might miss out on a subject of her choice if she doesn’t score well in that subject,” said Manish Dalmia, whose daughter is appearing for ICSE.“It is a tough call for us because as parents we know that when children meet their friends after a gap of three months, they will hug them. Physical distancing cannot be enforced is such a setting,” he said.On Wednesday, the council had written to the heads of all schools that some examinees were being “coerced into making a choice, much against their wishes…. We hereby further clarify that the schools are requested not to impose and/or influence the choices of the candidates.”The council has once again clarified that the examinees and/or their parents are free to make a choice.Some parents are worried about their parents. “My mother is 70-plus. If my son goes out, my mother will be at risk, too.... My son is an ISC examinee and his marksheet will play a crucial role in his career decisions,” said Vivek Bhimsaria.Some of the parents’ concerns are:“It is an additional stress on parents because they are confused about which choice is best for the child. They don’t know how they (the children) have done in the rest of the papers and also that usually children do better in the board exams, so they are contemplating despite safety being the first concern for most parents,” said Devi Kar, the director of Modern High School for Girls.ISC students are worried because their grades will decide which college will take them in.“I have applied in the UK and got conditional admission, which will be made unconditional after I get my ISC marksheet. I do not want to jeopardise my chances of studying in the UK,” said Nathan Gasper Chowdhury, an ISC examinee from La Martiniere for Boys.“Many of the ISC examiners have said they want to appear for the exam because they fear that they will otherwise jeopardise their college admissions and they don’t want to take that chance since they have been given a choice,” said John Bagul, the principal of South City International School.",2020-06-19 04:25:00
847,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Calcutta police to use binoculars to keep tabs on kites - Telegraph India,"Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma told his officers on Thursday to use binoculars from highrises near flyovers to locate kites and kite strings that could pose a risk to two-wheeler riders, police said.Several two-wheeler riders have been critically injured in the past few years while riding on flyovers. Some have died of injuries.“We were told to remain vigilant against people flying kites near flyovers. For that binoculars will be used as has been instructed,” an officer said.All police stations around Park Circus have started drone surveillance to zero in on people flying kites in the neighbourhood because most kite-flying accidents happen in the Park Circus area.Such strings have often resulted in two-wheeler riders getting severely injured and some even dying of injuries.In the first step of the “operation”, highrises have been identified for cops to use binoculars from. “If kites are spotted being flown from a building, the men with binoculars will alert their colleagues on the ground and share the building’s location details or the direction in which the kite has been spotted,” an officer said.A few days ago, a man on a scooter on the AJC Bose Road flyover suffered fatal injuries to his throat and face. He was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. He was declared dead at hospital.The biggest problem is the height of the railings of the flyovers where kite strings often get entangled and form a “death trap”, an officer said.“In most of the cases, we have seen kite strings getting entangled between the railings of the flyover and obstructing vehicles. But it is almost impossible to spot the strings, especially while driving, as they are very thin,” the officer said.Taxi strike threatA section of yellow taxi operators has threatened to go off the roads again from June 26 if the state government refuses to increase fares. Bimal Guha, of the Bengal Taxi Association, said the diesel price had gone up several times in the last 11 days and it was “nearly impossible to offer services with the existing fare structure”.“The existing rate is Rs 15 per kilometre. We want it to be raised to Rs 25,” Guha said.",2020-06-19 04:27:00
848,Snehal Sengupta,"Coronavirus: Manager infected, CJ Block bank shut - Telegraph India","A bank in CJ Block was shut down on Monday after its manager was found to have tested positive for Covid.A police officer of the Bidhannagar Commissionerate confirmed the incident and said that all employees had been asked to self-isolate. An employee of the bank said they weren’t authorised to speak about it.At least two constables posted at the Bidhannagar North police station have also tested positive, sending at least five others to quarantine.In AE Block, an elderly resident who was feeling unwell had been prescribed the test by a doctor and he tested positive on June 12. While he called a private nursing home in Nagerbazar to get himself admitted, his family, till Wednesday when this edition went to print, was still awaiting guidance from the corporation.“Family members of the septuagenarian waited for a corporation health team to go conduct tests on them. When no one turned up they called private doctors but sadly, even they were too scared to come. The family is self-quarantining at home now without a clue as to whether they have been affected,” said Tapas Sengupta, secretary of AE Block Samaj Kalyan Sangha.Residents are also alarmed that the lane in front of the house in question has not been cordoned off and the area has not been turned into a containment zone. “When the corporation sent no one to sanitise the place we did it ourselves,” said Sengupta on Wednesday.As per the health department’s latest guidelines on affected areas, issued on June 1, the authorities will be setting up micro-containment units that comprise only the house of the individual who has tested positive. “Unlike earlier, the lanes will not be blocked. Only the residents will be asked not to step out,” a civic official said, explaining why they had not cordoned the street off.  But there was no clear answer as to why the health department was missing in action. “We shall look into it,” is all mayor Krishna Chakraborty said. The corporation has a single doctor on its rolls.No fresh updatesAccording to figures given out by the civic body, at least 275 persons have tested positive for Covid-19 in its 41 wards so far. This includes areas falling under the erstwhile Rajarhat Gopalpur Municipality and places along the VIP Road including Baguiati, Kaikhali, Kestopur and Teghoria that have turned into hotbeds of the disease. No separate figures have been quoted for Salt Lake where till last week there were at least 18 places from where residents had tested positive.Unlike the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Police, neither the Bidhannagar civic body nor the Commissionerate has been updating the list of containment zones and buffer areas on their websites or on other channels.The mayor however, maintains that there have been “no fresh cases”.Sujit Bose back homeMinister and MLA Sujit Bose returned home on June 12 after undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a hospital off the EM Bypass.He was welcomed back by well-wishers lining the street blowing conchshells and showering petals on his car. ",2020-06-19 15:01:00
849,Brinda Sarkar,Locked out at sea for 8 months: Sailor New Town - Telegraph India,"Confined at home for over 80 days, most residents can take it no more. But there are hundreds of Indians locked down for months — some over a year — who are literally at sea.The captain of an oil tanker, who owns an apartment in Mallika Malancha complex in New Town, is one such who has been forced to keep sailing for four months after his contract expired. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, ports around the world were not allowing crew to disembark so he had to keep sailing.“Isolation is no big deal for me. I’ve been in this profession for 20 years where we float around the globe in a metal box for long stretches of time,” the captain, now sailing across the Indian Ocean, told The Telegraph Salt Lake over satellite phone. He has asked to remain anonymous. “What hurts is having to tell my six-year-old son that I cannot be with him despite promising to be home in February.”Merchant ships sail the oceans to transport cargo that is imported and exported between countries — crude oil, palm oil, clothes… “Ninety per cent of world trade is transported by ship and we, seafarers, man these vessels,” he says. “There are employees of different ranks working on the ships and depending on their workload, the duration of their contracts is set. A captain’s is usually four months.”This captain’s contract expired when his ship reached the US in February. Ideally, another captain — his reliever — would have flown over to the US port and taken over and he would have flown back to India. “That didn’t happen due to a visa glitch so I had to keep sailing,” he says. “By the time I reached my next port in Thailand, India had sealed its borders. I was locked out.”Burning outThe ship in question has 23 crew members and almost everyone has crossed or is nearing the end of their tenure. The longest stint for anyone aboard is nine months. “There’s a reason why the captain’s tenure is four months. The stress gets unbearable beyond that and productivity reduces. We work 12-hour shifts and I know I’m getting slower at work. If you made a truck driver drive for 48 hours without a break, wouldn’t he become prone to accidents?”The ship has a gym, table tennis board, big screen TV but the internet speed doesn’t allow live streaming of videos. They can speak to their families over the Viber app and satellite telephone. “The air in the oceans is the cleanest in the world, we see the most beautiful sunsets and constellations in the sky but we see no land for months. No alcohol is allowed on board so it’s not like we can chill at a pub after hours. We don’t even have weekly off days. How can we be anything but exhausted?”Missing homeThe captain’s family — mother, wife and son — are in Delhi and he misses them. “My wife is unable to manage the home alone any longer. She is pleading with me to return. She says we won’t go out anywhere but just wants me back. People on land don’t value this,” he says.The captain usually plans his time at sea such that he can return for his son’s summer holidays. “Every summer we visit Calcutta and stay at our New Town house.”Other seafarers, whose wives are expecting, plan to be home for the final trimester. The pandemic will disappoint them all. “Even our relievers are suffering. The profession is such that we only earn when are on the ship. So there are people stuck on land for months without earning a penny. The lower ranked seafarers will have a tough time repaying EMIs if they cannot sail.”Stuck in red tapeThe solution to the unprecedented issue is chartered flights, says the captain. “My company has been very considerate. From day one, they have been offering to fly us home on chartered flights. It would be expensive but this is a cash-rich industry so it would be possible. They had been lobbying with the Indian government for permission but the officials were dragging their feet.”Seafarers are not starving so their problem is not as acute as that of migrant labourers but the logic is the same, he reasons.“The truth is that the government neither understands the shipping industry nor the nature of our jobs and seafarers are too minuscule a community to matter,” says the captain, claiming that it was unfair to club them with NRIs stranded abroad. “We cannot avail the Vande Bharat flights as ships are slow and it is tough to predict the exact time of reaching a port. So which flight do we catch? We have been serving the world during the pandemic by keeping the supply chain smooth; do we not deserve some consideration?” he argues.Hope in heartAfter months of lobbying, the shipping company the captain works for has acquired permission for chartered flights and if all goes well, he should reach a port in Sri Lanka tomorrow and have a private plane fly him to India. “I don’t know the details yet. Maybe I’ll be sent to Mumbai and be quarantined there for two weeks,” he says.But as of now, he will be happy to be on land; his motherland.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-06-19 15:01:00
850,Brinda Sarkar,Hounded at home: Domestic violence during lockdown - Telegraph India,"A man was booked recently for trying to force his six-month pregnant wife to abort their child. He has lost his job during the lockdown and reasoned that they could not afford a baby. When the wife refused, the man and his parents tortured her.This is just one of the many cases of domestic violence reported this lockdown season, shared Kakali Ghosh Kundu, inspector in charge (IC) at a women’s police station. She was speaking at a webinar organised by PeaceLiveLaugh, a counselling, life coaching and mental health unit with a branch in BL Block. The webinar had invited experts to share their observations.“Previously the National Commission for Women would register 4,500 to 5,000 cases of domestic violence a month. Once the lockdown began, this figure doubled in weeks,” said Rajashree Kundalia, a high court lawyer. “Previously there was a home front and office front but now there is no outlet in office, so many are resorting to violence at home to vent their frustration.”However, domestic violence is not restricted to the lockdown period. Or to women. Or to the lower economic class. Domestic violence is more common than you think and the best weapon against it is awareness.Countless cases“Home, sadly, is not a safe haven for everyone,” said youth counsellor Navmita Bhattacharjee. “Domestic violence can happen to everyone — the wife of a rickshaw-puller, a career-oriented woman, a homemaker from a wealthy family… In fact, it is the wealthy ones who are most ashamed to talk about it openly as they want to protect family reputation.”Ghosh Kundu, IC of Baruipur women’s police station, then shared the kind of complaints they have been receiving since the lockdown. There was a lady whose five-year child was critically ill. Her father sold his land to raise funds for treatment but the lady’s husband fled with the money. Another woman was getting beaten up by her brothers when she moved back with them after her husband deserted her.Yet another woman’s husband was long having an extra-marital affair but wasn’t being able to meet the woman due to the lockdown. One find day he went out, brought home his paramour — a college teacher at that — and asked the wife to get out.“Many parents are trying to get their minor daughters married off. To parents who have lost their jobs, a daughter is simply another stomach to feed. Marrying them off is good riddance and if they can do it during the lockdown they don’t have to throw a feast. We are getting two to three such cases a day. Since no one verifies the credentials of the grooms, these girls may get trafficked after the lockdown,” said Ghosh Kundu, who is also in charge of the district anti-human trafficking unit.The number of domestic violence cases they received during the lockdown was less than that of previous months but this is hardly a fact to cheer about. “Complaints are low as victims are unable to find transport to reach the thana and lodge complaints,” the officer said. “Previously neighbours who overheard a woman getting beaten up would at least go over and stop the husband. Now due to stay-home orders, even that is not happening so the battery has worsened.”Why they don’t fight backBhattacharjee explained why women are reluctant to walk out of abusive relationships. “Firstly, it takes them years to realise that they are victims of domestic violence. They keep justifying the husband’s behaviour, saying he’s behaving this way because he is worried about something or that he’s a good person but cannot control his anger,” she said.In some cases, women fight their families to marry these men and thereafter cannot come to accept that the person they fought so hard for is assaulting them. “It is difficult for a woman who loves her husband to label him a wife-beater. She’ll defend him saying he only gets violent for an hour but at other times gives her whatever she asks for; that he’s a good father to their children…. They unknowingly support the men’s behaviour.”After years of such excuses, a fear psychosis sets in and the woman starts blaming herself. “He beat me because I reached home late,” she’ll say, absolving her husband. Living-in-fear becomes her lifestyle. She thinks this is her life and this is what she has to live with, explained Bhattacharjee.Kundalia added stigma to the problem. “People think domestic violence is a part of society and so there is nothing to complain about. Often, the joint family system doesn’t welcome back a married woman so where does she get the courage to raise a voice against her abuser?” she said, asking people to broaden their understanding of domestic violence.“It is not just physical abuse. It can be verbal; it can be the act of restraining someone from become self-reliant. If you cannot grow yourself educationally, financially, emotionally, you are being abused,” she said.Kundalia cited the case of a lady, married for 25 years and with two grown children, who gets beaten every now and then. “The morning after, mind you, the husband invariably takes her shopping. What women need to understand is that compensation doesn’t right a wrong,” she emphasised.Kakoli Das Mandal, psychotherapist and co-founder of PeaceLiveLaugh, moderated the session. She asked women to not make excuses for errant husbands. “Don’t tell yourself he is beating you as he is stressed out by the lockdown. If he’s doing it now he’ll do it forever,” she said.What she can doBhattacharjee asked women to stand up for themselves. “The first time he hits you, he’s testing your reaction. If you’re passive, he’ll know he can dominate you. So if you are abused, retaliate. Don’t hit him back but be assertive and tell him to stop,” she said.As a lawyer, Kundalia’s first advice is to ask the women not to leave home. “The marital home is legally yours,” she said. “India still has a lot of homemakers and in such cases the man is richer than the woman. She may be on the back foot but one phone call to the man from the police station will keep him in check. Complain not to name and shame him but to tell him that you won’t accept abuse,” she asserted.Ghosh Kundu explained how women’s police stations — that specifically cater to women, children and the elderly (Salt Lake has one on the premises of the Electronics Complex police station in Sector V. Ultadanga thana too houses one) — have a high number of women police personnel. “Women feel more comfortable lodging complaints here,” she said.In case a woman cannot afford legal proceedings, Kundalia said she can avail of lawyers free of cost using the Legal Aid service. “For this, she has to lodge an FIR with the police and they will guide her to it. In case she has no place to stay, they will put her up at a women’s shelter home, where she will be taught vocations to help her become financially independent,” explained the lawyer.Still, she said she always suggests mediation before legal proceedings. “It saves money, time, energy, harassment and emotional drain.”Victim-bashingA member of the audience shared her ongoing ordeal of trying to separate from her allegedly abusive husband and win custody of their son. Let alone legal proceedings, she said she was exhausted from the way society treated her.“Since I’m an educated woman with a career, people think I’m scheming to exploit my husband,” she said. “He’s from the defence sector and wins all the sympathy as people treat him like a war hero without realising he can be abusive too. Well-wishers have told me to play the “abala nari” (helpless woman) card to garner sympathy as public perception goes against empowered women.”Men on receiving endNow-a-days there are educated women who misuse their rights to get back at their husbands, cited Kundalia. “They write to their husband’s offices falsely accusing them of abuse, get their husbands arrested by lying to the police... Some marry repeatedly for alimony. There are websites now brokering second and third marriages.”Since domestic violence against men is few and far between and since men are the traditional perpetrators, society wants to continue blaming them, she noted.Children beaten upA member of the audience recalled how a neighbour would watch Kaun Banega Crorepati with his son — aged between 12 and 14 — and beat the boy whenever the child failed to answer a question asked on TV. “As a child, I myself have been thrashed a couple of times by my father when he was inebriated. Do these fall under domestic violence?” he wondered.Yes, they do. Ghosh Kundu said anyone can and must call Childline at 1098 to complain about children being abused. “If you can provide adequate information, it can even be an anonymous call,” she said. “They will intervene and save the child. There are strong laws to protect the rights of children.”Kundalia said the starting point to teaching children their rights was to tell them not to accept any behaviour they do not like.“As per Unicef, around 275 million children worldwide are exposed to violence at home. They face the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder as severe as in soldiers returning from war. Men who are abused as children or see their mothers being abused are more likely to hit their wives too,” said Das Mandal. “We have to break this cycle to protect the future generation and the first step is to share your problems and speak to experts who can help.”Elderly neglectedJune 15 was World Elder Abuse Awareness Day and HelpAge India, Calcutta, held a webinar on “Elders in the time of Covid-19” along with the department of women and child development and social welfare.“While we did not get any specific calls of abuse during the lockdown, it is a fact that younger family members vented their frustration on the elderly at home,” said Anuradha Sen, a resident of CL Block and director, advocacy, HelpAge India.The webinar mentioned subtle cases of neglect. For instance, if masks were bought and were being handed over to all at home, the elderly could have been overlooked since “they hardly go out”. “Neglect is a form of abuse too,” said Sen.Have you heard of cases of domestic violence in your neighbourhood?

852,Our Special Correspondent,Covid-19: 6 coronavirus cases in a day in New Town - Telegraph India,"New Town saw the biggest single day spike in Covid-19 cases with six tests coming positive on Saturday.Three were from a family at Rosedale Garden. “Two more are to be tested for being in contact with them,” a source said. An elderly resident of CC Block died while her son has since been hospitalised. A resident of CA Block, who flew to Tripura, tested positive on landing. A Millennium Tower resident, who recently visited a hospital, has tested positive. Earlier, a case was reported in New Town Heights while Hiland Woods reported one this week. The number of cases in New Town now totals 29.NKDA has been conducting door-to-door fever surveys. “We are asking for travel history in the last 14 days and checking temperature with thermal gun.

853,TT Bureau,DD Block temple to hold sole outdoor Rathyatra - Telegraph India,"Rathyatra is slated for June 23 but the pandemic-induced lockdown has ensured that celebrations are rather muted this year.Bidhannagar Ramakrishna Vivekananda Kendra is perhaps the only institute in Salt Lake that plans an outdoor procession. “But we expect very few devotees. We have now opened for devotees on a regular basis but even for that people are too scared to step out so I’m sure the procession will be a small affair. We shall walk around DD Block and maintain social distancing,” says president of the body, Chanchal De, adding that a special prayer for respite from Covid-19 will follow.Being a place of worship, the centre had acquired police permission to observe rituals all through the lockdown, even if no devotees were allowed to come. “Blocks and clubs are now wondering about the fate of Durga puja but on the day of Lord Jagannath’s snan yatra in early June we went and paid an advance amount to our idol-maker for our Durga puja. The day is said to be auspicious and we do this traditionally every year on this day.”The Shri Jagannath Utsav Samity rathyatra is so popular that the house it starts from — CB 54 opposite Tank 2 — is known as the rath bari among locals. Every year, thousands throng to pull the rope that draws the chariots of the lords. As part of the procession are trailers with bhajan singers, classical dancers and priests who distribute prasad to motorists and passers-by.“This year, the idols will not be taken out of the house. Nor can we allow devotees to come into the house to seek blessings,” says Manas Rawat, at whose CB 54 house the idols stay. “My parents and uncle are senior citizens with co-morbidities and we cannot take a chance. Next year, we shall have a grand celebration,” he promises.  The other big procession — by Bidhannagar Sree Chaitanya Bhagabat Samaj — usually takes off from opposite Tank 2, roams the township and culminates at Central Park, where a Rath er Mela commences. “This year we are thinking of tracing our regular route by car. We shall place the idols of Jagannath, Balaram and Subhadra in three separate cars and make a symbolic halt outside Central Park. The idol will return to BF 20 at the end of the trip,” says general secretary of the body, Kumar Sankar Sadhu.At CB Block, the idol will be taken out of the house from one door and brought in through the other, to symbolise a yatra. At BF Block, devotees will be allowed in but 10 at a time, provided they wear masks and use sanitisers before darshan. “We are receiving many calls from people who come every year. Far from feeling dejected, they are consoling us and telling us that we shall make up for this year in 2021. Our group is very happy to have made such a special place in people’s hearts,” said Sadhu, a resident of GD Block.Sri Jagannath Seva Samiti, which holds its rathyatra from Central Park to Swabhumi, has cancelled the festival altogether. “Our idols come from our Kidderpore temple all the way to Salt Lake since 2003. But this year, the Lord will only get down from the first floor of the temple to the meeting hall on the ground floor,” said member G.K. Swain. The week-long cultural programme at Swabhumi, organised by the Samiti’s cultural wing Utkala, will not be held either.Digital offeringDB Block had been celebrating Rathyatra for the last few years and so this time a group of ladies in the block — calling themselves Gulabi Gang — have planned a celebration over Skype video call. “Rinku Banerjee, who has a Jagannath idol, will begin the show by blowing a conchshell before it. I’m sure one of us will have a miniature rath at home that we’ll give her beforehand. Rinku will decorate it and move it around, with the idol seated inside,” says Sonali Basak, one of the members.The ladies will then perform music, dance and recitation themed around Krishna and the dashavatara. “The vote of thanks will also weave in the 108 names of Krishna. We will miss the gathering and bhog of the community event but at least we’ll be able to offer something to the lord,” says Basak.",2020-06-19 15:10:00
854,Anuradha Rathore,Go local with tree choices: Cyclone Amphan New Town - Telegraph India,"Calcutta witnessed a disastrous cyclone on May 20, losing over 25,000 trees in four hours of mayhem. Along with the uprooted trees and broken branches the fragile system of electrical and communication networking which still runs above ground in most part of the city too came crashing down. Though the cables are underground in New Town, the township’s greenery was not spared. Plantations have been done here mostly in the past seven or eight years but the cyclone uprooted over 4,000 of the young trees.The cyclone was blamed for the devastating loss of greenery.As a landscape architect, I went out two days later to understand the impact. And in my assessment, over 80 per cent of the trees got uprooted because of human greed and disregard for the nature. All over the city we saw large trees uprooted from their base. But what was most surprising was that even trees of 10-12m diameter were showing only a petite 1.5m wide root balls! Rest of the roots couldn’t grow or had died.Looking at the uprooted trees, it could be understood that most of them did not have the required underground growth due to hard paving surface built tightly around them and infrastructure lines cutting across their roots, thus making them redundant. Many of the trees had tight brick or concrete pedestals built around them. This further limited the growth of the roots.Let’s understand the structure of the roots. Common belief is that the roots are around the trunk of the tree and spread around the tree drip line (external ends of a tree’s foliage). But actually the roots spread more than 1.5 -2 times the diameter of the tree canopy (see illustration). The roots are also concentrated at a depth of barely 1 to 2 feet under the surface. These roots provide water and nutrients to the tree and also give the necessary anchor strength to the tree mass above.In Eco Park, many species of trees which did not fall in the city also fell in the rainforest because of the high percentage of sand in the soil which was used to fill it up. The sand helped the growth of the trees but their roots could not anchor themselves well.Also it was observed that the city has been planted mostly with fast- growing trees like Radhachura, Krishnachura, Kadam, Spathodea etc. Time and again during various thunderstorms, these trees have broken down and done a lot of harm. We have to resist from planting these trees on the roads. They offer nice flowering colours but should be limited to within parks and gardens.Tensile strength (ability to bend without breaking) of branches is better in slow-growing native trees of Bengal like Aswattha, which therefore can sustain better.Due to climatic change, there will be 27 to 30 per cent increase in cyclone frequency. So we have to prepare in a way that our greenery does not suffer every time a cyclone comes. My solution is a 4N approach.1. Nests - Roadside greens have the capacity to provide 30 to 40 per cent greenery to the city and should be developed more scientifically as urban nests. Pedestrian pathways and infrastructure lines can be planned giving enough space for root development. Where there is less space, like on the Major Arterial Road where dedicated plantations on both sides face heavy pressure of infrastructure beneath, new technology like permeable resin pathways or permeable concrete should be used. Silva cells or root cells can be used with pathways above and roots can grow under it. Silva cells are high density polymer units which can be laid under the pathway and which provide a modular suspended pavement system for containing healthy soil beneath paving while supporting traffic loads and accommodating surrounding service lines. It solves the problem of the root ball not getting enough nutrition.Indigenous trees like Alstonia Scholaris (chhatim), Minlingtonia Hortensis, Terminalis Arjun, Mango, Dalbergia Sissoo etc should be planted. Radhachura and Krishnachura may have Indian names but are introduced varieties.2. Nomenclature – Venue plantation of strong visual quality and naming a street on the type of tree chosen for it creates a special identity for those streets. Users and visitors relate to them very well.3. Neurological effects - Urban greenery has a strong effect on the urban happiness index, which is very important in inviting financial investments to a metropolitan city. Thick greening in various layers — shrubs, ground cover, trees and climbers, all should be planned scientifically for maximum benefit. These layers should be used for trapping dust, CO2 and urban noise.4. Nurture – It is most important to preserve whatever urban greenery we have and nurture the new trees that we plant. For this, a legislative approach has to be taken up. A tree health management team should be constituted with stakeholders from the government, NGOs, professionals and activists. Also new townships should have a tree act which has a master plan, tree census and a guideline of tree planting for every locality.The writer is a resident of Ujjwala The Condoville and has been in practice for over 15 years",2020-06-19 15:59:00
855,Sudeshna Banerjee,"Plant on empty plots, offer trees for adoption: Cyclone Amphan, New Town, Sector V - Telegraph India","New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is approaching owners of empty plots to allow the use of their land for plantation till they need to use it themselves. Similar requests will also be made by Nabadiganta Industrial Development Authority (NDITA) in Sector V.  This is one of the strategies devised to replenish the green cover in New Town and neighbouring Sector V that was damaged by cyclone Amphan.According to an official survey, 4,647 trees got damaged in the township on the fateful night of May 20. Though 3,738 of them could be restored, the target now is to plant 10,000 trees to compensate for the loss.“There are a lot of unused empty plots which are overgrown with parthenium and other weeds. Garbage gets dumped there and they become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. There is no point cleaning them as the weeds are back in no time. We are writing to the owners to let us plant trees there. When they need to build on the plot, we will harvest or remove the trees. This will increase our green cover significantly,” said Debashis Sen, who heads NKDA, NDITA and Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco).While Hidco owns the land in New Town, in Sector V it is the urban development department that is the owner of the land. “I have already sent the proposal to urban development minister Firhad Hakim and secretary Khalil Ahmed. It will not be a profit-making venture but problems like dengue and asthma arising out of these plots can be fruitfully tackled this way,” he said. Parthenium pollens trigger allergies like contact dermatitis and hay fever and also cause respiratory distress in bronchial asthma patients.The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is likely to associate in the plantation drive. “We will also approach nurseries, schools and residents’ associations,” he said.NKDA has also asked the forest department for 10,000 saplings. “We are asking only for tall trees as that is the chief minister’s directive. The chosen trees include guava and pomegranate. You can mature them and cut them when needed,” an NKDA official said.Another plan is to ask residents’ welfare associations and corporate houses to adopt trees in their neighbourhood and maintain them. “They can have their names put up on them, as per our format, without using nails.”They are also being asked to plant trees. “We are recommending tall trees. We will provide land for plantation or they can do it on their own land but only after authentication from us on the basis of microplanning,” Sen said. According to sources, architect Anuradha Rathore has been asked to prepare a draft paper.A senior forest department official confirmed receiving a request for technical knowhow and supply of planting material from Hidco. “We have adequate stock of aged saplings. They have to tell us the age they want,” he said. The department runs the Tall Tree Nursery in Action Area 1 as a joint venture with Hidco.Pointing out the necessity for planned plantation, he spoke of the landscaping the department had done on the Bypass from Chingrihata to Garia in the winter of 2016. “We planted palm trees and other short canopy varieties. A few may have got bent but not a single one got uprooted in the cyclone,” he said.He also pointed to the tunnel effect created by highrises in places like New Town. “The wind speed will be multiple of what it is elsewhere in some parts of the gated communities. You have to keep these factors in mind and go for short canopy dwarf varieties in such places.”The New Town authority is targeting Forestry Week, starting July 14, to go big with the project. ",2020-06-19 15:59:00
856,Brinda Sarkar,BF Block residents restore fallen banyan tree: Cyclone Amphan - Telegraph India,"BF Block residents pooled in about Rs 26,000 to restore a massive banyan tree that had fallen opposite their community hall during the cyclone.“Many trees had fallen during Amphan but this one held great sentimental value for us,” said block secretary Shibangsu Sarkar, about the tree that was planted in the early ’80s by block committee members. Current president T.P. Dutta was one of those who had planted it.After the tree’s fall, the block’s WhatsApp group was flooded with condolence messages. Sanchaita Mondal reflected on how “aunties in the block” would sing under that tree during Rabindrajayanti. Barnali Biswas remembers her toddler son sitting under the tree with her father.“News of that tree’s fall moved us so much that we decided to restore it,” said Sarkar. “Some residents donated Rs 5,000, some Rs 100, some simply encouraged us. But it gave us impetus.”The legwork was done by youths like Chetan Mukherjee, Ranabir Bhattacharya, Soham Sarkar and Sayan Ghosh, who got in touch with the NGO Nature Mates for help.On June 7, the NGO sent a lifting crane to pull up the tree, make it stand erect and prop up its trunk with a tent-like scaffolding. “Since the roots are weak, scaffolding is needed to protect it from other storms,” said Arabinda Narayan Dolai of Nature Mates, who supervised the project. “We have also strengthened it with ropes. The tree should be fine in a year.”The mammoth exercise began at 9am and ended at 8.30pm, interrupted by two showers. “Now residents are so happy!” says Sarkar. “They are going to check every day if new leaves have sprouted. It’s as if the tree symbolises hope of survival at a time that world is fighting Covid-19.”The committee laments that restoration of trees was not done on a larger scale. “Salt Lake has more than 50 blocks and even if every block had restored one tree that many trees would have survived,” said Sarkar.",2020-06-19 16:53:00
857,Jayanta Basu,"10,000 trees in and around Salt Lake - Telegraph India","The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) has decided to plant 10,000 trees by July in Salt Lake and adjoining areas like VIP Road leading to the airport, as part of chief minister Mamata Banerjee mandated greening drive in the state post-Amphan cyclone.On June 5, the world environment day, Banerjee had announced that the state government would plant 85 million trees in the state, including 50 million mangroves in the Sunderbans, which has been severely affected by the cyclone.At a world environment day event held at the state PCB headquarters in Salt Lake, environment minister Saumen Mahapatra emphasised the need to undertake an extensive plantation drive to repair the environmental damages inflicted by the cyclone.The minister planted a tree to initiate the plantation process and announced a Rs 5 crore budget for the drive. But he cautioned that unless scientific planting was pursued, such disasters would recur. State environment secretary Vivek Kumar and PCB environment secretary Rajesh Kumar accompanied minister.“We have decided to plant 10,000 trees at roadsides as well as on road dividers, mainly in the Salt Lake area as well as on the VIP Road stretch from Hudco crossing to the airport as part of the greening drive announced by the chief minister” WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra told The Telegraph Salt Lake.According to a Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation official, the township had lost over 3,000 trees during the extremely severe cyclone that pummelled by Salt Lake during evening of May 20 after having made landfall near Sagar island.Rudra said that that the tender process had been initiated last week and the PCB planned to complete the planting by July. The total cost of plantation is expected to be around Rs 2.5 crore.“The agency to be selected for the plantation will have to take responsibility of planting reasonably mature plants along with the tree guard and will have to look after the trees for two years,” added Rudra.In consultation with experts, PCB has selected 24 mainly indigenous and fruit-bearing varieties for road-side plantation. They include neem, bakul, haritaki, amloki, sishoo, chhatim, ashok, kath badam, rudra palash, aswattha, arjun etc.For the road dividers, five species  have primarily been chosen — kamini, jaba, gulancha, karabi and rangan — all of which are shrubs.Rudra said that that the green regulator has plans to undertake planting not only in and around Salt Lake but also in a 25km zone around Calcutta. The greening of Calcutta will be undertaken by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation itself.",2020-06-19 16:53:00

It is increasing bonding among neighbours, with youngsters helping the elderly.We also contributed to the Jain Purvanchal Terapanth Yuvak Parishad, which is disturbing food and medicine to the needy. I have been following only government websites for updates instead of believing and spreading social media forwards.The lockdown is a fight of, for and by humanity. We people are staying at home but the real heroes are those working outside. The grocers, home delivery people, chemists, garbage collectors, fruit and vegetable growers and sellers, the police, health workers, researchers and NGO members are risking their lives to serve and protect us.Sandip SenguptaResident of: Vidyasagar NiketanI have not witnessed World War II but have heard a lot about it from my parents. Going by what I see around me now, I am sure the Covid-19 crisis is no less than a war.Since I am a senior citizen, and thus more susceptible to risk than others, I have totally confined myself at home. I am keeping myself busy by doing routine household tasks daily. I start the day by making breakfast for me and my missus, who generally takes care of shopping for essentials nowadays along with cooking and managing other household chores.After breakfast, I do some dusting and help with other indoor activities like washing utensils etc. Just before lunch and dinner, I heat food and try to arrange the table.Since I am generally involved in work that requires me to go outdoors on normal days, the lockdown has surely made me realise how challenging and underrated regular household chores are. Hats off to my wife and all homemakers!During afternoons, I scan through The Telegraph in detail and keep myself abreast of all the latest Covid-19-related news and happenings all over the world. But for the sake of my mental well-being, I make it a point not to watch too much TV 'breaking news'!I also try to do some freehand exercise and asanas during early evening on our apartment terrace to keep myself physically fit. If I get time, I listen to music on my CD player and on TV, and connect with my friends and family over phone.My main objective during this lockdown period is to chronicle my daily life and thoughts in a diary, which I plan to give to my grand-daughter, Raisa, later. Since she is less than a year old now, I can't explain the world situation to her right away.

860,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Cargo-on-seat flight to cut losses - Telegraph India,"An AirAsia flight from Calcutta took off for Chennai on Thursday night, with pilots and cabin crew and seats almost full. Only, instead of passengers, there were cartons and containers.This was the airline’s first cargo-on-seat flight, a new model approved by the civil aviation ministry to allow airlines to make up for some of their losses inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic.Now, many airlines are converting passenger planes into cargo aircraft on certain routes because there are not enough passengers to make a flight viable.The Airbus A-320 aircraft of AirAsia, which has 180 seats for passengers, carried eight tonnes of cargo, about half of which was kept on passenger seats and the rest in the belly space, airline officials said. The cargo contained fertilised fish eggs, litchis and mails and parcels.The boxes were tied to the seats with ropes. The cabin crew, used to serving meals and making announcements, was assigned an unusual duty — to ensure that no box fell off the seat or from any overhead compartment.Fire-proof seat and arm covers were placed on the normal seats as an added precaution.“The aircraft was sanitised before Calcutta-bound passengers boarded it at the Chennai airport on Friday,” said an official of AirAsia.The airline had to take approval of the directorate general of civil aviation for carrying cargo on passenger seats.Calcutta airport officials said SpiceJet and IndiGo operated similar cargo-on-seat flights from Calcutta on Friday. The SpiceJet flight brought cargo from Chennai and took off with a fresh set of cargo for Surat. The IndiGo flight took off with cargo for Delhi.The first cargo-on-seat flight was operated by SpiceJet on April 7. The aircraft had carried 11 tonnes of cargo from Delhi to Chennai and onwards to Surat.Aviation industry sources said that during the Covid-19 lockdown, when passenger flights were stalled, airlines were using some of their grounded aircraft to carry essential cargo.After lockdown norms were eased and domestic flights resumed from the last week of May, airlines are continuing with the cargo-on-seat scheme because they are not getting enough revenue from passenger flights, said sources.“A few flights from Calcutta, with a capacity to carry 180 passengers, are having 100 seats filled. Some are even having as low as 10 passengers,” said an official of a private airline. “That is because only people with real necessity are travelling.”On June 18, 67 flights took off from Calcutta with 4,366 passengers. That means on an average around 65 passengers travelled on each flight out of Calcutta.Airlines sources said because of low passenger count, some flights have to be cancelled and the passengers are accommodated on other flights.“But the scheduled return flight against a cancelled one might have many passengers and cancelling that would not be viable. So, cargo is being carried on passenger seats, in addition to what the aircraft’s belly can accommodate, on the onward journey,” an official said.An IndiGo spokesperson said the airline had operated more than 40 such cargo-on-seat flights out of Calcutta so far in June, 37 of which flew to international destinations.“Many airlines are operating chartered flights, too, along with cargo-on-seat flights,” said Kaushik Bhattacharya, Calcutta airport’s director.Airport sources said IndiGo had operated several chartered flights from Doha to Calcutta bringing in stranded Indians.

My daughter did not attend the class… the situation is beyond my control,” psychiatrist S. Das said.Priyanka Kar and her husband resumed office a few weeks back. Kar has to leave for work at 8am and her son’s classes start at 8.30am. She has had to make arrangements to get her mother to their house every morning.“We are facing a lot of issues because my son, a Class III student, is not old enough to handle the desktop on his own and my mother, too, is not well-versed with computers,” she said.Kar works in a cement manufacturing company.Net connectivity has been a problem in many homes in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan.Kar said she bought her mother a smartphone to send study links for her son. It also acts as a back-up device in case the Wi-Fi is slow, she said.Schools generally send a meeting ID and password to a parent’s phone a few minutes before class. “I have to send the link so that they can log in. It’s not been very easy,” Kar said.But unlike Kar, many parents haven’t been able to afford another phone or a laptop in such trying times. “We have received requests from parents that their children won’t be able to submit the day’s assignment by the scheduled deadline (2pm) because both parents are at work. We have allowed them to submit the assignments by evening after they return home,” Sanchita Biswas, principal of St Paul’s Mission School, said.At Sri Sri Academy, the school is holding classes on Saturdays for the benefit of those missing classes on a weekday.Parents are worried about leaving their children with electronic devices on their own with possible access to various age-inappropriate sites.“I might not be sitting with my son throughout the day while he is attending classes but he knows that I am around and he cannot visit a site, which is not suitable for him,” the mother of a Class IX student said.",2020-06-20 03:16:00
863,Jhinuk Mazumdar,ISC council query on assessment standard - Telegraph India,"The ISC council has asked schools affiliated to it why their assessment in pre-board tests differs from the council’s in the board exams, several principals who attended a meeting with council officials on Friday said.Scores in pre-board exams are hardly an indicator of a student’s standard because many schools, especially reputable ones, are allegedly stingy in awarding marks in internal exams.The difference in the standard of evaluation is prompting many students to decide to write the pending papers of ISC and ICSE exams, exposing themselves to the risk of contracting Covid-19 in the process, instead of agreeing to be assessed on the basis of their pre-board marks.The council has given both choices to the ICSE and ISC examinees.Friday’s meeting, where the schools were asked about their strict evaluation in pre-board exams, was addressed by Gerry Arathoon, the chief executive and secretary of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations.Several parents have told The Telegraph that their children want to write the pending papers in the hope that they would score more marks than they have scored in the pre-board exams.Eight ISC and six ICSE papers are still pending because the exams had to be suspended in March to protect the children from being infected by the coronavirus at the test venues.For decades it has been a tradition in many schools to set difficult questions and be strict in evaluation. The questions set in the board exams is a mix of tough and easy ones, which help all students to score better than in pre-board exams.Several schools do it intentionally to make students work harder for the board exams.The higher scores in the board exams do not just reflect the student’s performance but are also indicative of the standard a school maintain, which is not dependent on the council’s parameters alone.“Sometimes the benchmark is much higher than the benchmark set by the council,” a teacher said.“Parents send their children to a certain school because of the standard and quality it maintains and we cannot dilute that. Sometimes, the questions in the pre-boards require students to apply their minds and that help them in future,” said a principal.The council also reminded principals that they should not try to influence the decision of the students on whether they will write the pending papers or be assessed by the marks in the internal exams.",2020-06-20 03:19:00

MRP tag has no consequences. Please keep it in mind while billing the patients,” retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory, stated in a voice message posted on a closed WhatsApp group.Private hospitals are members of the group.In another post, Banerjee said “unpleasant complaints” were pouring into the commission’s office over billing. He urged private hospitals to mail the updated bill to the patient or a family member every day to maintain transparency.“We have received reports that some private hospitals are charging an amount for PPE which is much higher than the procurement price. There is no parity. As for the number of PPE, patients are being charged arbitrarily,” said an official of the health department.Some hospitals, he said, are charging up to Rs 2,000 for one PPE.The Telegraph reported on Friday that chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had on Thursday raised the issue of PPE with private hospitals.Some hospitals said they were charging the patients just the procurement price of PPE. “We are charging the procurement cost. The number of PPE for which a patient is being charged is calculated on the basis of the number of doctors and nurses in a ward, the number of shifts in a day and the number of patients in the ward,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital.The commission chairperson has also requested private diagnostic laboratories to reconsider the rates of Covid-19 tests. “The number of tests has gone up…. It is high time, you consider the cost of tests,” Banerjee had said in a post in the WhatsApp group on Thursday night.On Friday, several hospitals and laboratories announced reduction of test rates.“In deference to the desire of the state government, as advised by the chief secretary and other senior government officials, Medica is pleased to reduce the charges of RT-PCR tests to Rs 2,400,” said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica group of hospitals.Sources said two laboratories, too, reduced the rate to Rs 2,400. Earlier, they were charging Rs 2,800.The Indian Council of Medical Research has capped the test rate at Rs 4,500.

866,Debraj Mitra,Drivers for hire over app in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A group of Calcuttans in their early 20s has started an app-based driver rental platform that has been generating both online traction and business on the ground.The city is brimming with pop-up “driver centres” in almost every neighbourhood but Drivers4Me offers tech-based solutions to several teething problems in hiring a driver from conventional places.The app offers various conveniences such as getting to see a copy of the driving licence, hiring a driver for a minimum of two hours or hiring a driver only for a one-way trip.The standard rate of hiring a driver from a centre is upwards of Rs 300 for five hours. Driver centres are numerous but one thing is common — the rate is fixed for five to six hours. Even if a driver is needed for just a few hours, the rate is non-negotiable. The centres charge drivers for round trips.On Friday afternoon, the charge of hiring a driver for two hours through the app was Rs 160. The pickup location was in Behala. A couple of minutes into the booking confirmation, details of the driver — picture, licence and Aadhaar card — were available on the app.Live tracking and “detailed background check on drivers” are some of the other features of Drivers4Me, which was launched in August 2018.Drivers4Me, available on iOS, Android and Web, offers drivers for private or commercial vehicles.“The app has had more than 60,000 rides since inception. We have more than 700 driver partners. Over 200 drive only for us and the rest for app cab aggregators as well. There are over 20,000 customers on the platform. Our fare is dynamic but still very competitive,” Paramartha Saha, 23, one of the founders of the start-up, said.The app is the brainchild of a group of young techies — all of who graduated from the Institute of Engineering and Management in 2018.All had secured jobs through campus recruitments but took the entrepreneurial plunge.“There is a driver centre in almost every neighbourhood in the city but the sector is extremely unorganised. We saw a huge potential in the sector and took the plunge,” Rajarshi Nag, 22, another of the founders, said.His father is a retired central government employee. His parents wanted him to go for a traditional job, Nag, who left his job with an Indian IT services multinational company, said.“We sensed this idea had a solid business potential. There was no brick-and-mortar investment, only hard work,” he told Metro.The app had been in the works since the group’s student days. Their first office, a cramped room in Salt Lake near Nalban, was provided by their institute’s dean.Now, Drivers4Me has “over 14 back office employees sitting inside a spacious office near the Ruby crossing”.A commission from every transaction is the app’s source of earning. The driver keeps the rest.At a time when the lockdown has robbed many of their livelihoods, the young venture has been generating income for many in the city.Sandip Shaw, 32, is one of the “exclusive drivers” on the platform. Shaw lives with his father and sister at a rented accommodation in Ultadanga. He used to work as a driver with a real estate company. He has been with Drivers4Me since its inception. “These are troubled times. Many of my friends have lost their jobs. But I still earn around Rs 15,000 a month, enough to sustain my family,” Shaw told Metro.The Covid-19 curbs have dented the business but to offset some of the losses, Drivers4Me collaborated with pharma players for home delivery of medicines.For now, the bulk of the service is in Calcutta and Salt Lake, though there are outstation options as well.“We want to start B2C (business to consumer) services in other cities in the future,” Ronit Ray, another founder of the start-up, said.",2020-06-20 04:15:00
867,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus pandemic: Civic helpline redirects callers to cops - Telegraph India,"Residents calling the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s Covid-19 helpline are being told to seek help from their nearest police station, they have alleged.Residents of various blocks in Salt Lake told The Telegraph on Friday that they had called the helpline on multiple occasions only to be told “thanay khobor din (alert police station)”.The corporation had launched the helpline a few days after the Centre announced the lockdown in March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Arpita Chatterjee, 76, a retired schoolteacher who lives in AD Block — which had reported the first coronavirus patient in Salt Lake — said she had called the helpline to enquire about a swab test.“I had called the number last week. I have fever and I wanted to find out if the corporation would help me get a Covid test done. I was taken aback when they said I should call the police station,” Chatterjee said.Cops are facing problems because the civic authorities are passing the buck to them, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.Cops are acting as “liaison officers” between the state health department and civic officials, the officer said. “We can be of little help apart from arranging ambulances to transport patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus and to escort family members to institutional quarantine units if required.”A septuagenarian who lives in DB Block from where several residents have tested positive for the virus said he had called the helpline multiple times to request for a sanitisation drive.“Every time I dialled the helpline, they asked me to call the police. When I asked if cops were now supposed to spray disinfectants, they simply disconnected the line,” Basu said.Apart from the helpline, residents can call councillors directly in case they faced any problems, Krishna Chakraborty, the Bidhannagar mayor, said. “I will look into the allegations… why those manning the helpline are replying in this manner. Residents can call the ward councillor directly for help.”The civic body has one doctor for its 41 wards, a civic official said. The corporation has an “uphill struggle” to visit houses of people reporting symptoms of Covid-19 and conduct tests on them, the official said. “We have a small health team and we are faced with a severe manpower shortage.”Calls to mayoral council member Pranay Kumar Ray who heads the health department went unanswered.Salt Lake has a sizeable population of senior citizens. More than 280 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the township till Friday.Apart from 18 places in Salt Lake, these people are from the erstwhile Rajarhat-Gopalpur Municipality, Baguiati, Kaikhali, Kestopur, and Teghoria.A bank in CJ Block was shut down after its manager tested positive for Covid-19. At least two constables attached with Bidhannagar North police station have tested positive for the virus, sending at least five others to quarantine.",2020-06-20 04:16:00
868,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus pandemic: Private lab Covid test results under scrutiny - Telegraph India,"The state health department has decided to run second checks on samples collected from private laboratories conducting Covid tests following allegations their results were faulty.The samples collected from private laboratories will be tested separately and the results compared with those of the laboratories, a health department official said.The health department has been receiving complaints for the past month-and-a-half about results being negative in the first instance and then positive at times within three to four days. There have been several instances of patients returning home after being declared Covid negative by a private clinic and then turning up at a state Covid hospital within two-three days and testing positive.There are six private laboratories in Calcutta. Barring one, representatives from the remaining five were present at a meeting with senior department officials on Thursday where the decision to conduct random tests was announced.These private laboratories like the government ones have been conducting Covid tests on swab samples using the RT-PCR method.The RT-PCR method involves extraction of RNA of the virus to determine the viral load in a sample.“If the RNA is not extracted properly, results can be misleading. It has happened on several occasions,” a virologist at the School of Tropical Medicine said. “Laboratories where RT-PCR methods are being followed need stringent monitoring.”Health department officials cited the example of the School of Tropical Medicine. “Several weeks ago all test results started turning out to be negative. After investigation, it turned out that the machines had been infected during training sessions of pathologists,” a department official said. “We had to close the laboratory and decontaminate it before resuming tests.”",2020-06-20 04:18:00

870,PTI,Coronavirus: Regulatory body asks Kolkata private hospitals to look into billing complaints regarding Covid-19 treatment - Telegraph India,"After receiving complaints of inflated bills from families of Covid-19 patients, a regulatory body for private hospitals of West Bengal has directed several such facilities of Kolkata to settle the issue, officials said on Saturday.Communications have been sent to a number of private hospitals to resolve billing issues from family members of patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus infection.Complaints of unreasonably high billing were also received from patients suffering from diseases other than Covid-19, a senior official of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) told PTI.The WBCERC has advised private hospitals to employ an official to redress grievances about billing complaints, he said.""The official will be given the independence to settle the billing issues within 24 hours. If patient parties are not satisfied after that, the matter can go to the appellate authority. We hope that most of the complaints will be amicably resolved,"" he said.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is also mulling the option of forwarding similar complaints received at its borough offices to the state health department for necessary action, an official of the civic body said.State Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha on Friday urged authorities of private hospitals not to impose costs of additional medical expenses entirely on the patient parties.",2020-06-20 18:25:00

872,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus pandemic: Trust, the key to Bengal’s Covid-19 protocol for fliers - Telegraph India","Bengal trusts passengers flying into the city to follow home quarantine rules and report any Covid-19 symptom during the isolation period.Southern state Kerala is doing it differently, though.Passengers arriving in Bengal from other states have to sign a form at the airport that they would remain home-quarantined for 14 days and report any symptom. There is no mechanism to check if any passenger develops any symptom they might not think as important or to alert passengers regarding updates in the Covid-19 guidelines.In Calcutta, no official, be it from the health department or the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, could tell how many such home-quarantined passengers had reported symptoms.Several officials appeared unsure of who could have such information.In Kerala, an incoming passenger cannot overlook or take lightly any Covid-19 symptom. They receive calls daily from the government, at times more than once a day and from various government agencies.A 52-year-old woman who recently reached her hometown in Pathanamthitta district from New Delhi, where she works, said she received calls from the state health department, district collectorate and the local panchayat during her 14-day quarantine that ended on Wednesday.One day, she received two calls — the second to alert her about an update that loss of taste had been notified as a symptom of Covid-19 apart from other symptoms like fever, sore throat, runny nose and breathing distress. “I was pleasantly surprised that they were so methodical. The person called back to tell me that a new symptom of Covid-19 had been accepted in India and that I should look out for loss of taste and smell besides fever, sore throat, or difficulty in breathing,” she said.The experience of a Calcuttan, who lives in Mumbai and reached his Dunlop home on June 6, was different. “I did not receive any call from anyone in the government. I was only made to sign a declaration at the airport that in case I develop any symptom, I will report to the government and that I will remain home-quarantined for 14 days,” the person said.The private company executive said he got to know about the loss of smell or taste as Covid-19 symptoms from the media.Public health professionals said Kerala’s strategy was better in dealing with the pandemic where “communication played a very important role”.Shahid Jameel, the CEO of DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance, said Kerala had done what most Indian states had failed to do. “In the absence of any vaccine, the strategy to limit the infection is to test, trace and isolate. Kerala is tracing people very well and isolating them. It is a matter of how much you want to do, how far you want to go,” he said.Jameel’s organisation works in biomedical, clinical and public health research and is funded by the Centre’s department of biotechnology and the Wellcome Trust of the UK.Repeated calls to a person keeps him/her alert about the symptoms and creates an environment where the person would voluntarily take any symptom seriously and report, another public health professional said.“The government has to create a feeling of trust among people… that I am by your side. It is then that people will engage with the government and report any adverse development,” the public health professional said.Chandrima Bhattacharya, Bengal’s minister of state for health, asked Metro to talk to the director of health services (DHS), when asked about the protocol being followed in the state.Calls to Ajay Chakraborty, the state’s DHS, went unanswered.Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, who are calling home-quarantined mild Covid-19 patients and their contacts, said it was “impossible” to call all passengers reaching the city from other states now that airline and train services had resumed.“Earlier, we used to get the passenger list from the state government. We are no longer getting the list, so the question of calling does not arise. Besides, it is impossible to call tens of thousands of people every day now that so many flights and trains are coming to Calcutta daily,” an official said.In Kerala, the tracking begins from the time someone books a flight ticket. The woman from Pathanamthitta said she had to register with the website, covid19jagratha.kerala.nic.in. Two days before her flight, she got a call asking her if there was anyone in her family in the vulnerable population category and whether she had a home with a room and a toilet only to herself. As her mother is 85-year-old, she was told she could not stay in the same house. She spent her 14-day quarantine in a relative’s place where the facilities were available.“Registering with the website was mandatory to enter Kerala. It gave me a permit without which I would have been sent back from the Trivandrum airport,” she said. “I had to give very minute details like the ward of the gram panchayat where I would be going. I think this enabled the administration to delegate the task of contacting me to the local panchayat and helped decentralise the work,” the woman said.The Dunlop resident, on the other hand, did not need to complete any such registration. He said no one asked for an entry permit when he reached the city airport.Kerala also has the option of delivering food to people in home quarantine, if food cannot be prepared at their place of stay.",2020-06-21 02:34:00
873,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus pandemic fear sees jump in private vehicles around the city - Telegraph India,"The city’s roads have witnessed an almost 30 per cent rise in the number of two-wheelers and private cars in the past 10 days, police said on Saturday.The main reason: people want to avoid public transport for fear of contracting the coronavirus. Earlier, two-wheelers and private cars comprised about 20 per cent of the traffic volume each on major roads, the police said. The number for each has almost doubled during rush hour in the morning and evening.The rise in numbers has also brought to the fore parking problems in some areas.Several officegoers The Telegraph spoke to said they had worked out a monthly deal with parking attendants. “I had to settle for Rs 2,000 a month for parking my car. Otherwise, it was getting difficult to find a place to park my car,” Niladri Chakrabarty, a senior pharma company manager with his office on RN Mukherjee Road, said.Chakrabarty who lives in Kasba said he used to take an auto and the Metro to reach office. “But that was before Covid happened. I can’t risk it anymore. A little extra amount is still fine.”The number of private cars was highest in the first three days of the week in Dalhousie, Esplanade, Shyambazar, and on Rashbehari Avenue and SP Mukherjee Road, the police said.“Between Monday and Wednesday, the number of private cars and two-wheelers arriving at the central business district in Dalhousie was almost 50 per cent of the total number of vehicles on the roads in the area,” a traffic police officer said. “It is same in other parts of the city as well.”Officers from at least three traffic guards along the Bypass said the number of private cars and two-wheelers in the north-south corridor has gone up by almost 35-40 per cent compared to the pre-lockdown days when private cars comprised 20-25 per cent of the traffic volume and two-wheelers around 20 per cent.The bulk of motorists and two-wheeler riders from Garia and Park Circus mostly used the Chingrighata flyover to reach parts of Salt Lake, including Sector V.“Earlier, I used to take a Tata Sumo from Behala to Sector V, along with six others. The shuttle service cost Rs 60,” Dipak Sengupta, a data security expert with an accounting company, said. “Now, I drive down the Parama flyover. I have children and I can’t risk contracting the virus by travelling with others in shuttle vans.”Many private vehicles are reaching the Bypass from BT Road, Lake Town, Jessore Road and VIP Road as well, the police said. Motorists and two-wheeler riders from Sinthee, Chiria More and Dunlop used to travel on buses and shuttle cabs to reach the Bypass. They now use their cars and two-wheelers.If more private vehicles mean fewer pedestrian crossovers on roads, it also means steep parking fees as attendants struggle to accommodate new cars and two-wheelers.Parking lots along Strand Road, Brabourne Road, near India Exchange Place and its adjoining areas in Dalhousie have been witnessing huge rush of cars and two-wheelers over the past week-and-a-half.“I have decided to go for monthly parking fees of Rs 1,800 on RN Mukherjee Road. The daily cost of parking would be Rs 100 otherwise,” Mitali Das, a Sodepur resident who works in a private bank on NS Road, said. “I am not ready to travel by bus or taxi. The parking fee is still a small amount compared to the risk involved in sharing a seat with someone on a private bus.”",2020-06-21 02:35:00
874,Pinak Ghosh,Liquor delivery: state nod to Amazon - Telegraph India,"E-commerce giant Amazon’s India foray into selling liquor on its platform could begin from Bengal if an agreement works out with the West Bengal State Beverages Corporation.Amazon now offers non-alcoholic beverages on its Indian platform whereas the global platform has a separate alcoholic beverages category comprising beer, cocktail mixtures, spirits and wine.Indian online grocery chain Big Basket could be another platform tipplers in the city could tap into for doorstep delivery of liquor.The state beverage corporation in a notice issued on Friday said that four firms — Innovative Retail Concept Private Limited (Big Basket), Golden Goenka Commerce Private Limited, Senrysa Technologies Private Limited (Next Door Hub) and Amazon Seller Services Private Limited — are eligible for empanelment on the state’s list of companies which would be engaged in the electronic retail business of liquor.They have been called for signing memorandums of agreement with the state beverage corporation.Once the agreement is signed, these four will join the existing four firms that have already been empanelled by the state —Spencer’s Retail Limited, Bundle Technologies Private Limited (Swiggy), Hip Bar Private Limited and Zomato Private Limited.Amazon and Big Basket did not revert on the plans for the new venture. City based Golden Goenka Commerce was upbeat about the business opportunity.“We have been an active investor for the past 25 years and seeing a great opportunity in online liquor trading, we decided to expand our horizon and invest in the new venture,” Rajeev Goenka, COO, Golden Goenka Commerce, said.According to industry observers both Amazon and Big Basket have the logistics and infrastructure to support the business. Their entry would encourage competition. It would be beneficial for buyers when it comes to delivery and associated charges.The state excise department in a notification on May 5, 2020, had allowed the provision of telephonic/home delivery of liquor and has subsequently launched an online portal for retail and doorstep delivery of liquor to legal-age consumers.",2020-06-21 03:12:00
875,Our Special Correspondent,Jilted lover shoots dead girl at home in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A 20-year-old college student was shot and stabbed in the neck by her friend while she was asleep at her Regent Park home on Saturday morning, police said.Rakesh Haldar, 26, arrested later in the day on charges of murdering Priyanka Purkait, has claimed the two had been in a relationship for four years and that she wanted to call it off, the police said.Haldar, who is married, was picked up around 2.45pm from Chandi Ghosh Road not far from Purkait’s home. He has been booked under the arms act as well.He has apparently told cops he made the gun by watching a “gun-making video” on the Net and that he committed the crime in a fit of rage.Purkait, who lived with her mother and aunt, was asleep in their single-storey home in Anandapally in the Regent Park police station area when Haldar struck around 8am, the police said.Her mother, who works as a help, had stepped out of home around 7.50am while her aunt was doing some work just outside the home when Haldar barged in.“After barging into the house, Haldar, a resident of Panchanantala, did not waste any time and opened fire,” an officer of Regent Park police station said.Preliminary investigations suggested the bullet hit her in the neck. Haldar stabbed her multiple times in the neck to ensure she died, the officer said.Haldar, a driver by profession, fled the spot on a cycle before anyone in the neighbourhood could react. Purkait’s aunt, who apparently saw Haldar rush out, was the first to raise the alarm, the police said.Purkait, a third-year arts student at Women’s Christian College, was taken to Baghajatin State General Hospital where she was declared dead.The body has been sent for post-mortem.“It is very unfortunate. She attended her classes regularly,” Ajanta Pal, the principal of her college, said.Cops seized a single-shot from a nearby canal where Haldar said he had disposed of the weapon. The knife is still to be found, the police said.Haldar has claimed he was into a relationship with Purkait from 2016, a year before his marriage, an officer of the homicide department said. He has claimed they lost touch but recently reconnected.",2020-06-21 03:13:00
876,Subhajoy Roy,Approved building plan validity extension - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will extend the validity of the existing approved building plans by a year, Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the corporation’s board of administrators, said on Saturday.Hakim was speaking to members of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce where he made the announcement. He said he had spoken to the chief minister to transfer the thika tenancy department of the government to the civic body. The civic body will start issuing approved building plans within 15 days from July 1, he said.Approved building plans issued by the CMC are now valid for a five years, on expiry of which the plans have to be renewed by paying a fee.Work on several real estate projects as well as individuals homes had to be put on hold because of the lockdown. Masons who went back to their hometowns are still to return to the city as suburban trains haven’t resumed services.It is in this backdrop that Hakim announced extending the validity of the existing plans by a year. “We will extend the building plans’ term by a year. I will ask all other municipalities to do the same thing,” Hakim, who is the municipal affairs minister as well, said.Hakim said the CMC would start issuing approved building plans within 15 days from July 1. The 15-day deadline was supposed to come into force from April but could not be implemented because of the lockdown. “We will begin doing it from July 1,” he said on Saturday.The CMC had decided to make it mandatory to apply for a building permit online from April 1 and convey its decision about the proposed building within 15 days. The proposal will be cleared or rejected (with reason) within 15 days.Thika tenancy“I have spoken to the chief minister on the issue of thika tenancy. I know that the land department is taking a lot of time in dealing with cases of thika tenancy. So, I have requested the CM to transfer the thika tenancy matter to the CMC,” Hakim said. “I think some policy decisions will be made in a few months. If needed, the act has to be amended.”The Bengal government has removed the restriction on the maximum height of buildings on thika tenancy and made thika tenants eligible for long-term lease of the land.The change has been brought about through an amendment to the West Bengal thika tenancy (acquisition and regulation) act in an apparent effort to make the city slum-free.The act will now make thika tenants eligible to secure bank loans to develop five-storey (G+4) buildings on thika plots.Land ceilingHakim acknowledged that the urban land ceiling act had lost its relevance and there was no need for it in today’s world.“I also agree that there is no relevance today. There is no need for it. But we have got it traditionally from the CPM government. The mindset is that rich people are grabbing land; so, we need the act to protect the poor,” he said.An individual can hold up to 7.5 cottahs of land under the act in the urban areas of Bengal. Builders have long been asking it to be repealed.Vivek Gupta, president of the chamber, said that builders acted as intermediaries. They buy the land, build on it and then transfer it to the actual end users, who would typically hold much less than 7.5 cottahs.The chamber should give concrete suggestion for the government, the minister said. “We will discuss it in the ministry and can talk to the land secretary; after that it can go to the cabinet as a proposal,” Hakim said.“It only adds to the cost and complicates matters. If repealed, realty will get a boost,” Sushil Mohta, chairman of Credai Bengal, said.",2020-06-21 03:16:00

We will hold a meeting soon,” she said.Chakraborty said the civic body wants to ensure that everyone who enters a market sanitises or washes his/her hands.A pilot run will take place on Sunday to find out problems, if any.Most markets in Salt Lake are oval shaped and have multiple entry and exit points.A civic official said they had initially asked the shopkeepers to keep hand sanitisers and ask customers to use them before handling money.“It did not work out as the traders were not willing to bear the cost of sanitisers,” said the official.Many residents feel that this might result in overcrowding near the gates.DuttabadA 21-year-old woman, who stays in Duttabad, tested positive for Covid-19 late on Friday.

879,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: JU divided over final assessment for science - Telegraph India,"Teachers and officials of Jadavpur University are divided over how to assess final-semester science students.The teachers want the average of at least three best semester performances to be counted while giving the weightage of previous semesters.The officials want to give the weightage of the best semester performance in the same manner it has been done in the engineering and arts faculties.The university had on June 12 announced the mode of assessment for arts and engineering.It has convened a meeting of the exam board next week to work out the mode of assessment for science, a university official said.The university had announced that performance in previous semesters and internal assessments of the current semester would be factored in to assess final-year students across the three faculties, but the difference surfaced over unifor-mity in fixing the parameters.The faculty council of science moved a resolution on June 2 that says: “Fifty percentage weightage will be given on the performance of the previous semesters to prepare the result of the final semesters. This will be calculated as follows: for undergraduate: average percentage of aggregate marks of the best three semesters. For postgraduate: average percentage of aggregate marks of the best three semesters.”“If you consider the performance of at least three semesters, it reflects whether the student has been a constant performer. But if the university takes only the best aggregate, it can help a student, but it does not show whether a student has been constant,” a teacher of the mathematics department said.Some teachers have cited “consistency”; they are in favour of an average percentage of aggregate marks of the previous five semesters at the undergraduate level, another teacher said.“The teachers have explained to the university their rationale. Let the exam board meet next week and take the final call. We have to go by what the board decides because the evaluation has to be completed soon,” Partha Pratim Roy, a teacher of the physics department, said.The Telegraph had on June 14 reported that for engineering students, 30 per cent of the assessment would be based on the best aggregate marks of all the past semesters and 70 per cent on home assignments or any other assignment done through the distance mode.For arts students, one of the two options is basing 60 per cent of the assessment on the best aggregate marks of all the past semesters.“While helping students get the best grades, the uni-versity should not forget they need to assess a candi-date based on merit even under these trying circumstances,” a chemistry teacher said.",2020-06-21 03:19:00
880,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: PPE rates capped at fair price shops - Telegraph India,"The state government has fixed the price of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks that doctors can buy from fair price medicine shops in government hospitals.The government has also fixed the number of masks or PPE — standard protective shield against Covid-19 — a doctor can buy at a time from a fair price medicine shop.A PPE, inclusive of all gear, will cost between Rs 430 and Rs 460 if one buys from a fair price medicine shop. A reusable double-layered poplin mask will cost Rs 17 and a three-ply surgical disposable mask will cost Rs 4. These prices are inclusive of taxes, said a notification issued by the state health department.Doctors can buy masks and PPE by placing a requisition on paper used for writing prescriptions or by mentioning their registration numbers.The notification says a doctor can buy 10 PPE kits and 25 double-layered poplin masks and three-ply surgical masks at a time. But it was not clear whether a doctor will get 25 poplin and surgical masks each or together.It was also not mentioned in the notification how frequently a doctor will be allowed to buy the safety gear.At a meeting with chief minister Mamata Banerjee last week, some doctors had raised the issue that private practitioners were having to buy masks and PPE at a very high rate. Most of them are passing on the burden to patients by increasing the consultation fee.A doctor present at the meeting said they had requested the chief minister to make available PPE and masks at a lower rate for private practitioners. “It is good that the government has issued a notification fixing the prices. We had raised the matter at a meeting with the chief minister last week. Many doctors who run private clinics were complaining that they had to buy PPE and masks at a high rate,” said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, a doctor at the hospital for infectious diseases in Beleghata.The Telegraph had on Saturday reported that the state government intended to cap the price a patient admitted to a private hospital has to pay for the PPE and the number of kits for which he or she can be billed.“It is now common knowledge that PPE kits are available within a range of Rs 300 to Rs 800. MRP tag has no consequences. Please keep it in mind while billing the patients,” retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, had stated in a voice message posted on a closed WhatsApp group. Private hospitals are members of the group.Samudra Basu, a doctor at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, a dedicated Covid treatment facility, said a full PPE includes a head cover, a hood, a jump suit or gown with full sleeves, two pairs of gloves, two pairs of disposable goggles and a foot cover.",2020-06-22 01:22:00
881,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: Help for College Street booksellers’ families  - Telegraph India,"Former and present students of Presidency University on Sunday distributed ration among 100-odd families of booksellers and book binders of the College Street area who have been hit by the lockdown and Cyclone Amphan.The current and former students of the College Street institution are associated with the Quarantined Students Youth Network, a charitable platform.They were joined by members of the Boipara Banchao Mancha in the distribution of essentials at an event organised at the gate of Indian Coffee House on Bankim Chatterjee Street.Each beneficiary family was given 3kg rice, 2kg potato, 500g pulse, 250g of soybean, salt, spices, biscuits, vitamin tablets and sanitary napkins.Sayan Chakravarty, a second-year postgraduate student at Presidency, said small-time booksellers and binders and van-drivers who supply books to the stores have been hit hard by the twin blows of lockdown and the cyclone.“Having frequented the area over the years, I know big and medium-sized publishing houses have the resources to sustain the loss. But these small-time traders are in a bad state,” said Chakravarty, a student of economics.Another student said the plight of the persons they interacted with frequently prompted them to think of the initiative.The Boipara Banchao Mancha, a platform of book publishers and book sellers that was set up last month, provided details of the affected families to members of the Quarantined Students Youth Network.Shyamal Dhar, of the Mancha, said they, too, had raised resources to help these families. Members of the forum visited areas in and around College Street on Friday to distribute coupons among the affected families.“It is a matter of pride that the students have come forward to help these families with their limited means,” said Dhar.The Quarantined Student Youth Network, whose members include students of other institutes as well, has been running a community kitchen in the College Street since April. The community kitchen is one of the 17 such initiatives being run across the state.",2020-06-22 01:32:00
882,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: No-exam decision to cover entire NIT  - Telegraph India,"NIT Durgapur has announced that end-term exams would not be held for the first, second and third-year BTech students because of the Covid-19 pandemic and they would be judged by their class performance and marks in previous exams.The institute had earlier announced a similar evaluation system for the fourth-year graduating students.“There is no certainty on when the campus will reopen and a large number of students do not have internet connection at home, without which online assessment cannot be done. So, the institute is going for this mode of assessment,” said an official of the Durgapur institute.Details of the assessment were mentioned in a notification issued on June 19.The notification says assessment for theory papers of the second and third year students students will be done by giving 60 per cent weightage on the “previous performance”.It said 25 per cent weightage would be given on the performance of the mid-term examinations of the current semester.According to an official of the institute, 15 per cent weightage would be given on continuous assessment of performance before the lockdown.Since first-year students have attended just one semester, they will be evaluated for their theory papers on the basis of 60 per cent weightage on mid-term performance.The official said 25 per cent weightage would be given on the first semester grade point average and the rest on continuous assessment of performance before the lockdown.NIT director Anupam Basu told The Telegraph: “We have evolved the mechanism to do away with the uncertainty and anxiety of the students and the guardians.... The mechanism takes into account the past performance and the ‘till date’ performance of the students. Special care has been taken to ensure that the students are not adversely affected”.The institute had in April carried out a survey on Net access among students. After going through the students’ feedback, the authorities realised that 45-50 per cent of its BTech and postgraduate students either did not have a computer or live in places with poor Net connectivity.Basu, a professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Kharagpur who is on lien to helm the Durgapur institute, had flagged his concern over last-mile connectivity and the resultant digital divide coming in the way of online classes in an article he had written for Metro on April 10.The notice issued by the dean (academic) at NIT Durgapur says: “If a student is not satisfied with the results thus calculated, he may exercise the option of foregoing the results and appear for regular method of examination, which may be held only after the pandemic situation normalises. In such a situation, the student has to appear in all the theory subjects in that semester on reopening of the institute and the result thus obtained will replace the earlier one with no option of reverting back.”",2020-06-22 01:33:00
883,Kinsuk Basu,Medicine sales across Kolkata fall during Coronavirus lockdown  - Telegraph India,"Medicine stores and wholesalers across Calcutta have reported a drop in sales since the Covid-related lockdown was imposed and doctors are partly attributing the trend to healthy habits and social distancing, which have reduced everyday ailments.The sale of some common medicines has gone down by between 25 and 30 per cent. The drop has been as high as 80 per cent for certain drugs, including ones to treat infertility, according to the stores and wholesalers.Besides, many people had stocked their medicines for chronic ailments like blood pressure and diabetes during the lockdown, apprehending there might be a crisis later.The owners of some standalone medicine stores in several neighbourhoods of Calcutta said as Covid-19 started spreading, many people stocked paracetamol, a common medicine for fever.“Because of Covid-19 and the lockdown, people have been maintaining social distancing. Schools are closed, many people are avoiding going to offices and are working from home. Chances of infection have come down. I barely had patients with influenza in the last couple of months,” said physician Amitabha Saha.“Children mostly contract common cold and flu from school or playground. As for adults, they get infected at workplaces and on public transport,” he said.Wearing masks has also helped prevent the spread of common cold to a great extent, he said.During the lockdown, Saha said, the level of air pollution had gone down, much to the relief of people with lung ailments such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.Doctors also attributed the drop in medicine sale to the new cleanliness habits that most have been forced to adopt to fight the pandemic.“With frequent washing of hands, chances of gastroenteric diseases are bound to go down. Similarly, masks reduce chances of acquiring respiratory infections through droplets or air-borne microbes,” said internal medicine specialist Sujoy Mukherjee.Yet another reason for the drop is that far fewer people are visiting hospitals because they are scared of getting infected by the coronavirus or doctors have not yet started seeing patients. So, the number of prescriptions has come down.“I have decided not to step out to even visit my doctor. If I have some problem, I call up my doctor and follow his advice,” said Apurba Jana, a Kasba resident and a patient of bronchial asthma. “ But I must say I have been keeping fine for a while.”The owner of a medicine store in south Calcutta said sale of antibiotics have gone down. The antibiotics include amoxicillin (for common infections and chest congestions), azithromycin (used largely for respiratory tract infections) and norfloxacin (for gastroenteric disorders), which are often sold without prescriptions, as well as expensive antibiotics that are sold only against prescriptions.The owner said he would sell 12 to 15 strips of such expensive antibiotics daily before the lockdown was imposed. Now, the sale has come down to barely one or two a day.One wholesaler said sale of chemotherapy drugs for cancer and infertility drugs have gone down.“Many people who were detected with cancer just before the lockdown are deferring their visits to the hospitals. Also, because a large number of doctors treating infertility are not seeing patients for safety reasons, the sale of those drugs have dropped,” said Kajal Gomes of Adeline Pharma, a wholesaler in Calcutta.One medicine store owner in Kasba said many of his regular customers had bought strips of paracetamol when Covid-19 started spreading. “Many of them said buying the medicine later would raise suspicion among neighbours,” he said.“What made matters even worse was Amphan, which severely hit distribution,” said B.B. Singh, depot manager of Cipla, a drug manufacturer.The drop in sale of medicines has been pronounced in two wholesale hubs, Bagree Market and Mehta Building, where traders said their sales had dropped by 50 per cent. “Many doctors are yet to resume seeing patients and prescriptions are not being generated in large numbers,” said Sankha Roy Chowdhury, the president of Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association.",2020-06-22 02:12:00
885,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Online hole on birth & death certificates - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has resumed issuing birth and death certificates, a service that was suspended during the lockdown, but the promised service to accept applications online is yet to roll out.In the absence of an online facility to submit applications, many people are not being able to apply for certificates out of fear that they might be infected by the coronavirus in the crowded offices of the civic body.Civic officials, too, are fearing the same following the easing of the lockdown norms.Before the lockdown was imposed, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) used to accept only 100 applications for birth certificate and as many for death certificate at its headquarters on SN Banerjee Road every day.People used to turn up early in the morning to ensure they were among the first 100 applicants. The room where applications were submitted remained crammed with people.The scene was not very different in the borough offices either. The fear of being sucked into a large gathering has kept many people away from civic offices. Sugata Sengupta, who is yet to apply for the birth certificate for his 15-month-old son, said he would wait a few more months before visiting a CMC office.But he is afraid that if things do not improve, he would have to take the risk of visiting a civic office.“I would have benefited greatly if they had started accepting applications online. In that case, I could have submitted all necessary documents online,” said Sengupta, whose son was born at a private hospital off EM Bypass in Anandapur.The Telegraph had in March reported that the CMC planned to start accepting online applications from April but it could not happen because of the lockdown.Now that the civic body has resumed issuing birth and death certificates, the need for accepting applications online is being felt more than ever.Atin Ghosh, a member of CMC’s board of administrators, said they would ask people to drop their applications in boxes if there were long queues. “We are getting very few applications. But if the number surges, we will keep drop boxes,” he said.",2020-06-22 02:15:00
886,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus pandemic: Door-to-door tax appeal in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Councillors and civic officials in Salt Lake are conducting door-to-door visits to deliver property tax bills. The residents are also being requested to pay the tax soon.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation board had held a meeting last week and decided to visit homes and businesses with the request to pay property tax because the lockdown had led to the civic coffers drying up.An official said an “aggressive” promotional campaign for online payment would be launched because most residents were avoiding queues.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s property tax collection in April-May came down by over 85 per cent compared with the same period last year.“We are in a serious fund crunch. All ward offices have been asked to actively collect property tax in Salt Lake,” Debashis Jana, a mayoral council member of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said.An official said only 10 per cent of the township’s taxpayers pay property tax online. This could be because Salt Lake has a sizeable population of senior citizens, many of whom are not comfortable making payments online.A councillor said: “In my ward alone, the amount of outstanding property tax is more than Rs 12 crore.”",2020-06-22 02:16:00
887,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus pandemic: Virtual tour replaces parents’ class ritual - Telegraph India,"Several reputable schools have abandoned an age-old practice parents look forward to: their first meeting with the teachers after their child’s entry into a school.The interactive session has gone virtual.The visit to the school, sitting in the classroom and meeting the teachers have been replaced by a presentation and sometimes a virtual tour of the campus that schools have prepared to give parents an introduction to what is expected of them and what schools do.Institutions like Modern High School for Girls, South Point School and Mahadevi Birla World Academy conducted an orientation programme with parents online for the first time this year.Modern High School for Girls has been having the orientation event for 15 years, South Point for 10 years and Mahadevi Birla World Academy for at least eight years.Institutions like La Martiniere for Girls and St James’ School have had the interactions for close to two decades.La Martiniere might hold an online interaction this time and St James’ plans to call parents in small groups whenever children are ready to go to school.Many feel virtual introduction lacks the “personal touch and is more distant”, a teacher said.“One learns from the body language when a person is in front of you, unlike in an online interaction where parents had to keep the audio on mute or videos off because of network issues. But the pandemic has put us in a situation where we are reinventing and it is the second best option we are making use of,” said Krishna Damani, trustee of South Point.Unlike previous years when teachers tell parents that they have to limit the screen time of their children, this year the interaction began on virtual note and will continue “over the screen between teachers and children” for some time now.“An online orientation is not the same and it is an experience to look out at the garden or the field in the school and meet the teachers. It is a huge thing for parents to be able to see the child’s classroom.... But we have to make the best of a situation and have many things to learn from it,” said Devi Kar, the director of Modern High.“It’s one thing to go as a parent and another as an applicant. The latter was a shorter stint and I would have preferred to see the campus and get a feel of the place where my daughter will spend the next 13 years,” said K. Mitra, the mother of a three year old.“New parents want to spend time in the school and some of them are also observant of the safety and security measures.... It is also the duty of the institution to keep those in the best form and shape,” said Nupur Ghosh, vice-principal, Mahadevi Birla World Academy.Rupkatha Sarkar, the principal of La Martiniere for Girls said: “Face-to-face interaction is more desirable. But if is not possible, we may have to interact online.”",2020-06-22 02:18:00
888,Debraj Mitra,Solar spectacle sabotaged - Telegraph India,"The partial solar eclipse that Calcutta was tipped to see was sabotaged by clouds and intermittent showers in most places.The morning was promising. The sun was out, triggering hopes of a decent viewing and sky lovers took to roofs and balconies with telescopes, X-ray plates and special glasses.In a few pockets of the city, people could see the moon blocking a slice off the sun in the first phase of the spectacle. But the sky started changing colours as the day progressed and before noon, clouds blocked the view at most parts of the city. In some areas, the no-show was accompanied by a persistent drizzle.When the sky started clearing up, it was too late.The slot for the annular solar eclipse in Calcutta was from 10.46am to 2.17pm, with the maximum eclipse tipped to be visible around 12.35pm.An annular solar eclipse occurs when the disc of the moon covers the central portion of the sun leaving only a ring-like peripheral region, called the “ring of fire”, visible.This was the second time on the trot when Calcuttans were deprived of a partial view of the spectacle because of the clouds, after a similar damp squib on December 26. Last year’s eclipse was prominently visible from a stretch of southern India.This year, places like Haryana and Uttarakhand were tipped to the best spots to see the spectacle.“The partial eclipse started in Calcutta around 10.46am. The sun was visible but there was a light veil of clouds most of the times. Between 11am and 11.45am, the sun and the clouds were playing hide and seek and one could intermittently get glimpses of the eclipse in progress. But after that, it started drizzling. Though the rain stopped after some time, the sky remained overcast,” said Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academic), MP Birla Planetarium, who tried watching the eclipse from his Salt Lake home.A Behala resident said he saw the moon blocking a slice of the sun from 11.30am to 11.50am. A Kasba resident was not as lucky. “The sky was overcast for most of the time. It was raining intermittently,” he said.Residents of Salt Lake, Beleghata and Phoolbagan also flocked to see the solar eclipse from rooftops and parks.At least 50 residents of Salt Lake who had gathered in IA park to catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse had to run for cover inside the community centre nearby as it had started raining.Volunteers of the Paschim Banga Vigyan Mancha went to the park armed with special glasses and solar eclipse viewing cards that have a small solar filter in the middle and gave it to those who had gathered to watch the eclipse. But the weather played spoilsport.Scientists and staff at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum had a different story to tell. The Covid-19 curbs had forced shut the museum for students and astronomy enthusiasts. The BITM administration had organised a webcast of the spectacle, as viewed from a Celestron 4 inch refractor telescope.“When the clouds appeared and rain started, we thought the arrangement would be in vain. But shortly after 12.30pm, the sky cleared and the sun came out. We got a good view and the live feed from the telescope was shared from our YouTube channel. The webcast was viewed by close to 14,000 people,” said an official.",2020-06-22 02:46:00
889,Monalisa Chaudhuri,CA accused of multi-city murder run - Telegraph India,"A 42-year-old chartered accountant allegedly shot his mother-in-law dead and then himself at his in-laws’ flat in Kankurgachhi on Monday evening, hours after killing his estranged wife in Bangalore and taking a flight to Calcutta.Police in Calcutta found a purported suicide note in the Kankurgachhi apartment and came to suspect that Amit Agarwal had killed his wife earlier in the day. Following an alert from Calcutta, police in Bangalore’s Whitefield tracked down the address of Agarwal’s wife, Shipi, and went to her home, only to find her dead.Till late on Monday, the cops could not ascertain how she was killed.In Calcutta, Amit’s 70-year-old father-in-law, Subhas Dhandhania, ran out of the apartment on seeing wife Lalita being shot and bolted the door from outside. The elderly man then alerted Phoolbagan police.When a police team reached the apartment, in Rameshwaram Building on RK Samadhi Road, they found the old woman and her son-in-law dead. The purported suicide note was near Agarwal’s body.The sleuths have seized a gun, the suspected murder weapon, from the flat.Agarwal turned up at his in-laws’ flat - 2B, Block B - around 5.30pm.“A preliminary investigation suggests Amit Agarwal had gone to his in-laws’ residence, where he lost his calm over his divorce case. His mother-in-law tried to pacify him but he took out his gun and shot her. His father-in-law saw the murder, fled the house and latched the door from outside,” said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.In Bangalore, deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) M.N. Anuchet told The Telegraph: “We rushed to the apartment complex soon after we received information from Calcutta police.”The apartment complex is in Mahadevpura, a Bangalore suburb near Whitefield.“She had been dead by the time we broke open the door. She was in a sitting position on a couch in the living room, right next to a cupboard,” he said. The cause of the death could not be confirmed immediately.Calcutta police said Agarwal and Shilpi are survived by a 10-year-old son.Agarwal was living in Uttarpara in Hooghly, while Shilpi had moved out after a divorce case was filed and shifted to Bangalore with their son, an officer said.“Agarwal had recently gone to Bangalore to meet his son. After killing his wife, he took a flight to Calcutta with his son. He dropped his son at his Uttarpara home before heading for Kankurgachhi,” the officer said.“It is apparent Agarwal had gone to Bangalore with the intention to kill his wife. The suicide note indicates that he had gone to Kankurgachhi to kill both his in-laws.”The bodies will be sent for post-mortem on Tuesday.Shilpi’s body will undergo post-mortem in Bangalore.Investigation is on to find more details about her and whether she worked in the city, Bangalore police said on Monday night.",2020-06-23 02:26:00
890,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Junior doctors: Resume non-Covid service - Telegraph India,"Junior doctors at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital have demanded resumption of treatment of non-Covid patients at the hospital because many such patients are facing problems in getting treatment at other hospitals.Doctors at the College Street hospital, now a dedicated Covid-19 treatment centre, said regular follow-up is an important part of treating patients suffering from chronic ailments.A junior doctor at the hospital said he knew of at least two patients who had died after losing touch with their doctors during the lockdown. One was diagnosed with lung cancer and was supposed to undergo surgery and the other was suffering from a chronic kidney disease.Hundreds of patients who used to undergo radiotherapy for cancer, were under obstetric care or were being treated for leukaemia, cardiac ailments and tuberculosis are being inconvenienced, said the doctors, explaining the rationale behind the demand for resumption of treatment of non-Covid ailments.“The government is asking these patients to visit other medical colleges, but all medical colleges were already overburdened when the lockdown was announced. The addition has only stretched their resources and increased the waiting time for patients,” said a doctor.After receiving several such calls from patients and hearing about their plight, several doctors of Calcutta Medical College approached the authorities with their demand. They also met the director of medical education, Debasish Bhattacharya, at Swasthya Bhavan and conveyed their stand to him.“We have approached the director of medical education and requested him to allow non-Covid services to resume at our hospital soon. We have handed him a copy of our demand. We cannot let patients with other ailments suffer because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said one doctor.“We are yet to hear from the director of medical education.”Bhattacharya could not be reached for comment.The Calcutta Medical College and Hospital was converted into a designated Covid hospital in early May. Outpatient departments in the hospital have been shut since May 11.The junior doctors listed instances to explain how serious the problem is. “A 55-year-old man from North 24-Parganas, who was a stage 1 chronic kidney patient, was being treated at the hospital. He was without medication for about two months as he could not come to our hospital because we were not treating any non-Covid patient. He subsequently died,” said a doctor.“The patient was on anti-diabetes medicines. Patients like him used to get free supply of insulin from our hospital. There are many poor people who cannot afford to buy insulin.”Another junior doctor cited the example of patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that needs regular medicines to keep a self-destructive antibody suppressed.Missing medication may affect multiple organs. “SLE patients are given a medicine called mycophenolate, which costs Rs 3,000 in the market. They get it for free at our hospital. We have a pool of about 200 SLE patients in our hospital, who come to our OPD for treatment. Besides, we used to get about 20 new patients every month. All of them are in trouble now,” said one junior doctor.",2020-06-23 02:42:00
891,Jhinuk Mazumdar,90% don’t seek help for depression; stigma cited - Telegraph India,"People with depression do not seek help because of the stigma attached to it and the belief they will recover on their own, doctors, psychotherapists and counsellors said on Sunday at a session on depression.“According to the national mental health survey of 2016-17, about 90 per cent people in Bengal do not seek help… we found that out during a door-to-door survey,” psychiatrist Rajarshi Neogi, an assistant professor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said.“The treatment gap in India is 85.2 per cent. This means that only about 10 per cent or a little more of all patients suffering from depression receive some sort of treatment.”Neogi, who was part of the surveying team, said it was commissioned by the health ministry in collaboration with the state government.The session titled “It is okay not to be okay” was organised by Caring Minds, a psychological wellness centre, on Sunday afternoon.“Depression is ignored because many people think it will go away on its own. They do not seek help because of the stigma of reaching out to a mental health professional openly,” Minu Budhia, psychotherapist and founder and director of Caring Minds, said. “There is some improvement in the number of people seeking help now and some of them are doing self referrals but it is still a long way to go.”The panellists discussed postpartum depression that many women go through after childbirth and families fail to recognise it and often brush it under the carpet. Many families relate it to staying awake at night or giving birth to a girl child.Besides postpartum depression there are many women aged between 40 and 50 who suffer from depression after their children leave home, Budhia said “Mothers get so involved with their children as they grow up that over the years they forget their own likes and dislikes; they get conditioned to keep aside their own preferences,” Budhia said. “Their life revolves around their children and depression sets in when their children leave home for studies or get married.”The refusal to seek help stems from the fear that they might become dependent on medicines, Neogi said.There is “a care gap” because there aren’t enough mental health professionals, he said. “General physicians or gynaecologists should have some training to identify symptoms of depression so that they can help patients with minimal symptoms to tide over it.”Psychologist Megha Rathi spoke about the need to talk to people who show signs of depression and not leave them on their own. Parents need to create a “stress-free and friendly environment for children at home” by having at least one meal together, Rathi said.A person with depression will feel sad for most part of the day and have feelings of hopelessness and helplessness apart from losing appetite or complaining of aches in the body. “If these symptoms continue for two to three weeks they should seek help,” Preeyam Budhia, head, New Initiatives, Caring Minds, said.Timely treatment is important. If left untreated, it can trigger suicide attempts, Budhia said. “Hence, the caregiver or the family has to be alert.”",2020-06-23 03:29:00
892,Snehal Sengupta,Saved at airport: birds as costly as BMW 3 - Telegraph India,"A Hyacinth macaw, 11 Hahn’s macaws, nine Severe macaws and one Pesquet’s Parrot, which were on their way to Bangalore, were rescued from the airport on Sunday.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau seized the birds in a joint operation and arrested two men in their late 20s the moment they stepped inside, a DRI official said.The 22 macaws crammed inside small cages were headed to a receiver in Bangalore, the official said.They had been smuggled in from Bangladesh, which is a popular transit point for wildlife smugglers bringing in birds and animals from Africa and South America as well as Southeast Asian countries via Myanmar.The Hyacinth macaw is brilliant blue in colour and is the largest macaw species that is native to South America. A pair costs upwards of Rs 40 lakh — a little less than a BMW 3 Series — in the exotic bird market, a forest official said. These birds cannot fly.Pesquet’s parrot is found in New Guinea and commands a price tag of close to Rs 10 lakh while the Hahn’s macaw and Severe macaw, too, are priced “quite high”, the official said.Forest department officials failed to remember the last time they had seized a Hyacinth Macaw.The bureau had received information that a consignment of exotic macaws had been smuggled into the city from Bangladesh through the Bongaon border, an official said.“We had information that they would be sent to Bangalore and we shared the information with the DRI… we caught them in a joint operation,” the official said.The men who were arrested have been identified as Kamalesh Saha and Shayan Acharya.These birds are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora with the Hyacinth macaw being accorded the highest protection.Birder Bapai Sen, who is a member of the All Bengal Birds Lover Organisation that organises bird fairs across the city, said there was a demand for these birds as pets. “Macaws are native to Central America, Mexico and South America and make excellent pets.”Endangered animals and exotic birds are smuggled because they have a ready market among the affluent who like to build “mini zoos” in farmhouses on the outskirts of cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune and Ahmedabad, a forest official said.All the birds have been handed over to the Alipore zoo hospital for quarantine. Ashis Kumar Samanta, the director of the zoo, said the birds had been checked by doctors and were “healthy but traumatised”.",2020-06-23 03:36:00
893,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Fewer Covid-19 patients turn critical - Telegraph India,"The percentage of Covid-19 patients turning critical after being admitted to hospital has gone down over the past month, conversa-tions with doctors at some of Calcutta’s private hospitals suggest.Officials of some private laboratories and hospitals where the test for the disease is being conducted said the average viral load in patients testing positive was less compared with the average load a month ago.People reporting illness early, doctors gaining experience in Covid treatment and use of some anti-viral drugs could be the reasons for the drop in the number of patients turning critical and in the average viral load of those testing positive, said doctors across hospitals.Peerless Hospital had eight Covid-19 patients a month back, of whom four were in critical condition and in need of ventilator. On Tuesday, the hospital had 41 Covid-19 patients but only two were critical, said hospital officials.AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake, a designated Covid-19 treatment centre, has 25 beds in its critical care and high dependency units, which are reserved for patients with severe symptoms.“About a month back, all critical care and high dependency unit beds were full. General beds were vacant. Now, about five critical care beds are vacant but all 40 general beds are occupied,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI.Medica Superspecialty Hospital on Tuesday had 82 Covid patients, around half of whom were in need of critical care. “About a month back, most patients admitted in our hospital had severe symptoms, requiring critical care,” said Aviral Roy, senior consultant, critical care, Medica.The Telegraph reported on Tuesday that the recovery rate of Covid patients in Bengal on Monday was 60.5 per cent, an improvement of 13 per cent over the past week. On Tuesday, the rate increased to 62.58 per cent. “Today, 370 cases were detected and 531 were discharged,” a health department official said.“Fewer patients with moderate symptoms such as respiratory distress are now developing severe symptoms like organ failure,” said critical care specialist Ajoy Krishna Sarkar. Early reporting by patients, he said, could be one reason for the trend.“In the initial stages of the outbreak, most people were scared to go for a test even if they had symptoms. Also, there were fewer testing facilities. Back then, the disease had already progressed to a critical stage in many patients by the time they were brought to hospital,” Sarkar said.He said for many patients with moderate symptoms, supportive treatment is effective. Providing oxygen support at the right moment, giving anti-coagulant drugs to prevent blood clot, a common complication in Covid-19, were some of the treatments that are helping patients.“Initially, the fear of getting stigmatised was preventing many from getting tested. Now, with time, people have become aware and with easy availability of testing, we are getting many asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients,” said Sumit Sengupta, senior consultant for respiratory medicine, who has treated more than 200 Covid patients at AMRI Salt Lake.He said doctors, too, have gained experience over the past few months in management of the disease. “Earlier, we were not confident about using some drugs and protocols. There was reluctance in using non-invasive ventilation, which is now being used,” said Sengupta.A WhatsApp group of doctors treating Covid patients in India, Australia, Singapore and the US and the UK has been formed, where the members are sharing their experiences in treating the coronavirus disease.“The doctors are treating Covid patients at different levels. Some are in primary care, while others in critical care. Everyone is sharing documents and experiences. That has helped,” he said.",2020-06-24 02:35:00
894,Our Legal Correspondent  ,Coronavirus pandemic: CBSE exam decision by Wednesday evening: Centre to SC - Telegraph India,"The Centre on Tuesday assured the Supreme Court that a final decision on postponement of Class X and XII exams of CBSE would be taken by Wednesday evening, amid concerns among parents over conducting the tests during the Covid pandemic.CBSE is to conduct the pending Class X and XII tests from July 1 across the country. The decision has raised hackles of parents, who fear their children might be infected by the coronavirus if they step out to write the papers.The number of Covid cases in the country touched 4.4 lakh on Tuesday.Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBSE, told a bench headed by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar that the “decision-making process and discussions” on the exams were at “an advanced stage” and a “decision would be taken by tomorrow evening”.Hence, he urged the court to adjourn the hearing till Thursday, so the government could communicate its final decision to the court during the next hearing.Appearing for the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which conducts the ISC (Class XII) and ICSE (Class X) exams, senior counsel Jaideep Gupta submitted that it might broadly follow the government’s decision on CBSE.Mehta told the court the government could not compel CISCE to be bound by its decision on exams as it was an autonomous body. The council, he said, has “to voluntarily bind itself” to any decision on CBSE. The court said the council was at liberty to take an “informed decision” on the issue.Mehta said “the government understands the anxiety of students and parents”.The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, was hearing a batch of petitions filed by students and parents seeking quashing of CBSE’s notification on resumption of Class X and Class XII exams on July 1. Some ICSE students, too, wanted postponement of the exams.Parents aver that holding the exams now might expose the students to the threat of contracting Covid-19.Advocate Rishi Malhotra, appearing for some petitioners, insisted that the matter be taken up on Thursday as students and parents were anxious about the outcome.Around 50 papers in Class X and XII exams are pending as CBSE had suspended the tests in March because of the Covid outbreak. Later, it declared that tests in 29 main papers would be held in July.CBSE is supposed to hold exams for six papers of Class X in North-East Delhi, which witnessed communal violence.",2020-06-24 02:38:00
895,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus pandemic: Mask-less face police van ride in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A middle-aged man stepping out of an insurance office and a motorcyclist with a person on the pillion were among those police prosecuted on CR Avenue on Tuesday for having their faces uncovered.In the afternoon, a team of cops — some in plain clothes — near E Mall stopped anyone who had not covered their faces, the police said.The offenders were asked to board a police van. The van left for Bowbazar police station the moment it was full. “They were allowed to go after a warning and a fine,” an officer said.The drill was repeated once while The Telegraph was there.Cops conducted similar drives at multiple places in the city, an officer in Lalbazar said.Several motorists have been prosecuted in the past few days for not wearing masks, a traffic police officer said.“As most establishments have opened, we are not prosecuting motorists for being out on the roads any more. But the drive against people stepping out of homes without masks is on,” the officer in Lalbazar said.On Tuesday, cops stopped the middle-aged man when he stepped out of an office of the Life Insurance Corporation of India. He was lost for words when cops sought an explanation for the absence of mask. “I came out for two minutes. I will go back again,” he mumbled before being led into the van.Another man, when stopped, pulled a mask out of his pocket. “I came to the Chandni market to repair my phone. I always carry a mask,” he tried to explain. “The mask is for covering your face, not to be kept in your pocket,” a policeman told him sternly before pushing him into the van.“We have picked up at least 30 men in the past hour,” a policeman told The Telegraph around 4.10pm.At one point, there were three people waiting on the footpath as the van had gone to the police station.One of the cops at Chandni Chowk was heard telling a colleague: “We should have pushed more people into the van.”The colleague did not seem impressed. “To increase their and our chances of getting infected… is that what you want,” he asked.",2020-06-24 02:40:00
896,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Coronavirus pandemic: Colleges, varsities shut till July 31 in Bengal - Telegraph India","Colleges, universities and private educational institutions will remain closed till July 31, the Bengal government announced on Tuesday.“On May 30, the government had announced that all colleges, universities and private educational institutions will remain closed till June 30. In continuation of that order it has now been decided that closure will be extended till July 31,” education minister Partha Chatterjee told Metro on Tuesday afternoon.Hours after the announcement, the higher education secretary Manish Jain issued a notice saying “all government, government-aided, private educational institutions, training institutions, including hostels, will remain closed till July 31 in public interest”.The education department had in mid-June extended the closure of schools till July 31 “in public interest”.A university vice-chancellor said extending the closure till July 31 was inevitable, considering that minister Chatterjee had on June 13 said it would not be possible to start the academic session in the middle of a pandemic.In Bengal, the academic session in colleges and universities starts in mid-July after the publication of the Plus II board exam results in June.This year, the Plus II board exams are still to be completed and all boards are trying various models on how to complete the pending exams.“It has already been decided that graduating students will not sit for term exams. They will be assessed on their pre-semester results and internal assessments,” the VC said.Another VC said the HRD ministry had already announced that campuses would remain closed till August 15. “The education department is implementing in phases what the ministry has decided.”In a meeting with minister Chatterjee on June 13, several VCs had suggested to keep campuses closed in July, too, in view of the rising number of coronavirus patients and few transport options, an education department official said.A VC present at that meeting said he and the others had told the minister that the World Health Organisation had projected cases would peak in July. “We had requested him to consider the situation on the ground and defer the start of the academic session as far as possible,” the VC said.Lockdown restrictions have been eased but transport options are still “inadequate”; so, a student will find it difficult to reach his/her institute, another VC said.“We have been seeing how officegoers are travelling on buses disregarding distancing rules because transport options are few. If students are forced to travel like this, they will invite health hazard to campuses,” a college principal said. “It is better to keep campuses shut as long as possible till the situation on the ground improves.”",2020-06-24 02:51:00
897,Snehal Sengupta,Hyacinth macaw finds home in Alipore zoo - Telegraph India,"The Hyacinth macaw and the other birds rescued at the airport on Monday will find a new home at Alipore zoo.The Hyacinth macaw — a pair costs upwards of Rs 40 lakh, a little less than a BMW 3 Series — is the largest macaw species native to South America and is a prized possession of private collectors, a forest official said.Ashis Kumar Samanta, the director of Alipore zoo, said he could not recall when was the last time a Hyacinth macaw had been put on display at the zoo. “This is an exotic bird and we are planning to allot a large enclosure for it. We will keep some of the other rescued macaws in it.”The bird, according to zoo officials, is a juvenile. It is in the zoo hospital and will remain there for at least 20 days, a zoo official said. Doctors are keeping a round-the-clock check on its health and keepers are ensuring it gets its favourite fruits (apples and grapes) and nuts. “Since their beaks are quite hard they are fond of walnuts. They can break the tough shells easily,” the zoo official said.The bird, along with 21 other macaws, had been rescued from the airport. The consignment had been smuggled into the country from Bangladesh and was headed to Bangalore.The bureau, along with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, had rescued the birds in a joint operation and arrested two men.“The birds, including the Hyacinth macaw, are dehydrated… we are giving a solution of water mixed with sugar and salt apart from fruits and nuts. We have taken all precautionary measures,” zoo director Samanta said.Vinod Kumar Yadav, the member secretary of West Bengal Zoo Authority, a nodal agency that monitors and controls zoos all over the state, said this was possibly the first time a Hyacinth macaw had been brought to a zoo hospital. “They are a rare and exotic. We did not have them at the Alipore zoo. People should not keep them as pets… they are trapped in the wild and few survive the trauma of it. It is also illegal to keep them in captivity.”",2020-06-24 02:53:00
898,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Escape for father-in-law as gun jammed twice - Telegraph India,"Subhas Dhandhania, the 70-year-old who saw his wife Lalita being shot dead by son-in-law Amit Agarwal, had a close shave after Amit had pulled the trigger targeting the gun at him at least twice on Monday evening, police said on Tuesday.The improvised gun malfunctioned on both occasions. “‘Aap logon ka luck achchha hai (you are lucky)’, Amit said when the gun did not function the first time,” a police officer quoted Subhas as saying.The septuagenarian ran for his life when he found a moment to sneak out of the apartment while Agarwal was busy repairing the gun with a screwdriver after killing Lalita.Subhas ran out of the apartment in Rameshwaram Building, on RK Samadhi Road in Kankurgachhi, and bolted the door from outside before alerting Phoolbagan police station.The police on entering the flat found Lalita and Amit dead. Hours before, the police said, Amit had killed wife Shilpi in Bangalore and took a flight to Calcutta.Findings of preliminary investigations by the police suggest that Amit had gone to the Kankurgachhi flat prepared to kill both his in-laws and then end his life.“He had called his brother-in-law Vineet, a software engineer in Gurgaon, and asked him to come to Calcutta. It is apparent that he wanted to kill Vineet, too, and eliminate the entire family of his in-laws,” said an officer in the homicide wing of the detective department.Amit, a chartered accountant, had entered the Dhandhania apartment around 5.30pm. Subhas has told the police that the 42-year-old took out a gun immediately after stepping in and aimed it at him. The son-in-law was standing near the entrance of the apartment, blocking the way out.“The gun did not fire the first time he pulled the trigger. He started looking for a screwdriver. The elderly couple were frozen with shock and could barely move. By then the accused, who had been a regular visitor to the house, retrieved a screwdriver and repaired the gun,” the officer said.He pulled the trigger a second time. This time the gun fired but the bullet missed the target.Lalita was hit close to her chest in the third attempt. Subhas saw his wife slump and Amit aim the gun at him again. But the gun got stuck yet again.As Amit picked up the screwdriver for a second time to repair the gun, the elderly man took his chance and ran out. The police said the gun seized from the apartment, and suspected to have been used in the murder and suicide, was an improvised weapon resembling the look of a 7mm gun. “Amit got the gun on Monday, after returning from Bangalore. We are looking for the person who handed it to him,” an officer said.Lalita and Amit’s bodies underwent post-mortem on Tuesday. Both had one bullet each lodged.",2020-06-24 02:55:00
899,Subhankar Chowdhury, IIM leadership under fire from teachers - Telegraph India,"The board of governors of IIM Calcutta has started talking to some of the teachers who had earlier written to them about misgivings they have about the institute’s current leadership.This weekend, 22 teachers attended an online meeting of a committee constituted by the board.Some of the teachers who attended the meeting told The Telegraph they had spoken about the “absence of any forward-looking initiative over the past one-and-a-half years” and “the institute losing ground to other IIMs”.The teachers said what they told the committee was a follow-up to the letter that 51 teachers had written to the board in December.Fifty-one of 83 teachers had signed a letter to the board pointing out what they termed “deficiencies in the current administration”.In that letter, the teachers had spoken about “a toxic work environment with a significant trust deficit between the faculty and the leadership”, the leadership’s mistrust of the faculty, an administration with “slow, erratic and gridlocked decision-making, absence of plurality of views on the campus”.On Tuesday, a teacher told The Telegraph IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore had started new courses besides running the full-time residential courses. “But our institute has not witnessed the launch of any forward-looking initiative.”He spoke of a “new data centre with massive processing capacity to facilitate data protection and processing of data for research by faculty and students” at IIM Bangalore and “facilities in Dubai to capture the executive education market” by IIM Ahmedabad.“Newer IIMs such as the one in Kozhikode have launched master’s courses in emerging areas such as public policy. We don’t see anything in IIM-C,” the teacher said.One of the teachers said he had highlighted before the committee the authorities’ lack of effort in filling up vacant posts.“In January 2019, we had 90 teachers. Now, we are down to 83,” a teacher said. The sanctioned strength at IIM-C is 124.“Bangalore and Ahmedabad (IIMs) have more than 20 per cent greater faculty strength,” he said.A teacher said the leadership was cutting down on research in the name of cost control without realising that the course quality would take a hit.“The consultative and deliberative capacity of the academic council has been curbed substantially compared to other IIMs…. The apathy to the consultative process is leading to over centralization and predominance of arbitrariness over rules,” another teacher said.Most of the allegations were directed at the current administration led by Anju Seth, who took over as IIM Calcutta’s first woman director in 2018.“We do not comment on the internal affairs of the institute. On the other hand, you should be aware that IIM Calcutta ranked first in the Outreach & Inclusivity Parameter of the India Ranking 2020 by NIRF. This parameter considers the representation of women across roles among other key points of inclusive learning and opportunities,” director Seth said.“Last month, we were recognised as the only B school in the country to rank in the top-25 best B schools in the world by CEOWORLD — Best business schools in the world for 2020 rankings. IIM Calcutta was also ranked first amongst India’s B schools and 17th globally in Financial Times Masters in Management rankings, 2019.“These are amongst many other recognitions received in the last 18 months. I, as a proud alumna of IIM Calcutta, along with the board of governors and faculty, am committed to building IIM Calcutta as the top B school in India and amongst the best in the world.“I will also expect you to not be selective about using my quote in your story. You must use it in full. Please be advised to not pay heed to hearsay.”The committee is expected to submit a report to the board that would meet on June 25.",2020-06-24 02:58:00
900,Sanjay Mandal,Quick response team for critical Covid-19 patients - Telegraph India,"Government-run Covid hospitals will set up quick response teams to monitor and manage critical patients, the state health department said on Tuesday.Each quick response team will have an anaesthetist, a “medical officer” (who is a senior government doctor), two junior doctors (a postgraduate trainee and a housestaff) and a nurse trained in critical care.“Proper and proactive intervention at the right time can decrease mortality to a great extent. This is also evident from the model procedure adopted in some hospitals dealing with Covid patients,” an order issued by the health department on Tuesday states.The team should be functional 24 hours and attend to any critical patient, any time of the day or night, the order adds.The team will attend to critical patients immediately after they are identified by attending doctors after every visit in the morning and evening. The medical superintendents will hand over a list of critical patients to the quick response team of the respective hospitals.MR Bangur Superspeciality District Hospital in Tollygunge had set up such a team about two months back, the first government hospital dedicated for Covid treatment to do so.“The number of Covid beds at the hospital has gone up from 150 to 1,100. There were only a few Covid hospitals back then and MR Bangur was always flooded with patients,” said an official. “Initially, there was confusion among doctors and nurses on how to handle such patients.”Many patients admitted to the hospital had alleged that nurses were not coming near them or monitoring their health. Bodies of Covid patients were allegedly lying in the wards for hours.“About a couple of months back, we set up a quick response team comprising a senior physician and two postgraduate trainees of the medicine department. It was important to identify critical patients and ensure better management,” said Sishir Naskar, the medical superintendent of MR Bangur hospital.“Initially, doctors were visiting patients and writing down instructions about treatment. But there was a need to monitor the condition of critical patients between two rounds of visit. If someone’s condition worsens, intervention has to be prompt,” he said.The team was later expanded. Now, a quick response team is continuously deployed throughout the day. “They are concentrating on those patients who have been identified as critical by doctors and the hospital authorities,” said Naskar.",2020-06-24 02:59:00
901,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: IIT Kharagpur shifts students to two hostels - Telegraph India,"IIT Kharagpur has asked students who have yet to vacate their hostels because of inadequate transport to shift to two spacious hostels, where they will stay following physical distancing norms till they vacate the campus.The boys will be shifted to Madan Mohan Malviya (MMM) Hall of Residence, which has four blocks and can accommodate over 1,600 students. The girls will be lodged at Sister Nivedita (SNV) Hall.The IIT has 21 hostels, or halls of residence — 16 for boys and five for girls.Of the 3,200-odd students of the institute, only about 300 are still on the campus. The rest vacated the hostels by June 20 in compliance with a notice issued on June 10.Some of the 300-odd are from remote areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Jammu.“They (the students still on the campus) are being brought under two centralised facilities so wardens can ascertain whether physical distancing norms are being enforced,” said an official of the institute.A mail sent by the dean of students’ affairs, Somesh Kumar, says: “It is noticed that the number of boarders in most halls is very small. In view of the safety and security of the boarders, it is decided that the boarders of all the boys’ halls, should be shifted to MMM hall. Similarly the boarders of all girls’ halls should be shifted to SNV hall.”One of the students who is still on the campus said it was still not clear whether they would be allowed mess facilities.“All the mess staff have left. So far we are managing on our own…. It seems we have to continue like this,” he said.",2020-06-25 03:49:00
902,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown casts shadow on Dalhousie Institute’s financial health - Telegraph India,"A letter from the secretary of an over 150-year-old club, with copies marked to each member, is a pointer to the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The letter from Dalhousie Institute’s secretary is addressed to the general secretary of the employees’ union of the club. The immediate context is “delay in payment of salary of May 2020” to its 90-odd employees, permanent and contractual.The club has been shut since March 23.The office-bearers said that in the absence of revenue from liquor and food and following a dip in monthly subscriptions because of the lockdown, it was virtually impossible to make payouts like before.The Ballygunge club, spread over 60 cottahs, has a sprawling lawn, bar, dining room, two lounge areas, a swimming pool, three tennis courts, a multi-sport turf and a badminton court, and rooms for indoor games like table tennis and snooker. Over 80 per cent of the club’s revenue comes from bar sales, said an official, adding that it was “pointless to reopen the club without an operational bar”.Members of the council — the decision-making body of the club — said salaries and maintenance were the main expense components. The source of income, apart from food and beverage sales, was monthly subscriptions of the 2,000-odd members.The club was already reeling under a financial crunch and the Covid-19 crisis brought things to a grinding halt, said an official.“We were able to pay monthly salaries to the workers because we earned something every month. The shutdown has stopped income. As a result, we are having trouble in giving full salaries,” said Miraj D. Shah, the treasurer.The letter also speaks of members “themselves facing financial crisis”, aggravating the club's financial crunch.The problems will find an echo in other legacy clubs of the city as well. In normal circumstances, the tinkling of glasses on a sun-kissed evening on a lush green lawn makes a perfect picture. But a virus that has made socialising an almost dreaded word threatens to change all of it.The DI letter points out that the admission of “3000 plus new members” would offset the mounting losses. But in the same breadth, it also adds that the existing club infrastructure “can never support” the admission of so many new members.  The letter says the club “incurred a loss of Rs 203.39 lakh for the year ended 31st March 2019”. “One of the primary reasons for the loss has been high salary costs of the club… The total income of the club from subscription and surplus from food and beverages for the year ended 31st March 2019 was Rs 254.69 lakh and the salary cost for the same period was Rs 352.84 lakh,” says the letter from the honorary secretary, Michael N. Rao.The other operational costs, like annual maintenance contracts with outsourced agencies and electricity consumption, made up the remaining components of the loss, said Shah.“The pandemic is nothing but sort of a death knell to our club,” the letter says.The letter says the council (the decision-making body of the club, elected by its members) “has decided to pay 50 per cent of the salary/wages for the month of May 2020 and the salary/wages for the subsequent months will be solely dependant on the financial ability of the club and the monetary resources”.A section of the workers, affiliated to the All India Trade Union Congress, has been staging a demonstration outside the Ballygunge club for the past couple of days.“I have given more than two decades to this place. How will I sustain my family if the club does not stand by me in this moment of crisis?” said one of the demonstrators on Wednesday.Jayajit Biswas, the president, said the salary slabs of the club were above the industry standard.The letter buttresses his claim. It says that under existing guidelines, the club “is required to pay a minimum wage of Rs 20,581 per month” compared to the “minimum wage for waiters etc, as prescribed by the labour department of the Government of West Bengal for the period January 2020 is Rs 8,349 per month”.“The maximum monthly salary drawn by a bearer in our club is Rs 41,549,” said Shah, the treasurer.Biswas said the club had been a “generous provider” to its employees in the past and expected the workers to “extend some cooperation at this critical juncture”.",2020-06-25 03:54:00

Similar arrangements were made to transport them to the Mumbai airport.A section of NUJS students had started planning to help the workers after they learnt about their plight. When the lockdown was relaxed, the students got in touch with three NGOs in Mumbai for help to identify the workers, said Shukla. “We came to know from the NGOs that 180 migrant workers from Uttarakhand were stuck in Mumbai,” he said.The cost of flying the migrant workers on a chartered flight of a particular airline would be around Rs 15 lakh.The students got in touch with the alumni, many of them now employed with reputable law firms and companies in India and in London and Singapore. Teachers and some well-wishers were also approached. “They all donated generously. We could collect Rs 15 lakh within four days,” said Shukla.",2020-06-25 03:57:00

906,Subhajoy Roy,Calcutta Municipal Corporation to build two more electric pyres at Dhapa - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has started work on building two additional electric pyres at the Dhapa crematorium where people dying from Covid-19 are being cremated. The crematorium at Dhapa has two pyres but civic officials said they were augmenting the capacity to ensure there was no delay in cremation. After Cyclone Amphan, a queue of Covid-19 bodies had formed as power supply to the crematorium had snapped. Atin Ghosh, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators, said the pyres would be ready in three to four months.The crematorium was earlier used to cremate unclaimed bodies. But the civic body designated it for Covid-19 bodies after it faced resistance in other crematoriums in the city. “We will now cremate unclaimed bodies at Nimtala crematorium. Dhapa will solely be used to cremate Covid-19 bodies,” Ghosh said. The burial of Covid-19 bodies is being done at the Bagmari burial ground. The cremation guidelines say a Covid-19 body must be placed “in leak-proof plastic body bag. The exterior of the body bag can be decontaminated with 1% hypochlorite. The body bag can be wrapped with a mortuary sheet or sheet provided by the family members”.The body, secured in a body bag, exterior of which has been decontaminated poses no additional risk to people transporting the body, according to the guidelines. “The main driver of transmission of Covid-19 is droplets. There is unlikely to be an increased risk of infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling a body.”",2020-06-25 03:59:00
908,Our Special Correspondent,Mother who rescued her daughter from man attempting to molest her dies in hospital - Telegraph India,"A 55-year-old woman died on Wednesday of injuries sustained trying to free her daughter from the clutches of a man in Howrah’s Bagnan on Tuesday, police said.The man, Kush Bera, the husband of a Trinamul panchayat samiti member, has been arrested, along with another person, on charges of murder, outrage of modesty and trespassing.“Trinamul has nothing to do with the crime. Law will take its own course. We have told the police to investigate the matter to its core and arrest the culprit. The man has already been arrested,” Trinamul MLA from Uluberia South, Pulak Roy, said.The woman’s daughter, a second-year college student, has said in her complaint with Bagnan police station she was with her mother on their single-storey building’s rooftop on Tuesday night.“The young woman has said she was playing games on her phone around 12.30am in the presence of her mother. Her mother headed downstairs for some work and she decided to join her,” an officer quoted her as saying in the complaint.“Around the same time, a man whom she identified as Kush kaku grabbed her. As she started screaming, her mother came rushing up.”She has told cops that the man, later identified as Kush Bera, was hiding on the rooftop.The woman tried to free her daughter when the man apparently pushed her before fleeing. She fell down the stairs, the police said.The woman had received serious injuries to the head, Soumya Roy, superintendent of police (Howrah rural), said. She had been admitted to a government hospital on Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning, she died of her injuries.“As there was no complaint in the morning, we had started an unnatural death case. Later in the day, the woman’s daughter filed a specific complaint and we arrested two people based on the complaint,” Roy said.In her complaint, she has said there was an attempt to molest her and that her mother had arrived on hearing her screams and tried to rescue her from the man, the police said.She will undergo a medical test to ascertain if she had been sexually assaulted.The other person arrested is Bera’s associate who was on guard outside the home.On Wednesday, as news of the woman’s death spread, several political leaders landed up at her home to meet her daughter. Some blocked the Khadinan crossing in Bagnan alleging police inaction. The blockade was lifted after the police intervened.",2020-06-25 04:01:00
909,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: 3 documents for home isolation nod in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Asymptomatic Covid-19 patients or ones with mild symptoms have to provide three documents, along with an application, to be considered eligible for home isolation, officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the state health department have said. The documents are a declaration each from a doctor that she or he will monitor the patient daily, from a caregiver that he or she will provide food and other stuff at the door of the room where the patient will stay alone and from a neighbour or a relative that he or she will deliver ration at the family’s doorstep.Along with the three papers, the patient has to send an application to the civic body expressing his or her desire to be at home. The patient has to state in the application that he or she will stay alone in a room with an attached toilet.The civic body will forward the documents to the state health department, which will decide on the application. If the request for home isolation is rejected, the patient has to be shifted to a satellite health facility of a private hospital or a “safe home” of the state government.“If a Calcuttan tests positive for Covid-19, the health department gets in touch with the person immediately. Based on enquiries over the phone, a preliminary assessment is done. If it is found that the person has mild symptoms and prefers to stay at home, health department officials ask him or her to ready the documents,” a CMC official said. Civic health workers then visit the home to collect the papers and verify whether the claims are true or not. “If it is found that the person shares a room with others, she or he will be asked to shift to a quarantine centre, paid or free. If the person or the family resists, police and the local ward coordinator are asked to intervene,” a CMC official said.The doctor’s certificate is meant to ensure that the patient is always under proper medical care. “This is an additional layer of protection. If a patient’s condition worsens suddenly, the doctor will intervene,” the official said.The CMC has a team that calls up patients in home quarantine every day to enquire about his or her health.The caregiver’s letter is needed to know that the patient will get cooked meals at home and there is someone at home who can do basic monitoring of his or her health. The letter from a neighbour or relative who will deliver ration at the doorstep is necessary because the family members will not be allowed to step out for two weeks.“Since the family members are the primary contacts of the patients, they must remain quarantined at home for 14 days,” a health department official said. The state government has allowed private hospitals to open satellite facilities in nearby properties where asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients can stay. The people in the satellite facilities will be monitored and under regular check-up of the hospital. “The mild or asymptomatic patients need not be admitted in hospital. They can remain under care of doctors in a satellite facility,” said a health department official.",2020-06-25 04:03:00
910,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus lockdown: Cycles pedal back, so do bicycle thieves - Telegraph India","Cycles have returned to the target list of thieves after a brief hiatus as more people choose cycles over public transport in times of the coronavirus.Several cycles were stolen from across the city in the past few weeks and police officers said they could not recall the last time such complaints had been registered.Most of the stolen ones were new cycles bought by people who wanted to use them instead of travelling by public transport with many people to their places of work.Many of those who have reported their cycles have been stolen said they used to pedal down from Behala, Bhowanipore and Narkeldanga to reach their offices in Dalhousie.“We used to hear of bicycle thefts in the early phase of our policing career. The crime index board in police stations used to have the last row dedicated to theft of cycles. Motorcycles replaced the word cycles over the years,” an officer of the detective department’s anti-burglary wing that looks into cycle thefts said. “There were not even 10 bicycle thefts last year in the entire city.”“Lifters” were more keen on motorcycles, taxis, Matadors and lorries, the officer said. The returns on resale were always worth the effort.Cycles have emerged as the new target with the relaxation of lockdown restrictions.A week ago, a geared mountain bike was stolen from inside a housing complex in Sinthee in north Calcutta. Earlier this month, a bicycle was stolen from a house in the Regent Park area in south Calcutta.Both thefts have been reported and FIRs drawn up based on the complaints. Many cycle thefts have gone unreported, though, the police said.Many cycle owners said they wanted to avoid legal hassles. Some said the cycles were old but “good enough for a few kilometres”.Some cyclists from parts of Behala, Bhowanipore and Muchipara said the locks had been prised open, possibly with a saw.The cycle that was stolen in Sinthee was a costly one, the police said. The owner, a woman, had parked the cycle in her housing complex at night. In the morning, it was gone.“Someone who knew of her new possession must have passed on the information to lifters,” an officer of Sinthee police station said. “We are on the job. Let’s see.”Mountain bikes or MTBs come in various heights ranging between 4ft and 6ft plus. Their prices vary between Rs 17,000 and Rs 25,000, a cycle shop owner said. A normal cycle will cost anything between Rs 4,000 an Rs 6,000.A cycle was stolen from a house in Nandalal Mitra Lane in Regent Park between June 11 and 12. The cycle was a few years old but the owner had started reusing it frequently. “We will crack the case in a day or two,” an officer of Regent Park police station said.Gautam Mukherjee, a resident of Roy Bahadur Road in Behala, said he had bought a new cycle for his son a little over a week ago. The cycle went missing from the parking lot of his apartment a few days ago. “It was stolen at night,” Mukherjee said. “I didn’t file a police complaint because it is usually very difficult, if not impossible, to trace a stolen cycle.”“The theft figures may not be alarmingly high at present but it shows thieves have set their eyes on a new target in this new normal,” an officer said. “We will urge all housing associations to ensure CCTV cameras in their complexes are functioning. The same holds true for banks and markets.”",2020-06-25 04:11:00
911,Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus lockdown: Safety measures ramped up in offices after the pandemic - Telegraph India,"If your office is in Sector V or New Town maybe it takes you 15 minutes to reach. But post lockdown the sanitisation procedure at the office entrance has become so thorough that maybe it takes you another 15 or 20 minutes to enter!The first check at Shyamadas De’s office is when the security guard asks to see the employee’s phone. “He checks the status on our Aarogya Setu app and lets us in only if it says we are safe,” says the HA Block resident, adding that at least one employee has been sent home as the app said he was only moderately safe.Next, is the thermal gun, pulse and oxygen saturation checks. If the employee clears these, he walks through a “tunnel sanitisation” structure that sprays disinfectant from all sides. He steps out into a low bucket to cleanse his shoes. But either way he has to leave his shoes outside and walk into the actual office with only his socks on. “My office, a construction company, is following the ‘safety first’ mantra and we feel safe with how fool-proof the entire procedure is,” he says. Cars in the parking lot get sprayed with sanitiser and inside the office, the entire space gets sanitised every two hours. All washroom fittings have been made “contact-less” and any documents sent to them have to lie in isolation at the gate for three days before being allowed in. Strange as this may sound, it’s the new normal. Most offices are now implementing as many such safety protocols as possible to allow business to run in the backdrop of Covid-19.At arm’s lengthOften, employees themselves are going the extra mile to enforce social distancing. Basiakhi’s Debojit Basu (name changed) says his friends who work at Bikash Bhavan have tied empty chairs around their seats and desks to ensure no one comes too close.“Social distancing has forced us to sit so far apart that during meetings we have to shout to be heard,” says Sumona Roy, another resident of Baisakhi, who works at a bank.DA Block’s Swarnava Mukherjee says his colleagues are using toothpick to press lift buttons. “I’m using tissue paper,” he says. Like many others, returning to office for him has meant having to don jeans and trousers after months of the ever-comfortable shorts at home.Mrinmoy Ghosh has been asked to stop using the lift altogether, as his office is only on the first floor. “No visitors are allowed in any more. Even my driver, who would previously help bring in my bags and files, has to stay out. The tea-served-in-the-room system has been abolished and we now have to pour tea ourselves from the vending machine,” says the BC Block resident who works at an aluminium production facility.Suffocating masksThe ubiquitous symbol of Covid-19 — the mask — has become quite a detested piece of clothing in office. “My phone’s face recognition feature does not work in office as my face is half covered by the mask,” says Swarnava. “Not only is it suffocating to wear all the time, but it’s a barrier to communication too as we can’t read one another’s expressions.”Speaking of his friends at Bikash Bhavan, Basu says the mask has made small talk quite a challenge. “One cannot recognise another with the mask on, let alone determine if he is a junior or senior at work. It’s rude to admit one cannot recognise a colleague but equally difficult to carry on a conversation without recognising him or her,” he says.Balaka Abasan’s Rakesh Gupta says the mask gets so smelly upon constant use that he’s tying a hanky around his face while at work now.No country for foodiesMonika Roy recalls the lovely food she would choose from her office canteen before the lockdown. “Even the Dalhousie area, where my office is located, has great street food. But all that is out of bounds now,” she says sadly. The resident of Eastern Grove is now taking biscuits for lunch. “Without a domestic help, I’m not getting a tiffin box and adding to the pile of utensils to wash myself!”A resident of East Enclave, who works at a government office behind Jalasampad Bhavan, has been surviving on biscuits too. “I’m scared of bringing too many bags now-a-days lest I have to sanitise them all. It’s better to finish a biscuit packet and dispose it right away,” he says.Many offices have banned food delivery services and the endearing practise of sharing tiffin has been shot dead too. “Now if anyone asks to share tiffin he is asked to show his Covid test result in jest,” laughs Basu.Commute challengeFor many, the commute is the toughest part of the day. Basu had to cycle from Baisakhi to his office near Rabindra Tirtha for a few days. “It was taking nearly an hour and it was too hot,” says the man who hops on a bus now. “Still, my plight is nothing compared to a colleague who came from Dhonekhali by lorry! Seems the lorry was ferrying multiple passengers for a fare.”Sumona’s father drops her to her Tollygunge office in the morning but she returns by bus in the evening. “The government buses are maintaining social distancing but the private buses are spilling over with passengers. We have to yell at the conductor to stop boarding more people,” she grumbles.AJ Block’s Moinak Dutta has quit the auto and bus and now asks his driver to ferry him to work. So many employees have switched to commuting by private cars now that Roy says it has become difficult finding parking space near her office. “Besides, it’s not cheap hiring a driver and paying for petrol to Dalhousie from New Town everyday,” she says.For the first few days, S.P. Bagla, chairman of a real estate company, gladly walked to office. “It felt great to be out in the open after prolonged confinement,” he says.Many cycles are out on the road too. In fact, a few weeks ago, a man sneaked into a CJ Block driveway, walked past the two parked cars, and rode off with their domestic help’s son’s bicycle. The entire episode was caught on CCTV. In the township, autorickshaws are travelling with a plastic screen separating the front seats from the rear. The screen has been mandated by the police to ensure social distancing. Each auto is allowed to carry two passengers, leaving the driver’s side free. “It took me Rs 50 to buy plastic and tape to put up the screen. Since we are having to take less passengers we are charging Rs 20 in place of Rs 12 from SAI (Sports Authority of India) to Karunamoyee. The minimum fare of Rs 6 has also been increased to Rs 10,” said Arpan Dey, an autorickshaw driver. With passengers few and far between, the union has deivised a rotation policy so every driver has an income. “There are 118 autos on our route. Half of us are playing on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in one week and on the other days the following week. Our income used to be Rs 1,000 to 1,400 per day earlier. Now we make barely Rs 300 to Rs 400,” he added.The auto drivers have heard routes in Calcutta reverting to the full passenger capacity of four. “But we are having a tough time getting two passengers per vehicle so we are not keen ourselves to take more per trip. Earlier, people took an auto to reach even short distances like SAI to AMRI (Hospitals). But with offices having become lax with punctuality many are preferring to walk rather than pay the increased fare,” he said.“People are not going out in panic. Also unless the trains start, we will not get enough passengers,” said Amar Gupta, who drives on the Karunamoyee-Phoolbagan route.Waste of time“Fear of Covid has led to a dip in productivity,” says a businessman of CF Block. “They are spending too much time talking about the disease and sanitising their hands, files and equipment.” Swarnava talks of what a bother it is to get home and sanitise his clothes, spectacles, phone, watch… Jibadip Bhadury, who works for a digital marketing firm, explains how difficult it is working with 50 per cent attendance. “A standard piece of work requires a social media manager, designer, IT technician and client servicing personnel. Without all of them in the room, we have to make 10 calls to execute a simple task,” he says.Making it worse is the new work schedule. “Without a proper transport system, people are hitchhiking to work. They’re reaching at 11, leaving at 4.30, so when will they sit to work? They are also finding it difficult to focus since they are constantly worrying about Covid and job losses.”Missing office Aryama Sen was starry-eyed about flying to Gurgaon to do her internship this summer but has not settled for logging into her computer for work. “My colleagues are trying their best to keep me in the loop but I’m missing out on actual interface,”  says the engineering student. Lawyer Chandrasekhar Bag has been a part of “virtual courtrooms” during the lockdown but he too, misses the real McCoy. “Digital hearings are possible for cases on intellectual property and corporate law as they rely heavily on paperwork. But for criminal law we need to make passionate speeches to the judge. The tiny phone screen doesn’t allow us to read the opponent’s expressions and body language and so we cannot prepare our next move accordingly,” says the BK Block resident. If nothing else, DA Block’s Anushreea Paul wants to get back to office to meet her colleagues. “I miss  human interaction. At home, I only meet my husband and in-laws and a ‘break’ only means switching from office work to chores. At my New Town office, a break meant relaxation. We would go to the ‘jhoops’ outside for tea and catch up with colleagues.”Future at workMost people spoken to felt the lockdown had changed offices for good. “Before this, I never believed work could be done from home so smoothly,” said Ashwini Kedia, who runs a sustainable woodwork company. “I always had an office corner at home but never used it till now and it’s great!”Swarnava notes that working from home allows offices to save on overheads and Mrinmoy feels offices might legitimately slash travel allowance as employees may not be required to commute any more.“The cabs and autos are all charging extra post-lockdown. Why should we pay through our nose, and risk our lives stepping out, when our work can be from home,” asks Ankita Baid, a BF Block-based lawyer who has been conducting virtual hearings the past few weeks. “Plus now that we have got used to this lifestyle, many of us are feeling lazy to go out again.” Aryama, too, says going out after three months at home may require some getting used to.Jibadip knows of companies that have started giving up sprawling Sector V spaces in favour of compact apartments in residential Salt Lake.Then there are those like Rajib Roy, who have not only changed their lifestyle but even their profession to suit the lockdown. “When I was a consultant I would spend Rs 500 to 1,000 every time I went out for work. But from March 31, I began share trading. I hardly needed an investment, do not have to beg or bribe anyone to sanction my plans and don’t need to step out of the house,” says the AC Block resident. “This when my friends are having to go to work in the middle of this outbreak to save their jobs.”Additional reporting by Sudeshna BanerjeeHow is your experience of return to work in the Unlock phase?

912,Snehal Sengupta,No clearance of garbage of coronavirus infected families - Telegraph India,"Garbage bags piling up in the driveways and passages of homes of Covid-19 patients in Salt Lake are raising a stink as the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has stopped collecting litter from these houses.Five residents and a household help who used to work in different houses have tested positive for Covid-19 in mayor Krishna Chakraborty’s ward over the last four days.According to a family member of one of the patients, the corporation has stopped garbage collection from their home. “We have garbage piling up on our driveway and near the garage. Corporation workers refuse to come near our house,” said the wife of a Covid-19 patient.A senior official of the corporation’s waste management department admitted that the workers were scared to tread near any house from where a resident has tested positive.“They are scared. We are requesting them to go and collect garbage but we cannot force them to,” said the official, requesting to remain unnamed.The Central Pollution Control Board has issued a set of guidelines for garbage disposal from the houses of Covid-19 patients. Double layered bags, mandatory labelling and colour coded bins are mandatory for the management of waste generated during the diagnosis and treatment of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients, the guidelines say. The apex pollution monitoring body said specific guidelines are required to be followed by urban local bodies, isolation wards, quarantine centres, sample collection centres, laboratories and common biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities, in addition to existing practices under Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has roped in an agency to handle such waste, a CMC official said.The Bidhannagar civic body does not have a specialised team to handle waste generated from such homes, another official said. “Most agencies use incinerators to burn such waste. We don’t have the facility,” he said.  Of the five who tested positive recently one is a 46-year-old medical practioner from AL Block who is admitted to a government-run hospital in the city. A 33-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman from a family that stays in CJ Block have also tested positive on Monday. They are in home quarantine with their family.  Two men from another CJ Block house tested positive on Tuesday and are in home isolation, a civic official said. A domestic help who used to work in this family’s house has also tested positive and she too is in home quarantine, the official said. The mayor, who is also the local councillor, said that of the two families in CJ Block, one had a factory in Howrah while another owned a Burrabazar shop. “They were frequenting their workplaces. We have sanitised the area,” said Chakraborty.Asked about garbage piling up in homes of the infected, Chakraborty said she would look into it.The number of coronavirus cases has crossed the 300 mark in the 41 wards of the corporation with fresh cases being reported from Rajarhat, Kestopur, Mangal Ganthi and Baguiati, apart from Salt Lake.Scene in New TownInfection is rising in New Town too. Sanjeeva Town the Bungalow Estate has reported nine cases in three families. Three of them have been hospitalised. On June 21, Mallika Malancha and the Refugee Rehabilitation Colony in AA Block reported cases. The next day, a case was reported in Alaktika. On Wednesday, infections were reported in Sankalpa 2 and Elita Garden Vista as well. The total number in New Town has crossed 40, according to war room sources.Additional reporting by Sudeshna banerjee",2020-06-26 01:02:00

915,The Telegraph,Coronavirus Lockdown diaries: Salt Lake Residents share how they are spending time indoors - Telegraph India,"Srijita TalukdarResident of: Renaissance Housing Society, New Town Half of my days are spent attending online classes, and completing and mailing assignments. But after that I’m doing quite a lot.  Reading a good book is bliss and I’ve just read Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, The Fault in Our Stars, The Kite Runner and I am now reading Chander Pahar by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay. After a long time, I also have time to paint. Not that I’m great at it but painting helps me de-stress. I finished watching Operation MBBS and Little Things (Season 3) and am now streaming the web series Kota Factory and the crime series Breathe. I am hooked to DIY (do it yourself) craft videos on YouTube and thanks to them have painted almost all my “mason jar” drinking glasses with various colourful designs. I also made a few scrap wood frames and room decor. The life hack videos have also taught me to turn my old clothes into cool outfits! Though I have to study till late night, I get up early to meditate. This keeps me calm and relaxed the whole day. I am also following online exercise classes, doing squats, side planks and zumba. My mother and I have been experimenting with new cake recipes, such as red velvet cake, which was delicious! Baking is our new-found love. I am also pursuing advanced French classes online and am writing a horror story for my school magazine. Animesh Ranjan DasResident of: BaguiatiPreviously I used to take out time for family activities from my busy work schedule but now the tables have turned. Now I am giving more time to my family and taking out pockets to complete office work.My five-year-old daughter would always complain that I neither spend time with her nor play with her. My wife had the same grouse. She said I never sat to help our daughter with her studies. But now I’m getting the opportunity to spend time lots of quality time with her.Dayita ChakrabortyResident of: Millenium Tower Going to bed early and getting up after 10 o’clock has become a daily routine. Mom has taken out her recipe book and started experimenting with new dishes (they’re all plate-licking good!) It has been long since I last read comics or mystery books but now, with the AC on, I lie on my bed and read the adventures of Tintin and Feluda. I’ve regained my passion for writing stories and am working on a horror-crime-fiction called No. 13.Our locality is now calm and quiet and we can hear the chirping of so many varieties of birds from dawn till dusk! These days may be boring but they’re definitely musical! But I feel bad for Keltu, a timid street dog I would previously offer biscuits and bread to. Wonder if he manages food now. Should a vegetable-vendor be spotted outside, everyone is dashing to him like they’ll find the last of Willy Wonka’s golden tickets with him! Earlier dad would return home by 8pm but these days he’s at his computer and answering calls 24 hours a day. What really annoys me is that the domestic helps are sleeping at home and we are paying them! These are really weird days.Debanjana RayResident of: Bangur AvenueI was supposed to get promoted to Class VI this April. I was very excited, but then this Coronavirus came along and now my friends and I are unable to go to school. Now, during lockdown I am studying very hard as our teacher gives us new lessons every week. I am also watching Project Mc² on Netflix. Then I am helping my mother in the kitchen by mixing spices, peeling eggshells off boiled eggs etc. I am also exercising daily as we have to stay healthy in this time of coronavirus.Ashmidyuti BhattacharyaResident of: BE BlockBeing in Class VII, I barely knew the meaning of words like lockdown and isolation before this. But now, not only have I understood the meanings, but have also learnt that we can live without fast food, without going out and can stay in contact with our extended family virtually. Now I am playing cricket for two hours almost every day, practising my batting, bowling and even fielding. This I could not do if school was on. I can also do gardening, again something I may never get time for when school resumes. Previously I would get so much homework and external studies that I would get to play the synthesiser once in a blue moon. Now I am so happy playing it!I like sky-watching at night as the sky is clear and the surroundings hushed. I am pursuing photography as there are many new kinds of birds which I had never seen around before. I am even getting to play games such as ludo and carrom with my family members, when earlier I could not even talk to them!Before the lockdown, I had a chock-a-block schedule but strangely it is now that I’m doing more work. Still I am mystified as to whether my prior life was better or this one, as now I cannot meet my friends. On the other hand, previously, I could not spend time with family. That is something I’m enjoying now.Swechcha Dhara DasguptaResident of: Sraboni Abason, FC BlockThis too shall pass. It is perhaps clutching on to these words that people all over the world are passing through the days fraught with the fear of Covid-19. I am no exception.Through the onslaught of online classes and panicking about buying essentials, we are all overwhelmed by loneliness and the fear of the uncertain. To help myself overcome these, I have begun a social media initiative to bring everyone together. The initiative, run in Bengali so as to reach out to the masses, is called Ghorbondir Dinjapon (Living amidst a lockdown).Every day I share my mother’s poetry, written for these fearful times, along with a recipe or art video emphasising the values of zero wastage and conservation of resources. People watching these posts send me their own writings or recipes which I compile and share.Maybe this is a tiny attempt but in these times of fear and divisiveness, this is the manifestation of my wish to keep everyone together and to remind and remember that it is darkest before dawn. ",2020-06-26 01:05:00
916,Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus pandemic: Rathyatra celebrated by organisations of Salt Lake while maintaining social distancing - Telegraph India,"With the traditional Rathyatra ruled out this year due to lockdown restrictions, some organisations worked around tradition to find a middle path that would maintain social distancing and still allow a journey by the idols. From BF Block on Tuesday, the lords travelled across the township as always, but instead of chariots, they went by car. At DD Block, the chariot was pulled out of the driveway and turned around as soon as it reached the metalled road. Thereafter, the idols took a ride on cars. New wheels  The Bidhannagar Sree Chaitanya Bhagabat Samaj idols stay at BF 20 round the year and travel to their “aunt’s house” at Central Park during Rathyatra where a fair takes place alongside. This year, the idols were placed in cars and driven to Central Park by the organisers. “The convoy of four cars halted outside the fairground for a few minutes and then took the usual Rathyatra route to City Centre, PNB and went back to BF Block,” said general secretary of the body, Kumar Sankar Sadhu. The third floor of BF 20 is left entirely to the lords round the year and they are now being kept in a different room on the same floor to signify their aunt’s house. “Disciples may come for darshan from 5pm to 8pm every day till Ultarath,” said Debasish Roy, who lives on the first floor of the building. “Masks are mandatory for entry and sanitisers are kept too. We are only allowing two or three people in at a time.”BL Block’s Tuli Basu went over to pray on the very first day of the Rathyatra. “I’ve been pulling this chariot since its initial years. Even if that wasn’t possible this time, I wanted to make a contribution towards the flowers and tulsi malas for the idols,” she said. “I was very happy with the arrangements, especially how only two people are being allowed into the lift at a time.”Change of vehiclesBidhannagar Ramakrishna Vivekananda Kendra in DD Block had initially secured permission to roll their chariot without fanfare but the police later asked them to cancel it altogether.“So we pulled the rath till the road and took it back,” said president of the body, Chanchal De, who along with other members then drove the idols around DD Block by car. “Being a doctor myself, I understand how important social distancing in the case of Covid but by tweaking our customs a little bit, we managed to uphold tradition too.”A few devotees had come for the ritual and they were very supportive of the method devised. “My grandmother had passed away at this very centre when she had come to pray back in 2010. Two days before that, she had come here to pull Jagannath’s chariot. Since this festival and institute meant so much to her, I wanted to come despite the pandemic,” said Sanghamitra Paul of BF Block. “Of course, I’m following all safety precautions.”Anindo Sardar of Class IV was one of the lucky few who got to travel in the car with Lord Jagannath. The boy, who studies in the school run by the centre, was amused by the ‘modern chariot’. “I think Jagannath liked the car ride,” said the boy who sat next to the idol.The ceremony concluded with the distribution of prasad, especially papad bhaja that is customary during this festival, among devotees gathered at the centre.",2020-06-26 01:05:00
918,Sudeshna Banerjee,Matters of the mind - Telegraph India,"How is the lockdown taking a toll on the mental health of residents? And what are the ways to identify symptoms from the behavioural patterns of family members? Psychiatrist Kedar Ranjan Banerjee addressed such issues at a recent session webcast on the social media platform of New Town Residents’ Welfare Forum. This is what he had to say —The population today can be divided into two groups — the coronavirus affected and the unaffected. Neither group is mentally in a good state. The corona affected are small in number. The others are under pressure because of lockdown. Offices may have opened in the unlock phase but with trains and most buses not plying normally, we have to remember that we are still under lockdown.Of those who are mentally affected, about 20 to 30 per cent are suffering from depression. That is the tip of the iceberg. If we do a survey on 100 random people with a questionnaire, we will see that 60 to 70 per cent are suffering from anxiety.Of course, depression existed even before this novel coronavirus came. But this is acting as a major trigger.Depression can be of two kinds —primary and secondary.If someone falls ill during an examination and fails, he would get depressed. But that is depression for a definite cause. That is called secondary depression.But if a working professional, with family, starts feeling blue when he likes nothing, does not feel like doing anything or going out, feels like crying, those are cases of primary depression.Most coronavirus-related depressions are secondary, triggered by the lockdown or the constant worry about people getting infected. But primary depression, which was suppressed all this while, is also surfacing in many during this period.Spot the symptomsOne has to be on the lookout for symptoms. Sleep disorder is one. Waking up very early, like at 2.30am or 3am, and not being able to sleep again, loss of interest, becoming irritable and losing one’s temper at the drop of a hat are some of the common manifestations. Depressed people also develop problems of cognition. They become indecisive. They also report diminishing energy levels, even refusing to get out of bed.However, depression does not happen overnight. If family members and friends are aware, they can notice the symptoms early and seek professional help. Anti-depressants work wonderfully and a patient can make recovery in two to four weeks.One question we get asked a lot is if the medicines we are prescribing are sleeping pills. Medical science has progressed a lot and these days, we allow patients to even drive.What has to be overcome is the stigma. To many, a psychiatrist is still pagoler doctor. I have had even educated friends asking me to visit them at home to check on their child or some family member as they are wary of being seen in a psychiatrist’s chamber.We do a psychometry test to see if a person is suffering only from depression or if there is something more to it.Depression can be in four stages — mild, moderate, severe and major. Mild or moderate depression can be managed with counselling. For more serious stages, we reduce the severity with anti-depressants first. If a person is in such a state that he is not getting up from bed or even refusing to take water, there is no point counselling him then.Emotional manifestations of depression and anxiety occur due to reduced serotonin levels in the brain which need medication to be raised.There can be another type of depression — bipolar affective disorder. Such people alternate between two extreme states. They can experience elevated moods when they eat a lot or talk a lot. If they are asked to buy half dozen eggs from the market they end up buying two dozen. If the cost of something comes to Rs 12, they give away Rs 20. At other times, they withdraw into a shell.Like in case of a cancer patient, counselling will not work for a depressed person who has been diagnosed with Covid-19.But those who are not infected can be taken to be suffering from secondary depression. Counselling mostly works with them, though sometimes they too need anti-depressants.How to avoid anxietyLifestyle changes: Exercise. If there is no space in your apartment, go up to the roof or the driveway downstairs. Coronavirus is not roaming in the streets, waiting to catch you. You can easily do free hand exercises in the park, keeping distance from everyone else. That will improve your night’s sleep.Social media: Avoid Facebook, WhatsApp and all such social media. They are teeming with fake news and alarmist views on coronavirus.TV: Stay away from news channels round the clock. If you have to watch news, do so at a fixed hour. We are getting children who say they are scared of the TV set, which must be because of what they hear as the news is kept on all day. Feel free to watch other programmes.Focus on positives: Lockdown has given us a lot. We are bonding with family members. Communication keeps the blues at bay. Pick up the phone to speak to people. You will end up renewing ties with many you have lost touch with. Communication will lighten the mood.Food: Eat on time and eat healthy food.A word on childrenEven if offices are open, the children are still at home. They have to be told that it is not vacation. There is a problem around which is why they are not being allowed outside. They should be made to follow the same routine as they do when school is open. Of course, play time is more now but they must study when it is time to study. We are getting children too who are coming with depression.Depression or anxietyThe symptoms of the two may be similar but there are some differences which can be marked. Sleep comes quickly in case of depression while in anxiety, one finds it hard to fall asleep. Irritability is there in both states. But in depression, one lacks motivation and finds little interest in anything. In anxiety, there is an unknown fear that clouds the mind — what if my 88-year-old aunt gets corona?Sometimes there is a mixed anxiety with depression, in which both symptoms are manifest.A new disorderWashing of hands, a vital step to stay safe from Covid-19, is emerging as a major mental problem worldwide. Research papers are being written on the subject. The problem is obsessive compulsive disorder. Such a person washes his hands but feels the hands did not clean yet. So he feels a discomfort till he can wash the hands again. When he gets to place his hands under the running tap again, he feels exhilarated.Case for common senseStay safe but apply your common sense. Many are indulging in excesses.Masks: I have seen people keeping masks on in strange situations. A couple by themselves watching TV at home. Or a person at the wheel, with the windows panes up, the air-conditioner on, and no one else in the car. Or someone working alone in his cubicle in office. Ask yourself if it is necessary to keep the mask on in such circumstances!Gloves: The other day, an elderly man came to my chamber with woollen gloves on. I pointed that out to his grandson. He said that he had insisted on wearing those. People are going around wearing even riding gloves or cloth gloves!One has to remember that the gloves need to be of a material that can arrest the virus and can be sanitised. Wear gloves only if you are coming in contact with risky surfaces or people outside. But even the gloves need to be sanitised at regular intervals.The thumb rule is not to touch your face, even if your hands are gloved. You also need to ask yourself if it is easier to sterilise your hands rather than your gloves.Summing upThe lockdown will not stay forever but fear of corona will. Treat the world as if everyone is a Covid-19 patient except you. So it is your responsibility to deal carefully with others. Be it your friends, colleagues or family members, you have to keep yourself safe from them. If we are all careful, there is no need to fear coronavirus.Also remember, if a neighbour gets infected, do not treat him as a leper. Even if he stays next door or on a different floor in your building, the virus is not going to come out and knock on your door as long as he is staying indoors. There is no harm in calling him up to ask how he is doing and offer help with supplies. Those who misbehave with patients or medical workers who are residents of the neighbourhood have the biggest mental diseases.",2020-06-26 01:06:00
919,Mita Mukherjee,Annual fee relief at 8 schools: Archbishop - Telegraph India,"Eight unaided ICSE schools run directly by the archdiocese of Calcutta will waive half their annual fees, Reverend Thomas D’Souza, the archbishop of Calcutta, said on Thursday.No waiver will be granted on the monthly tuition fees, he said.The 50 per cent waiver on the annual fees will be granted to all students, irrespective of the financial condition of their parents.Though there is no waiver on the monthly tuition fees, some relaxation will be given to students whose parents have “genuine” difficulties in paying the fees, the archbishop said. Each such case will be examined and a decision taken.Of the eight schools run directly by the archdiocese, five are in Calcutta. They are St Aloysius Orphanage Day School, Loyola High School, St Mary’s School, Meghamala Roy Education Centre and Marian Day Centre. The remaining three are in Kharagpur in West Midnapore — Sacred Heart High School, St Joseph’s High School and Christopher Day School.The decision to offer 50 per cent relaxation on the annual fees was taken at a meeting of the education board of the archdiocese of Calcutta, held at the archbishop’s house on Thursday.“None of the archdiocese-run schools has increased students’ fees this time…. This was a part of our understanding with the state government. The government has given the directive not to increase students’ fees this year…. Today we decided to charge only 50 per cent of the annual fees. This decision was taken considering the difficulties of parents in the present situation,” the archbishop told Metro on Thursday.The archdiocese took the decision on waiving 50 per cent of the annual fee in accordance with an announcement made by the archbishop earlier this month.The archbishop had said the schools under the archdiocese would consider reducing a portion of the annual fees after the executive committee of the Bengal chapter of the Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools in India at a meeting proposed to recommend to the schools to offer some relief to parents because of the ongoing situation.After the association proposed the recommendation, the archbishop had told The Telegraph: “The association, I am told, had given some recommendations about the tuition and some other fees…. Our schools have not yet taken any decision on the recommendation. But we will definitely do that very soon. We will examine whether it is possible to consider certain fees… because on one hand we have to be sympathetic towards our parents, on the other we have to be fair to our teachers.”The archbishop is the head of all Roman Catholic churches under the Calcutta archdiocese, many of which run a number of Anglo-Indian schools in Calcutta.But decisions on all internal administrative matters of the schools are taken by the founder bodies and managing committees of the individual institutions, he said.As for the eight schools that will waive half their annual fees, the archbishop is the head of their founder bodies.",2020-06-26 02:29:00
920,Kinsuk Basu,Costlier diesel fuels demand for taxi fare hike - Telegraph India," Taxi unions have written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and transport minister Suvendu Adhikari asking for a fare hike, following a steep hike in the diesel price that has only compounded their sufferings inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic.The diesel price has gone up from Rs 65.62 a litre on June 1 to Rs 75.18 on Thursday.Officials of the transport department on Thursday met taxi operators and sought time till July 14 to arrive at a decision on revising fares. “We will hold talks with taxi operators over the next few days to understand the challenges they are facing,” an official said. The Bengal Taxi Association, one of the organisations that has written to Mamata and Adhikari, has threatened to go on strike from July 16 if the government refuses to revise fares by July 14.   “We have demanded that the existing fare of Rs 30 for the first 2km be revised to Rs 50,” said Bimal Guha of the Bengal Taxi Association. “Thereafter, the average rate of Rs 15 per km be revised to Rs 25.”The Progressive Taximen’s Union said they would wait for the government’s decision on fare hike before taking a call on whether to go on strike or not.“Let the transport minister invite representatives of all taxi operators and hear them out so that the government clearly understands our plight,” said Sambhu Nath De, the general secretary of the Progressive Taximen’s Union.     Calcutta has around 14,000 metered taxis and the demand for a fare revision has been gaining ground for some time now. In May, taxi operators had proposed a 30 per cent additional charge on metered fares. The government turned it down. The Bengal government had last revised taxi fares in 2018, fixing the starting fare, for the first 2km, at Rs 30.“The number of trips has reduced by almost 40 per cent,” said Abhishek Shaw, a taxi driver from Bhowanipore. “Besides, the diesel price is shooting up. It has never been so bad for taxi drivers.”",2020-06-26 02:33:00
921,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Old terminal of Kolkata airport to house fliers from abroad - Telegraph India,"The airport authorities have earmarked the old domestic terminal building to house fliers returning from abroad until state agencies figure out where to quarantine them, officials said on Thursday.The decision follows a fiasco over fliers from Malaysia who refused to go to any paid quarantine centre after landing at the airport around 7pm on Tuesday and, instead, headed home. The passengers, who are labourers and had no income over the past few months because of the Covid-19 pandemic, sat on the floor in the arrival section for close to seven hours before they were allowed to leave early on Wednesday.“In view of yesterday’s incident, a decision has been taken that the evacuation passengers can be kept on hold for some time inside the old domestic terminal building till the formalities of all passengers of the arrival evacuation flight are complete,” an internal communication by the airport authorities reads. On arrival at the new integrated terminal, the passengers will be transported to the old domestic terminal building by bus, escorted by the state police.The old domestic building is no longer in use. Last month, the building had been handed over to the health department for setting up of a free quarantine facility for passengers returning from abroad. The health department later took the beds away as the plan was shelved.“We have asked the state health department to take such passengers to the old domestic building and sort out the problem. If they stay in the new terminal building for several hours without maintaining social distance, it causes safety hazards,” an airport official said on Thursday.The Telegraph reported on Thursday the fiasco over 140 passengers from Malaysia and also how 143 passengers from Kyrgyzstan headed home from the airport, instead of going to a paid quarantine facility, on Friday last week.The labourers and the fliers from Kyrgyzstan, most of whom are medical students, said they had run out of money.The state government, in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus, has made it mandatory for all people returning from abroad to spend a week at a paid quarantine centre before going home.On Thursday, state government officials said they had started the process of contacting each of the 283 persons and sending them to quarantine facilities.“The police, with help of the health department, will contact each of the passengers. Necessary actions are being taken,” said a state government official. If required, he said, the passengers and their contacts will be tested for Covid-19.",2020-06-26 02:34:00
922,Our Special Correspondent,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: St Xavier’s College alumni help for 500 families - Telegraph India,"Five hundred families in the interiors of South 24-Parganas, reeling under the double blows of Covid-19 curbs and Cyclone Amphan, on Wednesday got food and other relief material that would keep them going for the next few days.The distribution camp was organised at Kharimutha village, around 7km from Kakdwip town, by St Xavier’s College (Calcutta) Alumni Association. A group of Jesuit priests, led by Father Dominic Savio, the principal of the college, went to the village to distribute the materials along with volunteers of the former students’ association.The recipients were residents of Kharimutha and two nearby villages, Mollar Chowk and Pukurberia. Five hundred people had turned up, each representing a family. The camp was organised with the help of local police.“We, the Jesuits, believe in sharing,” Father Savio said.Each family got a kit that included rice, potato, dal, soyabean, edible oil, puffed rice and biscuit. Each kit also included sanitary napkins, hand sanitisers and tarpaulin sheets.The residents of these villages were already robbed of their livelihood by the lockdown and the storm could not have hit them at a worse time. “Most of them depend on fishing and farming of betel leaves. The storm not only damaged their homes but also ravaged the farm lands,” said Sudip Singh, the officer-in-charge of Kakdwip police station who coordinated with the association to organise to camp.The former students of the Park Street college have come up with a series of campaigns in the aftermath of the lockdown and the storm to help the people. “It is our duty to stand by them at this trying time,” Father Savio said on Wednesday.“We will do our best to help people in need,” said Sanjib Koner, secretary of the former students’ association.",2020-06-26 02:48:00
923,Subhajoy Roy, Coronavirus pandemic: Post-Covid clinic to fight stigma - Telegraph India,"Doctors running a follow-up clinic at the Beleghata ID hospital for those who have recovered from Covid-19 have decided to treat such people and their family for any disease following complaints of stigmatisation.The doctors running the clinic have found that mental stress bothered those cured of Covid-19 more than any physical weakness.Complaints of stigmatisation have ranged from being refused blood tests at a laboratory once technicians got to know that the person had been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 a few weeks ago to someone being declared dead by neighbours even after getting cured and returning home.One patient even told doctors over phone that he was worried for his family members because they might not get medical treatment if the need arose. Such conversations prompted the doctors to open the clinic doors to even families of those cured of Covid-19.“The stigma of having been a Covid-19 patient is worrying those cured of the disease. Some told us over phone that they were worried about general treatment for their families,” Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, a public health specialist and the doctor who is in charge of the follow-up clinic at the Beleghata ID hospital, said.“We have told them that they can bring their family members to the clinic for any illness. We will treat them. In case we feel they need specialised care, we will refer them to speciality clinics in other government hospitals.”He cited the example of a man from Bansdroni who went to a laboratory for a routine blood test. The laboratory had drawn his blood sample when they got to know he had been admitted to hospital for Covid-19 a few weeks ago. Laboratory officials told the man his blood sample could not be tested.A police officer had to deal with mental trauma after his neighbours thought he had died. “Those cured of Covid-19 need counselling and mental support,” Bandyopadhyay said.Yogiraj Ray, an infectious disease specialist attached to the clinic, said many of those cured of Covid-19 had chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. They need regular medical care and if doctors refuse to treat them, they will be in trouble, Ray said. “We will help them deal with their chronic ailments.”The clinic now has five doctors. Besides Bandyopadhyay and Ray, the other three are Baisakhi Maji, a public health specialist; Rajsekhar Maiti, a pediatrician, and Keshab Singha Roy, a general medicine practioner who is supervising the functioning of the clinic.The clinic is not only for patients who had been admitted to the Beleghata ID Hospital. Any person cured of Covid-19 in any hospital can come here for follow-up, one of the doctors said.“The clinic is open between 11am and 2pm every Wednesday. We have already completed four weeks and 30-odd people cured of Covid-19 have visited the clinic,” Bandyopadhyay said.Among the other objectives of the clinic is to find the long-term effects of Covid-19 on a person. “The clinic will help us observe if there is any long-term effect of the medicines used to treat Covid-19 patients or for administering oxygen. If any of the patients develop any side effect, we will treat that as well,” Ray said.",2020-06-26 02:49:00
924,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: 2,251 IIEST trees beat storm - Telegraph India","The 164-year-old IIEST Shibpur has 2,610 trees on its 121-acre campus, according to a census the institute had carried out days after Cyclone Amphan had struck and uprooted many trees.Of the 2,610 trees at the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, 2,251 have been found to be alive, 281 were uprooted in the cyclone and the rest 78 are dead, a seven-member committee that conducted the census has said in its report.The report submitted to institute director Parthasarathi Chakrabarti has listed the number of every variety of trees on the campus that is next to the Indian Botanic Garden.The census was carried out as the institute was struggling to figure out the types of giant trees that had been uprooted on May 20 and to understand the scale of damage to biodiversity, an institute official said.The campus has Mango (708), Krishnachura (162), Banyan (110), Mahogany (40), Debdaru (696), Neem (128), Peepul (90), Radhachura (72), Sisham (18), Jackfruit (222), Jaam (118), Arjun (86), Jarul (64), Segun (16) and other trees (80).The committee has recommended a string of measures to take care of the trees to “preserve and enrich the ecosystem on the campus”.Horticulturist D.T. Bhutia, whom the institute had engaged to save some of the trees uprooted in the cyclone, said the trees were uprooted because of poor upkeep and the committee’s recommendation must be followed.“Most of the trees wilted following lack of regular pruning, which is a must to maintain the canopy weight; and application of nutrients and fungicide to prevent infections in the roots,” Bhutia, who is the assistant director of the horticulture wing of Central Public Works Department, said.Concreting the area around the root is also to blame because it comes in the way of the expansion of roots, deep into the soil, he said. “Removal of weeds regularly is a must.”Director Chakrabarti said: “We will hold regular consultation with horticulturists so that the recommendations of the committee can be implemented. We have been able to save some of the trees with the help of horticulturists.”Some of the uprooted trees were more than 150 years old.The Indian Botanic Garden authorities had allocated almost 21 acres on its southeast corner to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel. This had led to the birth of Bishop’s College. The institute was established in 1856.Calcutta Civil Engineering College, which was set up at the Writers’ Buildings in 1856 after spending some years at the erstwhile Presidency College, moved to the present campus as The Government College, Howrah, in 1880.Subsequently more land was acquired and the campus grew to 121 acres.A member of the committee said each tree had been given a number sequentially, followed by labelling the tree with its unique number. The date and number in month and year format has been marked on the tree.“The number has been marked in blue and the date in pink. The location of a tree has been done in two ways: locations were noted for every tree by its GPS coordinates and additionally marking a known landmark within the campus,” the member said.",2020-06-26 02:50:00

929,Sanjay Mandal,Bengal rider for evacuation flights - Telegraph India,"Bengal has asked the Centre to stop international evacuation flights to Calcutta unless it ensures passengers have booked paid quarantine facilities for themselves before boarding a flight, a move that follows instances of fliers heading home from the airport instead of a quarantine unit.Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha raised the demand in a letter he sent to the civil aviation ministry on Friday. Earlier in the day, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that the Centre would be asked to stop international evacuation flights from July 1.Sources said Sinha mentioned in the letter that the Bengal government would withdraw the no-objection certificate for international evacuation flights if the ministry did not ensure that all passengers had booked hotels for paid quarantine before boarding a flight.The state government, in an attempt to restrict the spread of Covid-19, has made it mandatory for all those flying back from abroad to spend a week at a paid quarantine unit and another week thereafter in home isolation.“Covid is increasing all over India, all over the world. But I am seeing all international flights have started. The Centre has said those who would arrive from other countries would undergo seven days’ institutional quarantine, which is pay and use. The arrangements were also made for that. But I am seeing many flights coming and (passengers) are not prevented (from heading home from the airport),” Mamata said.“Earlier, we had allowed international evacuation flights to Bengal on condition that the passengers would pre-book paid facilities and they would be allowed to board a flight after producing the documents. But that is not happening,” a senior state government official said.The chief minister said: “On the flight they are given paper on which they write the details. But after arrival, these papers are not checked. They are allowed to go. No health protocol is being followed. If this continues, how much will we control? Someone else’s irresponsible behaviour or decision or negligence will make it (Covid-19) spread in Bengal. This should not happen…. We are saying stop international flights because those who were supposed to come have already arrived. Have one flight a month, we have no objection.”Referring to the international fliers who are refusing to go to a quarantine centre, she said: “How can we track them? You are saying testing, tracking, tracing. But there is not testing, no tracking, no tracing. In Bengal, we have kept it under control but it is spreading. It cannot go on.”The Telegraph reported on Thursday about a fiasco over 143 fliers from Malaysia who refused to go to any paid quarantine centre after landing at the airport around 7pm on Tuesday and, instead, headed home. The passengers, mostly labourers who had been out of work for months because of Covid-19, sat on the floor in the arrival section for close to seven hours before they were allowed to leave.On Friday last week, all 140 passengers on a flight from Kyrgyzstan had refused to go to a paid quarantine unit and left for home.A similar scene unfolded at the airport on Thursday night, too, after an Air India flight with 157 evacuees from Kyrgyzstan landed around 9pm. The passengers, mostly medical students, refused to go to any paid quarantine unit and were finally allowed to leave around 12.30am.Later on Friday, it was decided that all evacuees would be told at the arrival area baggage carousel that they would have to book a paid quarantine unit. “It’s only after they book a paid facility that they will get customs clearance. Then they will be taken to the arrival lounge in groups of 20. If they refuse to go to a quarantine centre, police will take them there,” a government official said.Domestic flightsMamata said domestic flights from cities with a large number of Covid-19 cases would not be allowed. “We had detected a few days ago that a Covid patient from Chennai (had flown to Calcutta). He boarded the flight with Covid documents in his pocket. No test, no check-up,” she said.“So, we are saying flights from those places where the number of Corona cases is very high should not come till July 1,” she said.Mamata said she had no problems with domestic flights operating within Bengal. “I have no problem and domestic flights can operate once in 15 days. We will get tests done following the protocol.”",2020-06-27 02:52:00

Mamata made it clear that the state government would not immediately allow any fare hike and appealed to the operators of private buses and minibuses to roll out their vehicles from July 1. Thousands of private buses have been off the roads with the operators demanding a fare hike to offset the loss being inflicted by a steep rise in the diesel price and a restriction on the number of passengers a vehicle can ferry.Several operators said they would resume service but pointed out that the total bus count across the state was nearly four times the number being offered financial help. In Calcutta, the bus count stands at around 6,000, transport department officials said.The selective help, they said, “could create a rift” among operators.“Bus fares can’t be raised since we are accountable to the people. Our idea is to help people as much as possible. But we will also look after those who run buses,” Mamata said after meeting bus and minibus operators at Nabanna.“We have decided to give Rs 15,000 to each of the 6,000 buses for the next three months beginning July 1. Sudhu manusher dikey taakiye (Just keeping the concerns of the people in mind). The operators will decide how they want to utilise the amount — whether as subsidy or commission. But they will bring the buses back on the roads from July 1.”She added: “I don’t want any uncertainty among commuters whether they would be able to reach office or return home. The transport department will have to coordinate more closely with bus operators and the police to ensure that the waiting time of passengers at bus stops is reduced.”Transport minister Suvendu Adhikari has asked bus union leaders to meet him on Monday to work out the modalities of payment.     The operators told the chief minister that the rise in diesel price — up by almost Rs 10 a litre over the past 25 days — and the restriction on the number of passengers had left them struggling to meet their ends.",2020-06-27 02:58:00
931,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus pandemic: Doctor fee, Covid-19 test and PPE rates of private hospitals capped in Bengal - Telegraph India","Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced on Friday that private hospitals could not charge more than Rs 2,250 for a Covid-19 swab test and no patient could be charged more than Rs 1,000 a day for personal protection equipment.Mamata also said the state government had capped consultation fees of doctors treating Covid-19 patients at private hospitals at Rs 1,000 a day. The fee at some hospitals, she said,is as high as Rs 5,000 a day.The decision to cap fees follows complaints of overcharging by some private hospitals.The government had earlier requested private hospitals and laboratories to reduce the rate of the Covid-19 test but there was no attempt at capping it.“The test was costing Rs 4,500. We have told private hospitals that it should be done at Rs 2,250,” Mamata said on Friday.An official at a private hospital said that since the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had first capped the price at Rs 4,500, many hospitals were charging the amount. Later, ICMR asked state governments to request hospitals to reduce the rate.In Bengal, private hospitals have reduced their rates following a request from the government.“This is the first time the government is mentioning any rate for Bengal. We were charging Rs 2,500 for the Covid test. We are fine with Rs 2,250,” said Sudipto Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital.As for consultation fees of doctors treating Covid patients at private hospitals (not the ones designated as Covid treatment centres), the chief minister said: “Private hospitals were charging Rs 5,000 a day as doctor’s consultation fee. We have asked the hospitals to keep it within Rs 1,000.”The Telegraph had on June 19 reported that chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had asked officials of private hospitals to conduct the Covid-19 test at the lowest possible rate, not to overcharge patients for PPE and display the number of Covid beds available daily. On Friday, Mamata said: “Some hospitals have reduced the rates. We thank them. Some are yet to reduce. An expert team is working on restricting charges in private hospitals”.On PPE, she said: “Private hospitals can charge a patient Rs 1,000 a day for PPE.”Rupak Barua, the group CEO of AMRI Hospitals, said: “We charge what is the expense. What we are charging for PPE is to keep the hospital protected. It is also our duty to provide safety to all our healthcare personnel… administrative staff and housekeeping and security staff…. We have reduced the PPE price compared with what we were charging in April. We have been able to procure PPE at better rates and have passed on the benefit to patients.”Asked about the cap on consultation fees, an official of a private hospital said the government should keep in mind that some Covid-19 patients are treated by multiple doctors.“If a patient has co-morbidity, she/he may need consultation with a specialist. In that case, the government should allow the specialist to charge his/her consultation fee. But for someone who has no other issues, Rs 1,000 a day is fine,” the official said.Mamata said charges could be capped for some items, too.",2020-06-27 02:59:00
932,Debraj Mitra,Fishing cat ‘poisoned and killed’ in Howrah - Telegraph India,"A fishing cat, Bengal’s state animal, was poisoned and killed in a village in Howrah on June 11, animal lovers and some villagers have alleged.They said the fishing cat was pregnant and that it had been poisoned. A forest official said there was no conclusive evidence of either.More than a fortnight has passed since the carcass was found near a water body in a village in Amta Block I, around 40km from the heart of Calcutta. The forest department has so far registered a case of an “undetected offence”.Fishing cat, baghrol in Bengali, is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and included in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Killing the animal can lead to five years in jail.The June 11 incident, from Udang village in Amta Block I, was reported to the forest department by a schoolteacher. The fishing cat was found by a group of residents near a water body.Raju Sarkar, the divisional forest officer of Howrah, said the post-mortem report showed the cat had died of head injuries. “The official reason of death was trauma from cardio-respiratory failure.”Sarkar said tests did not find any “conclusive evidence” that the animal had been poisoned. Asked if it was pregnant, Sarkar said he had no such information.There has been no arrest so far, he said. “We have drawn up a case of an undetected offence.”“Some residents said the cat was pregnant and that it had been poisoned because it was feeding on fish from the water body. If the cat was pregnant then at least three more cats were killed, along with the mother,” Tiasa Adhya, a member of Human and Environment Alliance League, said.The body had injury marks on the head, indicating the animal was first poisoned and then hit on the head, Adhya said.Adhya has been researching on fishing cats in Bengal for close to a decade.A day before the Amta incident another fishing cat was trapped, killed and skinned — apparently for its meat — by some residents of a village in West Midnapore. Metro had reported that killing. Of the two suspects in the West Midnapore case, one has been arrested, a forest official said.The nocturnal animal thrives in wetlands and feeds mostly on fish. Their numbers have dwindled because of shrinking wetlands forcing them to stray into human settlements and prey on fish in ponds and livestock.The forest department has launched multiple initiatives to spread awareness about fishing cats and promote their conservation.",2020-06-27 03:00:00

The department will nurture the trees for two years from the day of plantation before handing over their custody to the civic body.The forest department, according to naturalists, is better equipped to deal with avenue plantation than the CMC and the move to involve the department in planting trees could augur well for the city.The roads where the department will plant trees are: Southern Avenue, the Rashbehari Avenue-Ruby connector, Park Street, Ballygunge Circular Road, Gariahat Road, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, EM Bypass and on stretches of Alipore.The CMC has given its nod after the department wrote to it. The decision to involve the department was taken in a meeting at the civic headquarters after Cyclone Amphan where officials of the forest and environment departments were present.“We have given our nod to the forest department. They can start planting trees along these roads,” Debashis Kumar, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators who is in charge of parks and gardens and urban forestry departments, said.Forest minister Rajib Banerjee said the department would plant trees along close to 100km of roads in Calcutta. “This is the first time that the forest department will get involved in planting trees in Calcutta on such a large scale,” Banerjee said.The department plans to plant about 5,000 trees within Calcutta, a forest official said.Thousands of trees in the city were uprooted when Cyclone Amphan struck on May 20. Some estimates have put the number of uprooted trees at over 5,000 while some have put it over 15,000.No one actually counted how many trees fell and the numbers are rough estimates, a CMC official said.A naturalist told  Metro that he expected a scientific approach in planting the trees. “Species selection is very important. If there is little space then trees that do not have a broad canopy should be planted. Also, a diverse range of trees should be planted,” he said.The forest department should ensure that the space surrounding the location of the tree is not covered with concrete paver blocks. That will allow the surface roots to expand, the naturalist said.The forest department has decided to plant a variety of trees, including Bokul, Arjun, Neem and Tabebuia rosea, an official said. The department will ensure the trees are not destroyed by cattle or human vandalism and that they are properly watered during the two years they will be in the department’s custody, the official said. “We will keep props and guards around the trees.”",2020-06-27 03:02:00
934,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: CM nudge on fees that are ‘no longer relevant’ - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday urged private schools to consider not charging fees that were “no longer relevant during the lockdown” and requested parents not to say they “wouldn’t pay any fees at all”.“I have received a letter. Some schools are charging fees in the name of computer training and laboratory facilities. Schools should not charge anything for these,” Mamata said at a news conference on Friday.“Schools are free to collect fees as they were (last year) without any increase… because you have to pay teachers, maintain schools. I agree with you on this point.“Parents have to pay fees to private schools. But I would make a request to private schools. It is true that no one has gone to schools for the past three months for any computer training. He/she has not visited the library to study. Money shouldn’t be charged under these heads.“You charge the fees that have been fixed at the start of the year. It is true that the teachers have to be paid salaries, schools have to be maintained, and gatekeepers have to be paid.”In her appeal to parents, she said it would not be proper of schools to increase fees now. “On the other hand, some are trying to play politics on the matter and saying they would not pay any fees at all. This is also not correct... because schools, too, have to pay salaries to teachers.”The government has told private schools several times not to increase fees and most schools have followed it. But parents have been demanding that schools reduce some of the fee components.Mamata spoke on the matter a day after Reverend Thomas D’Souza, the archbishop of Calcutta, said eight unaided ICSE schools run by the archdiocese of Calcutta would waive half their annual fees. “This decision was taken considering the difficulties of parents in the present situation….,” the archbishop told Metro on Thursday.Mamata said: “Let schools charge the annual fees that are required to pay teachers’ salaries…. Don’t charge students under various heads like computer training or library. There are many other components. I don’t have knowledge about all. Fees that are charged for sports. Extra fees. Don’t charge or increase extra fees under such heads now please.... If you do this, how will the common man pay? You have to run the institutions.”“Common people don’t have money. How will they pay anything extra? Everybody does not work in the government sector…. In the private sector many people have lost their jobs. Let us all behave in a humane way in this situation.”",2020-06-27 03:03:00
935,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: July HS papers cancelled - Telegraph India,"The pending papers of the higher secondary exams that students were scheduled to write on July 2, 6 and 8 have been cancelled, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Friday.Later, the president of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, Mahua Das, said: “We will take the best marks from the papers they had written before the lockdown and that would be awarded for the papers they could not write.” Das said if any examinee was not satisfied with the methodology, he or she could appear in the written test once the situation became normal. “The marks obtained in that examination will be taken into account. We are trying to publish the HS results within July,” said Das.“Whatever will be the best grades will be considered for the cancelled papers,” said an official of the HS council.“The education department has decided to cancel the exams of the pending higher secondary papers, adhering to the recommendation of an expert committee and the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education,” said Chatterjee.The announcement came a day after the CBSE and the CISCE told the Supreme Court that they were cancelling the pending papers of their Class X and XII exams because of the Covid-19 epidemic.

936,Debraj Mitra,Hint at Metro with seated passengers - Telegraph India,"Metro services may resume from July 1 if it can be ensured the trains run only with seated passengers, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday.Railway and Metro officials said they were awaiting a formal communication from the state government but had started weighing options to control the number of passengers.Metro officials said that among the Covid-19 curbs being planned were the suspension of tokens and access for only smart-card users, and ensuring crowd control right from the station gates. Metro services have been suspended since March 25.In the afternoon, the chief minister told a news conference: “We have spoken to Metro Railway. The trains can run if the seats are sanitised.... People will benefit from the resumption of Metro services.”Mamata added: “But please prevent overcrowding. Metro already has a system in place… there are automated gates. Only people with tickets can enter through the gates. So, they should look into the existing system, how to use it.“The trains can run from July 1 if social distancing is maintained, overcrowding prevented and only passengers who can be seated are allowed. We will request the public to avoid a rush.”In a video conference on Friday, Railway Board chairperson Vinod Kumar Yadav said from New Delhi in response to questions on the Metro: “We have not received any request from the state government. We will be able to take any decision after getting a request from the state government.... We will have to jointly work with the state government.”Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said the commercial services would start only after the go-ahead arrived from the railway board.“We have been coordinating with the state government. Together, we will work out the modalities, some of which are already in place,” Banerjee said.Metro officials spelled out the challenges. Before the suspension, the Metro attracted a daily average of 600,000-plus passengers. Maintaining social-distancing among even a third or fourth of that number would be daunting, officials said.“For now, we are planning to let in only smart-card users. Tokens have the risk of contamination. The number of smart-card users is comparatively low, too,” a Metro official said.An eight-coach Metro train can seat around 400-420 people. Officials said the trains may be run with a curtailed seating capacity to ensure social distancing. However, keeping track of the number of passengers will be challenging because of the multiple origin and destination points. “There are 24 stations from where people get on and off the trains. We are not equipped to keep real-time track of the smart cards swiped at every gate,” a Metro official said.Metro officials are also working on a plan to enforce crowd control at the station entrances and again at the concourses so the “platforms don’t get overcrowded”.Social-distancing needs to be maintained not only on the platforms and the trains but also in the queues at the entry points. At some stations, the floor in front of the ticket counters has already been marked to ensure people stand well apart from one another. Seating arrangements on the platforms have also been altered.The Metro used to run 288 trains every weekday before the services were stopped. “The number would probably go down,” a senior official said.",2020-06-27 04:01:00
937,Paromita Kar,Calcutta’s ageing gentlemen - Telegraph India,"Last month’s super cyclone Amphan left a trail of destruction that is not likely to be forgotten in a long time. Nature’s fury went wreaking wrath everywhere, slamming, strangling, decimating. It didn’t spare some of its own loveliest gifts to what also makes Calcutta what it is — a metropolis glorious in its abundance of trees. With thousands of them flattened — 5,500 is the estimated number — an aspect of Calcutta lies brutally bruised. And though a salvage effort was mounted in subsequent weeks — bids at reviving what could be saved, a drive to plant anew in the fatal gashes Amphan had opened — it’s unlikely the wealth wantonly laid waste will be easy to recover.The British colonisers brought with them to Calcutta new trees and planting patterns. This was in the late 18th century. And thus began to spread the canopy of mahoganies, cinchonas, casuarinas, rubber trees and hundreds others, big and small, from the womb that was the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, now called Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden. Many of these magnificent creatures exist still, and can be spotted in nooks and corners across the city. Often they are the surviving fruit of mutual care — the old guarding the old; such as the trees on the grounds of heritage institutions like the David Hare Training College, St. Lawrence’s School, Scottish Church, National Library, Victoria Memorial, Alipore court and old cemeteries.Some of them could not stand up to the marauding force of Amphan, others emerged resilient. Here’s a mixed cast of those we must mourn and some who we can still celebrate.BaobabAge: Over 100 yearsCalcutta Botanic GardensAmphan-hitThe very word baobab brings to mind something that’s ancient, stable, wise and giving. But Amphan knocked down this 100-year-old. “We are certain we will be able to revive it; it’s high on our priority,” says Basant Kumar Singh, who is the garden’s botanical assistant. A 40-tonne crane belonging to the Metro Railways has been identified for this; only its handlers are awaited. But even in its horizontal position, the baobab may be able to extract nutrition and survive, adds Singh.India has some old baobabs, although there are no written records on how this African tree arrived on our soil. “It may have come with the Arabian traders during the Mughal period when many spices and medicinal plants were introduced,” says Singh. In Africa, the baobab has long been used as a cure for female infertility. Here too, traditional medicine men began to recommend it for female infertility. Perhaps that’s why or perhaps because of its curious appearance — its bulbous trunk is full of water — it came to be regarded as a kalpataru, or heavenly tree. In many places in India, temples have sprung up beside these trees. “I saw a baobab in Allahabad that’s probably over 600 years old, and another one in Muzaffarpur of the same age... Tree stories are often passed from generation to generation, based on which one may make an assessment of time,” says the botanist.Double Coconut PalmAge: Over 126 yearsCalcutta Botanic GardensAmphan-proofPalms have pliable trunks that give them resilience. What may have also helped this heritage plant is that it is housed in an enclosure with hundreds of others. This palm, the only one in India, figures in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. It boasts of a past that may put to shame the best fiction writers.The double coconut — so named because it produces only two at a time — arrived in the garden in 1894 from the Seychelles. It has siblings in the botanic gardens of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Edinburgh and a few other places.The nuts of this palm — they are the heaviest seeds known to science — weigh 25 to 30 kilograms each. An extremely slow-growing plant, it takes about 100 years to mature. This tree began to flower in 2005-06, says Singh, which was when the scientists learnt that it is a female tree. Thus began the process of procuring male pollen.They sought help from Sri Lanka and Thailand and as luck would have it, those plants too were in the flowering phase. After government MoUs, missives and consultations, fresh pollen arrived from Sri Lanka.But pollination isn’t a simple thing — it involves complex chemistry, biology, and environmental and time factors. “For six years, scientists made several attempts at pollination and failed. Finally, in 2013, they were successful,” says an animated Singh. The fruit takes six or seven years to mature. “We harvested two coconuts this February, and stored them for future germination. Should there be a male plant, it would be a huge boon.”SundariAge: Over 100 yearsNational Library, AliporeAmphan-proofCalcutta has a few sundari trees; this one is quite a star. It is over a hundred years old with magnificent buttress roots — they prevent the tree from falling over. It survived that fatal evening of May 20, roots, branches and all.Heritiera littoralis or looking-glass mangrove is a mangrove species, the ubiquitous resident of the Sunderbans and other marshy areas. But how and when it took root here isn’t known. Maybe it simply liked the place and decided to acclimatise, quips Sukanta Biswas, who was the National Library garden superintendent for long years.In the colonial days, that whole area comprised the Belvedere Estate — all luxuriant and with just a few buildings, including the Agri Horticutural Society of India. There was a large pond full of aquatic plants to separate the compound from the city’s humdrum. There was also a canal that was part of the Hooghly water network built by the sahibs to wash the streets. Perhaps our sundari liked this proximity to water, who knows.“I’m not sure even the trees in the Sunderbans have such big buttress roots and so huge a spread,” says Biswas, fondly.When the new auditorium of the library was being built, some of its roots had to be cleared. Resistance there was — an “andolan” — to have the building built elsewhere. “But who would listen,” sighs the senior botanist. The seeds of this tree germinate while still on the parent plant and then fall. Viviparous germination, in botanical terms. Biswas planted a few of those saplings in the hope that they too will acclimatise.Krishna VatAge: Over 100 yearsCalcutta Botanic GardensAmphan-proofThat evening, this Krishna vat, or Ficus krishnae, swayed and howled — “it was unimaginably scary”, says the guard who was in the Roxbugh building 15 feet away. But this grand old gentleman emerged quite unscathed, its leaves shimmering in the sun two days later as if nothing had happened.Talking about leaves, the leaves of this Ficus are unique. There’s a little pouch-like fold at the base of the underside. The story goes that little Krishna used it to scoop out and store the butter he stole. And if caught by his mother, he would display the leaf front, with the stolen goody hidden on the other side. Some also believe that Krishna rolled it up with the butter inside, and that’s how it assumed that shape. No wonder, it’s also called Krishna buttercup or makhan katori.Records reveal that in 1896, a Calcutta man showed a branch of this tree from elsewhere to David Prain, the then director of the gardens, explaining to him why the leaf was so shaped. The enthusiastic Prain soon grew this tree in the garden from a stem cutting. He also sent a piece to the Kew Gardens in London to be grown there, while leaf specimens were sent to various experts for identification along with the stories surrounding it. A botanist in Geneva could not decide if it was a new species or a freak of nature resulting from a chance mutation. In the meantime, though, he published its name as Ficus krishnae and the name stuck. Many years later, scientists concluded that it was indeed a freak variant of Ficus benghalensis, and its name was revised to Ficus benghalensis var. krishnae.Peepal on PalmAge: Over 150 yearsScottish Cemetery, Park CircusAmphan-proofThis is actually a pair of trees in a tango, the central attraction of the 200-year-old cemetery. The host tree, a Royal Palm, is almost invisible, engulfed as it is by the roots and branches of the sacred fig, or Ficus religiosa. “The palm is about 150 years old,” says Neeta Das, conservation architect and project head appointed by the Kolkata Scottish Heritage Trust. A row of such trees was planted to decorate the resting place of the deceased Scottish members of society — soldiers, missionaries, businesspeople and so on, she adds.The tango is indeed a curious phenomenon of the plant kingdom. Ficus seeds often take root on another tree, via bird droppings. Drawing their nourishment initially from the host, they grow in size, gradually sending their roots deep into the ground. There comes a time when they choke the host to death or make it so vulnerable that it is easily felled. However, the whole process occurs at a very slow pace, over decades.“Although spared by Amphan, the palm may not survive much longer,” says Singh of the Calcutta Botanic Gardens. The peepal is fully grown and mature. “It has managed to disturb the host’s centre of gravity considerably. The palm’s trunk may have weakened from within, making the crown vulnerable,” he explains. Of course, we know that when there’s competition for nutrition, only the fittest survive.The Great BanyanAge: Over 270 yearsCalcutta Botanic GardensAmphan-hitThis iconic Ficus benghalensis is a complete forest by itself. It’s over 270 years old and spreads over 20,000 square metres. Its huge canopy is supported by around 4,000 prop roots, of which 42 to 44 were damaged by Amphan. Some of these are young while the others quite aged — 50 to 100 years old — and might have decayed anyway, says Singh. The younger ones are being restored but the older, heavier ones are difficult to move.The interlink of these roots has been disrupted but it’s only a temporary thing. Ficus trees possess great vigour and with the rainy season, it will make up for the loss it has suffered. This giant has come a long way from the time it was a sapling on a date palm. Over the years, the host died from strangulation. The banyan flourished, and how.",2020-06-28 01:31:00
938,Subhankar Chowdhury,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Two 200-year-old trees in IIEST campus back on feet - Telegraph India,"Human hands and the heavy metal of a crane have together tried to undo nature’s doing on two 200-year-old trees on the western bank of the Hooghly.On the IIEST Shibpur campus, two mahogany trees overlooking the Oval ground could not take the onslaught of Cyclone Amphan and fell. They were back on their feet on Friday evening.The two trees were planted when land for the institute was allocated in 1820 by the Botanic Garden of India and Lord Hastings served as the Governor General. Calcutta was the crown jewel of the pink empire then.Gusts of wind howling at over at 130km an hour had slammed Calcutta on May 20 — easily the fiercest storm in this neck of the woods in over a century.Storms have always taken a heavy toll on trees in Calcutta but this year was exceptional. More than 15,000 trees fell. And the human response, too, was like never before. Hundreds of trees have been replanted in Calcutta and the neighbouring districts in the past few weeks in the most concerted effort to restore quickly some of the city’s ravaged green roof.A group of horticulturists took up the job on the verge of the Oval ground in Shibpur. Leaves are expected to sprout in full in a month’s time, given the rainy monsoon the city has had, they said on Saturday.The destruction wreaked by the cyclone had “brought the attention back to the existence of the trees invaluable for their sheer history”, an IIEST official said.The chapel of the college is about five metres from the two mahogany trees. History has it that (poet, reformer) Michael Madhusudan Dutt would spend countless hours tending to the trees. He loved nature. The chapel is now named Madhusudan Bhavan.The two trees were witness to the series of events that led to the arrival of the college from the other bank of the Hooghly.A professor at the institute said Calcutta Civil Engineering College, which was set up at Writers’ Buildings in 1856 after some years at the erstwhile Presidency College, landed on the present campus as The Government College, Howrah, in 1880.Bishop’s College shifted to Calcutta when the tech school crossed over.The Botanic Garden authorities had allocated almost 21 acres on its southeast corner to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel. That land transfer led to the birth of Bishop’s College.An IIEST official said Michael Madhsudan Dutt had joined the secular department of Bishop’s College in 1844 to learn Latin, Greek and Sanskrit.“The East India Company had planted sal and teak trees apart from banyan, mahogany, walnut, peepal, gulmohar, and copper pot for ships that were then made of wood,” Bivore Das, an assistant registrar and a researcher on the history of the campus, said. “Since it was expensive to get wood from Rangoon, the trees were planted. The two trees are the oldest among the 16 mahogany varieties on the 121-acre campus.Sabyasachi Sengupta, a former registrar of the institute who had graduated from the government engineering college (the previous avatar of IIEST) in 1973, said he remembered the trees as they overlooked the Oval cricket ground, their favourite retreat outside the classroom.“The ground was developed after the college came to the campus. I can still visualise the manual scoreboard set up at a spot between the two mahogany trees and the clubhouse during our cricket matches,” Sengupta, a former professor of IIT Kharagpur, said.The ground was named the Oval by the British for its shape, just like its international counterpart at Kennington in South London.“The two mahogany trees added to the majestic view of the ground. We are happy to restore them,” Parthasarathi Chakrabarti, the director of the institute, said.Gajender Singh, one of the horticulturists said: “The monsoon has set in; the leaves are expected to come very soon.”Time will tell if man has been able to restore what nature had almost taken away.",2020-06-28 02:11:00
939,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus pandemic: Bengal higher education department's final semester plan - Telegraph India,"The Bengal higher education department has told universities that final-year students will be assessed in their terminal examination by factoring in 80 per cent “on the basis of best aggregate percentage obtained by the candidate in any of the previous semester/year’s results and 20 per cent on the internal semester during the current semester/year”.The advisory, issued on Saturday evening and circulated among vice-chancellors, says in case of an undergraduate student, the best aggregate in the last five semesters has to be considered.“In case of a postgraduate student, the best aggregate in the last three semesters has to be considered,” said an official.The universities have been asked to declare the “final year/semester results preferably within July 31”.If a student wishes to appear in a formal examination instead of the alternative method as has been spelt out in the advisory, he or she will be given an opportunity to apply for the exam through a process to be notified by the university concerned, another official said. “However, the exam should be conducted only after the situation gets normal and the result of the special exam may be published within one month of the exam,” he said.The advisory has prompted Jadavpur University to convene a meeting of its examination board next week.In engineering, the university had announced on June 12 that students would be assessed factoring in 30 per cent weightage from the previous semester (best aggregate) and the rest through internal assessment (home assignment). In arts, one of the two assessment parameters had said students would be graded factoring in 60 per cent weightage from the previous semester (best aggregate) and the rest through internal assessment (home assignment).Pradip Ghosh, a JU pro-VC, said: “We have got the advisory and the university will take steps it deems necessary.”The department has said that the students for the intermediate semesters/years would be promoted to the next semester/year.",2020-06-28 02:14:00
940,Tapas Ghosh And Mita Mukherjee,Calcutta High Court stays teacher transfer clause - Telegraph India,"The high court on Friday stayed the operation of a clause of the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Act, 2017, which allows the government to transfer state-aided schoolteachers for administrative reasons.The interim order, for now, takes away the school education department’s right to transfer a teacher without her/his consent.In the same order, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharya stayed the transfer of four teachers from the state-aided Satashi High School, Jagachha, Howrah, to schools in other districts.Four teachers of the school had moved court after they got transfer orders on June 4 and were released by the school managing committee within two days in the middle of the lockdown. The amendment to the school service commission act in 2017 empowered the government to transfer a state-aided schoolteacher or an employee to a similar institution against any sanctioned post “in the interest of public service for administrative reasons”.The objective of the amendment was to enable the government to maintain a proper teacher-student ratio across its 14,000-odd secondary schools by transferring surplus staff from one institution to another with a shortfall.Before the amendment, transfers of state-aided schoolteachers and employees were based on the concept of “mutual and general” ones. In a mutual transfer, two teachers could swap schools if both had similar qualifications and experience.In a general transfer, a teacher wanting to move to another state-aided school had to file an application. The transfer was allowed only if there was a suitable vacancy in that particular institution.Staying the amendment on Friday, the judge held that the new legislature was ultra vires to the Constitution as the service condition at the time of recruiting the four teachers did not include a provision by which they could be transferred citing administrative reasons.Ekramul Bari, who appeared for Debabrata Kanji and three other teachers, said the transfer decision was “vindictive”. There cannot be any administrative reason to transfer the four teachers as the decision has been taken when all education institutions are closed because of Covid-19, Bari said.Advocate general Kishore Datta, who appeared for the government, told the court that the amendment intended to improve the academic standard of state-aided schools by rationalising the distribution of teachers and other staff.The judge asked Datta to file an affidavit in opposition and announced that the matter would be heard in detail later.",2020-06-28 02:23:00
941,Snehal Sengupta,Passengers from Bangladesh chased and quarantined after landing at Calcutta airport - Telegraph India,"Several people who arrived in the city from Bangladesh on Saturday played cat and mouse with police at the airport terminal to avoid going to a quarantine facility.A US Bangla Airlines flight with 164 evacuees on board arrived at the Calcutta airport from Dhaka in the morning. Most of the passengers — mostly labourers without work for months because of Covid-19 — refused to go to any quarantine centre and wanted to return home.Cops first pleaded with them and then gave chase with raised batons after many tried to make a run for it. They managed to catch those who tried to run away and put them on two buses that took them to a government-run quarantine centre off the Bypass.The government, in an attempt to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, has made it mandatory for all those flying back from abroad to spend a week at a paid quarantine centre and a week thereafter in home isolation.“We decided to deploy a strong police contingent to ensure people follow quarantine rules. The quarantine protocol is being followed across the country and we can’t be an exception and allow people to return home putting others at risk,” J. Mercy, deputy commissioner, airport, the Bidhannagar commissionerate, said.The Telegraph was present at the airport when the Bangladesh flight landed. A group of passengers stepped out of the building, arguing loudly with cops and government officials. They sat on the floor once officials told them that they could not be allowed to return home.A few men in their late 20s tried to make a dash for it through the crash barriers and were chased by RAF personnel and an officer who caught up with them before they could breach the holding area.The Telegraph had reported on Saturday that Bengal had asked the Centre to stop international evacuation flights to Calcutta unless it ensured passengers had booked paid quarantine facilities for themselves before boarding a flight.The move followed instances of fliers heading home and not a quarantine unit from the airport.This newspaper had written on Thursday about a fiasco over 143 fliers from Malaysia who refused to go to any paid quarantine centre after landing at the airport around 7pm on Tuesday and instead headed home.The passengers, who were mostly labourers without work, had sat on the floor in the arrival section for close to seven hours before being allowed to leave.On Friday, it was decided that all evacuees would be told to book a paid quarantine unit and would be taken to the arrival lounge in groups of 20.“The fact that smaller groups of fliers were brought out in phases ensured we could easily put them on buses though most did not want to go to a quarantine unit,” an airport official said.A flight from the US landed at the airport on Saturday afternoon while another carrying stranded Indians from Hong Kong landed at night, the official said.Last week, all 140 passengers on a flight from Kyrgyzstan had refused to go to a paid quarantine unit and left for home. A similar scene had unfolded at the airport on Thursday night, too, after an Air India flight with 157 evacuees from Kyrgyzstan landed around 9pm. The passengers, mostly medical students, refused to go to any paid quarantine unit and had to be allowed to return home.",2020-06-28 02:24:00

943,Monalisa Chaudhuri,"Bikers in mask pose as cops, rob elderly women - Telegraph India","At least four elderly women were robbed of their gold ornaments in the past 48 hours and police believe two men on a motorcycle wearing masks and posing as cops were involved in the robberies.The two have been posing as cops and telling women on roads “it is risky to wear gold jewellery during the lockdown” and asking them to take off the ornaments, the police said.In each of the four cases, reported in Entally, Shyampukur, Lake Town and in the Airport area on Thursday and Friday, the men had stopped the women walking alone and introduced themselves as police officers. They had offered the women a white paper and asked them to take off their ornaments and kept the package in their bags. But while keeping it, they replaced it with an identical package of costume jewellery, the police said.In all the four cases, the women realised they had been cheated and robbed only after reaching home. They lost gold bangles, earring, and a gold chain, the police said.The men have been caught on CCTV footage of the places where the women had been targeted but they had their faces covered in masks and were wearing caps, the police said. The CCTV grabs have been circulated across all police stations in Calcutta and in the Bidhannagar commissionerate’s jurisdiction.“The description and modus operandi of the men matches with that of the members of the Irani gang. These men spoke in Hindi and broken Bengali. They were tall and well built… they used the same way to cheat and rob old people walking alone on roads just like the Irani gang,” an officer in Lalbazar said.The Irani gang was active in Bowbazar, Girish Park, Hare Street and Burrabazar a few years ago. Members used to pose as cops. Investigations had then revealed that multiple gangs from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh had operated in Calcutta in a similar way in the past.The gang chose their target, considering the fact the elderly are more vulnerable during the pandemic and it is easier to confuse them citing the lockdown, the police said.“If someone poses as a police officer and tells an elderly person on the road that it is unsafe to wear gold jewellery because roads are deserted during the lockdown, chances are they will get scared and listen to the advice. This gang utilised this opportunity,” an officer said.The police are collecting more CCTV footage to get a picture of the motorcycle’s number plate.",2020-06-28 02:31:00
944,PTI,Kolkata: Zomato employees burn company T-shirts to protest Chinese investment in firm - Telegraph India," A group of Zomato food delivery platform employees in Calcutta tore and burnt their official T-shirts to protest Chinese investment in the firm.The agitation comes in the backdrop of the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley on June 15.During the protest at Behala in the southwestern part of the city on Saturday, some agitators claimed they have quit their jobs as Zomato has a sizeable Chinese investment and urged people to stop ordering food via the company.In 2018, Ant Financial, a part of Chinese major Alibaba, had invested USD 210 million in Zomato for a 14.7 per cent stake. The food delivery major recently raised an additional USD 150 million from Ant Financial.""Chinese companies are making profits from here and attacking the Army of our country. They are trying to grab our land. This cannot be allowed,"" one of the protesters said.",2020-06-28 11:07:00
945,Jhinuk Mazumdar,How some Calcutta schools are cutting costs  - Telegraph India,"A number of city schools are trying to cut costs to remain financially viable at a time when they are not getting fees and finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds for additional expenditure.Reducing the number of buses, discontinuing digital classrooms and putting on hold plans to update the IT infrastructure are among the measures schools are taking to curb expenses.Sri Sri Academy, for instance, has decided to reduce its bus fleet by half. Chowringhee High School has discontinued its digital classroom contract, as part of which it has to pay an agency every quarter.Sushila Birla Girls’ School has suspended its IT-related upgrade this year, marking a break with the annual practice of replacing or upgrading some of its computers.A school in Salt Lake has not renewed its contract with the nurses, who take care of the children when needed.“We had written to the parents asking them who would want to avail themselves of the bus service when the school reopens. Only 25 per cent of the parents responded. We have decided to discontinue routes where parents have not responded because the school cannot maintain the expenses of the buses not knowing whether parents would still be interested in the service,” said Suvina Shunglu, the principal of Sri Sri Academy.Schools are not sure about when children will be back on the campus for regular classes and hence do not want to keep making investments that are not needed now.“The digital classroom is an important teaching aid for all classes from Class I to XII but we had to take steps to cut costs. Only five per cent of our parents have paid the fees so far,” said Perminder Dasani, the administrator of Chowringhee High School.Many schools have not been receiving fees from parents. In some cases the fees received are dismal, leaving the authorities struggling to run the institutions.Some of the institutions that have not yet decided to curtail costs said they, too, might do so.“We will have to cut down on the non-recurring costs that can be kept on hold till classes in the school resume,” said G.V. Subramanian, the secretary and director of Bhavan’s Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir.Schools said some of the costs would anyway get reduced because sports or concerts are unlikely to be held this year. A large amount of money is spent on hiring a stadium or an auditorium for sports or a concert.Despite that schools are taking steps to ensure there is no “extra burden” on them.“We have to upgrade our IT-related infrastructure to keep the system current. In fact, we usually have to change a set of computers in the labs that do not function properly, but all of that has been put on hold. We also had plans to upgrade the tablets that we give to our children in the classroom. That has been put on hold, too,” said Sharmila Bose, the principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School.Several schools that would keep adding services or products have put most investments on hold.Throughout the year, and especially towards the beginning of the session, vendors approach schools for various kinds of products such as e-books and other digital products, and assessment tools.“This time, too, there are proposals for new services or products. We would have considered them in normal circumstances, but this year we do not want to add to the financial burden on the school,” said Amita Prasad, the director of Indus Valley World School.",2020-06-29 03:00:00
946,Debraj Mitra,Traffickers eye recharge stores for numbers - Telegraph India,"Mobile recharge stores in Canning have been seeing a surge in visitors during the lockdown but not everyone is coming to recharge their phones.Many men are trying to get access to the log book where the store owner lists the phone numbers of the customers — many minor girls among them. An innocuous missed call or a random friendship message is often the starting point of an operation that lands minor girls in outstation brothels, said police and rights activists.The suspension of trains has temporarily restricted inter-state trafficking but traffickers are still active, especially in South and North 24-Parganas. “Almost every girl has a phone. The traffickers are trying to tap as many contacts as they can while waiting for the train service to resume. The lockdown has made traffickers pro-active in looking for more and more contacts,” said Amina Laskar, a member of Bansra Birangana Seba Samiti, a South 24-Parganas-based organisation that works with schoolgirls to spread anti-trafficking awareness and also works for counselling and rehabilitation of trafficking survivors.According to the police, several girls rescued from brothels said they had come in contact with traffickers by responding to missed calls or messages.In many cases, the caller befriends the girl before calling her on a “date”. The area is usually near a railway station. A spiked drink or food is offered to the unsuspecting teenager. When she opens her eyes, she finds herself either on a long-distance train or another city.“Many homes do not have a TV, but a phone is much cheaper. Increased internet penetration is also being used by traffickers. A random call or message is the most common ploy. Facebook and WhatsApp are also being used to lure girls,” said Munmun Chowdhury, the officer-in-charge of the women's police station in Canning, a hotbed of trafficking. Two minor girls from North 24-Paragans’ Basirhat were rescued from a house in Gujarat a couple of days ago, the district police said. They were befriended by two youths and trafficked to Gujarat just before the lockdown.“Often, the offer of a decent job does the trick for traffickers,” said Sambhu Nanda, who works with Partners in Anti-Trafficking, an alliance of NGOs in North 24-Parganas.“Some men are giving a bundle of notes to a girl’s family in the garb of help. At the opportune moment, the giver will ask for a return of the cash. If the girl’s father cannot, he will ask for the girl’s hand,” said Pompi Banerjee, a social worker with Sanjog. “The traffickers are doing their homework now. The test will start once the trains start running.”",2020-06-29 03:01:00
947,Our Special Correspondent,"Suicide after severe pain, dad too dies of shock - Telegraph India","A 60-year-old man was found hanging at his home early on Sunday, hours after doctors at a government hospital, where he went with severe leg pain, allegedly told him to go to another hospital as no orthopaedic was available.The man’s 90-year-old father became unconscious on seeing his son hanging and was declared dead later in the day.Police said Gopal Mandal, 60, was found hanging from the ceiling of a room at his Darapara home in Haridevpur.Gopal’s wife Jhuma said her husband — a rickshaw van-puller by profession — had suffered fracture in a leg many years ago. A metal plate had to be inserted to repair the fracture and it was not taken out. “My husband was suffering from an excruciating pain in that leg. On Saturday, we took him to a government hospital, where he was given an injection and then asked to wait. After an hour, we were told that the doctor in the orthopaedic department would not come and we should go elsewhere. We decided to return home because we could not afford to get him treated at a private hospital and there was also the fear of coronavirus infection,” Jhuma said.Early on Sunday, Gopal’s pain intensified and he was last seen going to the washroom. When he failed to return to his room after some time, family members went to look for him and found him hanging in a store room. Jhuma said her father-in-law Bhootnath Mandal passed out on seeing his son in that condition. When he was taken to hospital, he was declared dead.Police said they had not received any complaint of medical negligence from Gopal’s family. Gopal, who was the only earning member of the family, had left behind two children.",2020-06-29 03:14:00

The woman’s husband and her mother-in-law are admitted to a private hospital in Jadavpur.Residents of the building, who relented after police intervened, also allegedly threatened to stop water supply to the woman’s flat. None of them is said to have agreed to be the family’s caregiver, a mandatory requirement if a person infected by the coronavirus wants to stay in home isolation.A man from the locality finally came forward to be the caregiver and is providing the woman and her son with medicines and other essentials. Members of a neighbourhood club called on the woman and asked her to get in touch with them if she needed any help.The woman’s husband, who works for a private blood bank, had gone to the Sundarbans several times recently to distribute relief to victims of Cyclone Amphan. He had fever and he tested positive for Covid-19 on June 23. The next day, his 77-year-old mother, wife and son tested positive, too.“My husband had to be admitted to hospital because he was running a high temperature. My mother-in-law was admitted because of her age,” the woman said on Sunday.Health department officials visited their house and said the woman and her son could stay in home isolation because they were asymptomatic.“Other residents of the building told us that we could not stay at home and should get admitted to a hospital. Some said they might lose their jobs if their employers came to know that they shared an apartment block with two persons infected by the coronavirus. A few even threatened to stop water supply to our flat,” the woman told Metro over the phone.The family then contacted the police.A team from Behala police station reached the building and talked to the other families there. The residents finally agreed to let the woman and her child stay in their apartment.“There is fear in many people’s minds about Covid-19. We had to explain what home isolation is to the residents and they finally agreed to let the woman and her son stay,” said Mohammed Irshad, a sub-inspector of Behala police station who visited the building.“I requested members of all five families we share the building with to sign a form and agree to be our caregiver. But none was willing,” the woman said. Finally, she contacted a man who stays nearby and he agreed to be the caregiver.“The family was our neighbour 10 years ago. When the woman told me she needed someone who could deliver essentials at her doorstep, I readily agreed,” said Subhasish Guha, who works for a private firm. “My wife and daughter supported my decision. I am taking all precautions.”Tarun Kayal, the secretary of the club that has assured the woman of help, said: ”Initially, some members were reluctant to visit their home but we told them we would not be infected if we maintained social distancing and took other precautions. We asked the woman to call us if she needed any help.”",2020-06-29 03:15:00

The prosecutions were part of a “special night drive” conducted jointly by the traffic police and officers of police stations. “Such drives are conducted in pockets of the city every night, but this was the first drive held on such a big scale since the lockdown curbs were relaxed,” an officer said.The drive was conducted between 10pm and 11pm on Saturday at major intersections.Last Friday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that the lockdown restrictions would be in force from 10pm to 5am, instead of from 9pm to 5am.On Saturday night, officers of all 25 traffic guards prosecuted 378 motorists and officers of police stations in the nine divisions prosecuted 323 people for violating lockdown restrictions.“A large number of motorists were prosecuted for speeding, riding without a helmet and riding with more than one pillion rider,” an officer of the traffic department said.“Those who were prosecuted by officers of police stations failed to give any satisfactory reply when asked why they were out post-10pm,” an officer said. “Only people associated with essential services and those who can cite an emergency are allowed to be out on the roads at night.”A senior officer said such drives will be conducted periodically for effective implementation of the night curfew.",2020-06-29 03:17:00
950,Kinsuk Basu,Decision for cycling bays in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Several roads of Calcutta will have bays earmarked for cyclists, the state government has decided.The urban development department has engaged a Faridabad-based consulting firm to conduct a preliminary survey of some thoroughfares of Calcutta where a bay can be created for cyclists. The agency will measure the arteries’ width and their traffic load and pattern throughout the day before drawing up a blueprint of how the bays can be created. “The agency will start working on July 1 and draw up a preliminary blueprint by 15th. Officials of the transport department, Calcutta police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will then meet to discuss the blueprint,” said an official of the CMDA.Urban development minister Firhad Hakim met officials of the CMDA and representatives of the consulting agency on Saturday to discuss the nitty-gritty of the project, aimed at promoting environment-friendly mode of transportation in Calcutta.Urban development department officials said the agency had been tasked with two things. First, it will draw up a detailed plan on how to create cycling bays and how many thoroughfares are suitable for the creation of such bays. And then, it will suggest how to encourage more and more people to cycle to work and help reduce the city’s carbon footprint.“Once the policy is drawn up, the urban development department will place it before the cabinet to issue an ordinance,” an official said.Commuters are facing a tough time in Unlock 1 as only a handful of private buses are on the roads. Officials said that after hearing about the commuters’ plight, chief minister Mamata Banerjee felt the need to create space for cyclists across Calcutta.On June 9, Mamata had said the government had approved a policy of allowing bicyclists on all small and medium roads in Calcutta and other major urban areas in an attempt to ease the inconvenience faced by commuters in reaching office in the absence of Metro and local trains.She had also instructed Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma to issue a notification mentioning the roads on which bicyclists would be allowed. Lalbazar has since allowed cyclists only on certain lanes and bylanes.“Once the transport department, CMC and the Calcutta police have cleared the blueprint, the consulting firm will come up with a full report within four months on creation of cycling bays in Calcutta,” the CMDA official said. “Based on this, a final detailed project report will be drawn up.”Calcutta has witnessed a rise in the number of cyclists since Unlock-1 started on June 1 with many commuters pedalling down several kilometres to reach offices in the central business district and parts of south Calcutta. Once dedicated bays are created along certain roads, CMAD officials said, the number of cyclists will go up further.",2020-06-29 03:17:00

952,Debraj Mitra,Dry ration for 60 visually impaired persons in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Sixty people with visual impairment, out-of-work because of the lockdown, got a few days’ dry ration from two NGOs on Saturday.Many of the recipients used to sell different items on local trains in the Sealdah North section.The distribution of ration was held at several pockets in north Calcutta and North 24-Parganas — Dum Dum, Baguiati, Madhyamgram, Barasat, Duttapukur and Habra, among others. A similar drive was held on the southern fringes earlier this month.Shibnath Bera, one of the recipients of ration, sells chanachur on local trains on the Sealdah-Bongaon line. “I have been living on support from NGOs for the past two months. My savings lasted till the middle of April,” said the 50-year-old resident of Duttapukur in North 24-Parganas. His wife is visually impaired, too.Bera leads an amateur theatre group comprising people with various degrees of visual impairment. No one now calls the group for shows because of the lockdown.On Saturday, each recipient got a kit containing rice, daal, potatoes, oil, soybeans and biscuits. A pair of masks was given to each recipient, too.“We will try to provide livelihood support to these people,” said Romen Ningthoujam, a representative of Goonj, the NGO that provided the kits.The recipients were selected by The Society For The Welfare Of The Blind, a non-profit that works for the uplift of people with visual impairment. It runs a home for students in Ranaghat, in Nadia district, and pays monthly stipends to over a dozen female students.“Once train services resume, we plan to buy some stuff for the hawkers to sell in the initial phase,” said Biswajit Ghosh, the secretary of The Society For The Welfare Of The Blind and principal of the Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy in Narendrapur.The NGO gave Rs 300 to each recipient.",2020-06-29 03:50:00
953,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya,Adventures of the tea ambassador - Telegraph India,"The first flush from Darjeeling comes in March. It is a light, bright aromatic tea, and the young leaves are delicately plucked. The second flush, from the second foliage, comes in May. It is mellow and full of flavour. It is followed, kind of on tiptoe, briefly, by the Muscatel, mellow and sweet, its arrival signalled by a flower that blooms in the hills.Then comes autumn flush, delicate, aromatic. The season closes with winter flush, a brief, final event.This could be the Seven Ages of Man, the tea leaf version, and one can spend an entire life looking at tea. Dolly Roy, 66, has done that.Roy needs no introduction to many Calcuttans, but for those not in the know, she is the person behind Dolly’s, The Tea Shop, in Dakshinapan, the open-air shopping complex in Dhakuria in south Calcutta. The tea shop is a Calcutta landmark and when the city is cooped up indoors, you long for it.You long for Dakshinapan, too, and the smell of handmade cotton fabric: in Gurjari, Lepakshi, Mriganayani. And the touch of cloth. And the colours. And the sour salespersons, quite untouched by the processed vocabulary of a department store executive. And the aimless wandering, and some useless, some useful buying, and the pilgrimage ending at Dolly’s, where you plonk yourself down on one of the chairs outside caressed by the potted palm fronds, or walk into the shop itself, dense with paper lanterns and pictures and soft low seats and tea chests everywhere, stacked up, or on the floor, and the buzz of everyone talking, and you begin to get used to a calm frenzy that permeates the air, and want to order the tea. The elaborate menu comes with every variety — black, green, white, hot and iced, Darjeeling, Uttaranchal, Assam, first flush, second flush… you feel dizzy once more, and settle for the old favourite: lemon barley tea.If you are with a friend, it is very likely that now you also get into a slow, whispered conversation that will eventually change your life. There’s something about Dolly’s, where Roy, widely referred to as the first woman tea-taster of India, herself gently guided the uninitiated through the menu, even as the matronly women who look after the customers exude a benign indifference that is 100% Calcutta. Dolly’s introduced to the city not only the pleasures of the tea that were once only an elite preserve, but also a place for conversations, and the two blend perfectly.The shop started in 1988, the year Dakshinapan, a Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) project, was also inaugurated. And all these years, Roy has been there at the shop, seated in the left-hand corner in front of the counter, a handsome woman with kohl eyes, statement bindi and a grand presence, presiding over everything and somehow giving the impression of being throned.Roy could not attend the shop the last two years because of her ill health. It was a little disconcerting to see the shop without her. Seeing her at her Lake Gardens apartment, which has a touch of the tea shop in it, also takes a little bit of an adjustment: it is difficult to imagine her outside the store. She looks graceful in a white salwar kameez, though a little tired as she is recovering from a surgery, but as effervescent as ever.Her life has been extraordinarily eventful.Her association with tea began by chance, when she was still very young. “I don’t remember all the dates any more,” she says. She began to work with the Tea Board around 1970 and was first in Mumbai, then called Bombay, working at Tea Centre in Churchgate, a tea room of great colonial charm.So began her education in tea, which would later make her a leading Indian tea-taster and also an adviser on tea manufacturing. But the only connection she had with tea earlier was Darjeeling, where she had studied at Loreto Convent school. Both her parents were doctors in Calcutta.What does it take to understand tea, other than a deep interest, patience and instinct, which are a tall order by themselves? A very fine, clean palate. “A tea-taster cannot drink or smoke,” says Roy.Just a few months after she landed in Bombay, something happened that changed her life again. In 1972, she was chosen to go to the US as an “ambassador of tea”. “I didn’t even have a passport!” she says. And she was not yet 20.But she did go, and toured 69 US cities, with the US Tea Council. “I was extremely nervous,” she said. She must have done well — she appeared on television too, “the only platform for advertisement then”. She would be accompanied by a woman working for the US council.“The idea was to build up the image of Indian tea,” says Roy. She got a second stint of ambassadorship, in Europe. She would go around in a huge van and travel to cities in different countries. It was an exhilarating time, unusual for an Indian woman then.After five years abroad, she returned to India and worked with a tea-broking firm. As with her career in tea, chance led her to the tea shop. From a conversation at a Puri beach she learnt about space available at Dakshinapan, had to wait for the entire day at a bank the day her loan was sanctioned, and finally set up Dolly’s, palm-fringed and with the white-and-sea green striped awning.That was 32 years ago. Her work turned into a gift for the city.Now she does not know when she will reopen the store, or how. But she has a few plans. She would also like to write her memoirs one day, she says.",2020-06-29 03:51:00

958,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Lockdown: Foreign liquor bottles seized from Calcutta spa - Telegraph India,"At least 200 bottles of foreign liquor were seized from a closed spa near Ballygunge on Tuesday. They were to be sold to a “select clientele” at triple the MRP, the excise department has said.The seizure by the department’s Calcutta (south) wing indicates bootleggers are trying to make a fast buck during the lockdown.The bottles of wine and whisky is worth around Rs 15 lakh, an excise department official said. Some from the stock have been sold at close to triple the MRP, the official said.The seized bottles will be kept at the department’s central godown in Muchipara till they are produced in court as exhibits during trial. A sealed sample from among the seized bottles will be sent to the department’s chemical examiner to check for its authenticity, the official said. After such cases are disposed of, the department generally auctions the bottles and the money raised goes to the excise exchequer, the official said.The lockdown on non-essential services, including the sale and distribution of liquor across the state, has left many people searching for liquor, even at a higher cost.Initially, many had stocked bottles at home and even sought help from friends. But now, many have started looking for illegal means to get a taste of their drink.“It is embarrassing to go to a friend’s place daily and there are so many restrictions on roads as well. I cannot tell cops that I am going to a friend’s place for a drink,” a bank official who lives in the Bhowanipore area said. “So, it is indeed a very tough situation for people like me.”The excise department has arrested the spa owner, Anil Jaiswal. “The spa was operational till before the lockdown. Now, it is being used as a godown to store liquor bottles,” another excise department official said.Jaiswal apparently supplied liquor to a select few. He fell in the excise department’s trap when officials “penetrated” his client base and requisitioned several bottles, which he was about to sell at four times the MRP, the official said.Jaiswal and his team had been arrested last year for illegal stock and sale of foreign liquor from his godowns on  Sudder Street and in pockets of south Calcutta, an official said.Excise officials said the seized bottles had been illegally procured from duty-free shops in the port area.“The rule says two litres of foreign liquor can be bought against one passport. If someone possesses foreign liquor in bulk without being able to disclose its source, it indicates a racket,” the official said.",2020-07-04 20:57:00

So, we requested them to execute this project,” said the officer-in-charge of Patuli police station, Soumo Thakur. Six such illustrations have been made — at the Ganguly Bagan crossing, Baghajatin crossing, in front of KK Das College and Welland Goldsmith School, at the Patuli police station crossing and at the Patuli-Bypass crossing. They are the outcome of a collaboration between Calcutta police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Three more locations, which usually remain busy and are prone to violation of the lockdown, have been selected for illustrations, local councillor Bappaditya Dasgupta said.",2020-07-04 20:57:00
961,Jayanta Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Green board guidline on medical waste - Telegraph India,"The Central Pollution Control Board has issued a revised guideline about management of biomedical waste linked to Covid-19, outlining roles of urban local bodies and state pollution control boards in handling and treatment of waste generated by those quarantined at home.Municipalities and municipal corporations have been mandated to collect medical waste from homes where suspected coronavirus cases are quarantined, in yellow bags and hand them to biomedical waste management facilities.The guideline — issued by the member secretary of the central board, Prashant Gargava — has been sent to all Union and state-level departments concerned, state pollution control boards and civic bodies.A senior official of the board said they had to issue the revised guideline because biomedical waste related to home quarantine was not being collected in most municipal areas across the country. This despite an earlier guideline on the matter issued by the central board about three weeks back.According to public health professionals, biomedical waste generated by those in home quarantine can potentially be a source of infection if it is not disposed of properly.The latest guideline says civic bodies should “create a separate team of workers who shall be engaged in door-step waste collection”. The workers should be trained in collecting such waste and given dedicated vehicles.None of the civic bodies in Bengal has started collecting biomedical waste linked to home quarantine.“We are yet to initiate the process. We will look into the revised guideline and try to act accordingly,” Debabrata Majumdar, the mayoral council member in charge of waste management at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation told Metro on Monday evening.According to the state health department, 43,104 people were in home quarantine as of Tuesday. Experts observe that even if a small fraction of them happens to be infected with the coronavirus, inappropriate management of biomedical waste generated by them can prove disastrous.“Biomedical waste comprises used masks, gloves, tissues and cotton, medicine leftovers and any other materials disposed of. Unless the waste is collected separately and incinerated, the risk of infection from those items remains high,” said Utpal Chattapadhyay, the director of the All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health.“The risk increases many times if such waste gets mixed with normal waste,” said Arunava Majumdar, a scientist formerly with the institute of hygiene and public health.“We are looking into it,” a health department official said.",2020-07-04 20:58:00
963,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus: Lockdown counsellors for Xavier's students - Telegraph India,"St Xavier’s College has appointed three psychological counsellors who will help students cope with anxiety and depression resulting from the lockdown.Students will be able to contact the counsellors through email or by phone and seek their help if they are going through any mental health problem because of the 21-day nationwide lockdown, Father Dominic Savio, the principal of St Xavier’s College, said.“We are under lockdown. Many are worried about the uncertain future. Some students may be experiencing anxiety and helplessness. The counsellors can offer some guidance to the students on how to manage their mental health problems during this period,” the principal said.Students will not have to pay anything for the service.Many students, especially those who are in the final year and are planning to join institutes in other states or abroad for higher studies, are worried about their future.Students from all sections of society study at the college. The uncertainty caused by the lockdown can impact those from economically backward families.“The need of the hour for all of us is to stay calm and composed in this unprecedented crisis. We want to be equipped with a facility that would help all sections of students deal with the crisis,” the principal said.The college has initially appointed three counsellors to guide the students. But more can be engaged if the demand increases, Father Savio said.Details of the counsellors such as their phone numbers and the time and days when the students can contact them are available on the college website. All three counsellors will not be available on all days.Students are also being guided about the various links on mental health provided by the Union ministry of health and family welfare for mental and psychological support.",2020-07-04 20:59:00
964,Sanjay Mandal And Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Roster for doctor re-deployment in Bengal - Telegraph India,"The state health department is preparing a list of doctors, nurses and other medical professionals across government-run hospitals who can be deployed in the health-care units reserved for Covid-19 patients, officials said on Tuesday.“Physicians, pulmonologists and anaesthetists are needed to treat coronavirus patients with moderate to severe symptoms. There will also be a lot of patients with mild symptoms. For them, the government is planning to prepare a pool of doctors from every field,” said an official of the health department.Bengal has 59 dedicated hospitals for coronavirus patients.The doctors who will run surveillance on patients with mild symptoms “can be from any discipline such as general surgery and pharmacology”, the official said. If the condition of any patient with mild symptoms turns critical, he or she will be shifted to a better centre and will remain under the care of a specialist.“There are not enough specialists in government hospitals. It may not be possible to deploy pulmonologists and anaesthetists for all patients if the number rises significantly. So, doctors from other fields are being brought in,” the official said.The number of patients admitted at most hospitals across Bengal that are not designated for Covid-19 treatment has reduced significantly since the lockdown was announced. The number of inpatients at most such hospitals is a third of the usual count, health department officials said.The decision to redeploy doctors in the government health sector for treatment of Covid-19 patients has been taken following a recommendation from a task force of doctors formed by chief minister Mamata Banerjee.“Some doctors have already been redeployed to Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital, one of the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Calcutta. A list is being prepared to redeploy more such doctors,” an official said.Health department officials said that according to the protocol of treatment of coronavirus patients, there will be three specialist doctors for every 50 beds and one for every 10 beds thereafter.If a coronavirus hospital has 200 beds, it will have 18 specialist doctors — three for 50 beds and one for every 10.“According to data available from across the world, 55 to 60 per cent coronavirus patients have mild symptoms. Between 15 and 20 per cent have moderate symptoms and around 10 per cent suffer from severe symptoms. We have classified the treatment centres on those lines,” the official said.According to initial plans, doctors from hospitals near the ones designated for Covid treatment will be drafted into the scheme. The government is also making arrangements for accommodation of doctors, nurses and technicians if they are brought from other districts or towns, said officials.Each coronavirus hospital,  in addition to the critical care gadgets they already have, will have additional four ventilators — including one with a bi-pap machine and a mobile ventilator — to be allocated by the government.The private hospitals, too, are preparing a roster of doctors for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “We have made a roster for three sets of doctors and nurses. Each set is being sent to home quarantine for two weeks by turn,” said the CEO of a private hospital.",2020-07-04 20:59:00
965,Subhajoy Roy And Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus outbreak: 30 of NRS test negative for Covid-19 - Telegraph India,"Thirty of the 79 healthcare providers of NRS hospital quarantined over the weekend for being exposed to a coronavirus patient have tested negative for Covid-19, the state health department said on Tuesday.The swab test results of many others are still to arrive. Swab samples of several others will be collected and sent for tests in the next few days, according to hospital officials.The patient, a man in his 30s, died at the hospital on Saturday after being admitted with a blood disorder problem three to four days ago. Doctors had kept him in the male general ward since he did not show any symptom of the virus, a government official said. For the same reason, they did not take any extra precaution while treating him. He was shifted to the critical care unit when his condition worsened, the official said.By then he had started showing symptoms of Covid-19 and his swab sample was sent for tests. “He tested positive but the report came after his death. That is why all healthcare providers who had been exposed to him have been quarantined,” the official said.Some of those quarantined include doctors, members of the nursing staff and cleaners. Most have been kept at a hotel in New Town, while some have been home-quarantined. Of the 79 quarantined, 39 are doctors, a hospital official said.“The swab test results of 30 healthcare providers arrived late on Monday. They have all tested negative. Their swab samples had been sent for tests on Saturday,” a health department official said.Santanu Sen, the chairman of NRS Hospital’s Rogi Kalyan Samiti and state secretary of the Indian Medical Association, Bengal, said the “decision to quarantine them was taken by the principal and the hospital administration. They will get them back into service at the earliest after maintaining proper protocol”.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Monday urged people with symptoms of Covid-19 to visit only designated hospitals such as MR Bangur. “A patient with pneumonia went to NRS hospital. He died and after his death it became known that he had tested positive for Covid-19. Now, all doctors and nurses are worried. Doctors and nurses need to be in good health,” she had said.The hospital’s male medicine ward and the critical care unit where the patient had undergone treatment have been sealed. Civic workers sprayed disinfectants on the hospital premises on Tuesday.A doctor at the hospital said the quarantined people included interns as well junior doctors — postgraduate trainee and house-staff doctors. Many junior doctors and interns were still at the hospital’s hostel. “What will they do? They have to stay back to treat patients,” the doctor said.Adviser in quarantineThe adviser to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s health department is in home quarantine after it emerged that a patient who had visited him tested positive for Covid-19, officials of the civic body said.The officials said swab samples of the adviser would be collected. If the report is positive, a large number of employees in the CMC’s health department, including senior officials, will have to be sent to home quarantine.A number of medical officers and borough health officers will be among those who will have to quarantine themselves.“A person who tested positive for the coronavirus (which causes Covid-19) visited our adviser’s chamber in the CMC headquarters on Saturday morning. The adviser attended office and held important meetings on Saturday,” the official said. A CMC official said they were waiting anxiously for the results. “If he tests positive, many of us will have to be in home quarantine. A lot of health-related work will suffer,” the official said. Among the major tasks of the CMC health department is to keep tabs on all those who are in home quarantine and trace contacts of those who are testing positive for the virus.",2020-07-04 21:00:00
966,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus: Covid-19 hospitals in three orbits - Telegraph India," India’s health ministry on Tuesday announced plans for a three-tier network of Covid-19 patient management centres that will for the first time separate patients with mild and moderate symptoms from those with severe disease for rational use of hospital facilities.The network — Covid Care Centres (CCC) for suspects and patients with mild symptoms, Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) for moderate cases, and Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) for patients with severe disease — will become increasingly relevant as the count of patients rises.A medical task force set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee also on Tuesday unveiled its proposal to classify Covid-19 patients into three categories, or “orbits,” depending on their symptoms.The categorisation and separation that the task force has outlined is in line with the health ministry’s guidelines for the network and intended to provide appropriate and timely care, health officials said. Until now, all patients detected with Covid-19 symptoms — even mild symptoms — have been isolated in hospitals across the country. “This will help us in better, more efficient distribution of human resources and infrastructure,” a state government official said. The three-tier network will allow the government to assign specialists and other doctors as well as critical care equipment such as ventilators where they are most needed.The CCC — what the Bengal task force has designated as Orbit A — will be reserved for patients with mild symptoms such as upper respiratory symptoms, cough or fever. Global data suggest that around 80 per cent of Covid-19 cases have only mild symptoms and do not require hospital care.The health ministry said the CCCs may be set up in hostels, hotels, schools and stadiums. Currently functional hospitals managing non-Covid patients should be designated as CCCs only as a last resort.Doctors qualified in traditional systems of medicine may be stationed in CCCs under supervision of modern medical doctors, the health ministry said.The Bengal task force said non-specialists from fields other than pulmonology or anaesthesiology could be assigned to Orbit A.The DCHC, or Orbit B, will hold patients with moderate illness, including patients with pneumonia and respiratory distress but not severe disease. The DCHC will need oxygen support facilities and the patients will need intense monitoring.Health officials in Bengal said up to 20 per cent Covid-19 patients could develop moderate disease.The DCH, or Orbit C, is intended for patients with severe disease who will need critical care facilities, including ventilators.Ambulances will be available round-the-clock at all three categories of care centres.Community health specialist say the three-tier system would be needed when numbers become large. “When patients’ numbers run into thousands, we cannot keep people not critically ill in hospitals,” said Yogesh Jain, a physician and community health expert with Jan Swasthya Abhiyan in Bilaspur.“We would be forced to keep them in a community isolation facility which should be close to people’s homes but with good facilities... Such patients would need to be monitored and shifted to hospitals only if they become severe.”",2020-07-04 21:01:00
967,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown: Kitchens to feed stray animals in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A bunch of professionals, doctors, research students and businessmen have started two community kitchens to feed stray animals.The food cooked in the kitchens near Khanna cinema and in Behala is packed and picked up by team members, who distribute them in their areas, said Jignesh Thakkar, a businessman who is part of the group. The menu alternates between khichdi and chicken and rice.The volunteers connect through a WhatsApp group, which has as its members over 100 men and women from different walks of life.“We are distributing the food during lunch and dinner hours. Most food shops that would give leftovers to the animals are shut and they are going hungry. We ensure that each one of our members wears gloves and masks and maintains social distancing while they are out on distribution runs,” Thakkar said.Akash Gupta, who runs the kitchen in Behala that caters to Behala and parts of Joka, said: “We noticed that all the eateries in the area are closed and the animals are fighting among themselves for food.”The group had started with individual contributions from members and is now exploring crowd-funding options.Food packets are also being distributed among pavement dwellers, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, cooks and domestic help.",2020-07-04 21:02:00

970,Our Special Correspondent,Birth centenary celebrations of Swami Atmasthananda postponed - Telegraph India,"The organisers of the birth centenary celebrations of Swami Atmasthananda, the 15th president of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission who passed away on June 18, 2017, have decided to postpone the programme because of the lockdown. The programme was to be held at Biswa Bangla Convention Centre in New Town on May 10. Sunil Kanti Roy, the president of the Swami Atmasthananda Birth Centenary Committee, said the revised schedule would be announced once the situation improved.Swami Smaranananda, the present president of the order, and Swami Suvirananda, the general secretary, were to attend the programme. A set of commemorative volumes and a pictorial biography of Swami Atmasthananda would have been released on the occasion. The commemorative volumes include reminiscences about the monk by many, including Asim Dasgupta, a former finance minister of Bengal.Swami Atmasthananda, who left behind around 67,000 direct disciples, was born on May 21, 1919, in Sabajpur, near Dhaka. He joined the Math and Mission in 1941 at the age of 22. In 1945, Swami Virajananda initiated him into brahmacharya vows and gave the name Shantichaitanya. In 1949, he was initiated into sannyasa and named Swami Atmasthananda. Swami Atmasthananda became general secretary of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in 1992 and was in that post for five years till 1997, when he became vice-president of the order. On December 3, 2007, he became president of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission.",2020-07-05 00:07:00
971,,Coronavirus lockdown: Mall owners plead to Centre for consent to reopen - Telegraph India,"Mall owners are pleading with the Centre and state governments to let them reopen the establishments as the cost of prolonged closure weighs heavy on retailers, developers and tens of thousands of people employed in the sector.Developers have written to the Prime Minister's Office, Union home ministry and chief ministers seeking permission to open malls for at least limited time. The managements are ready to follow all hygiene protocols and run truncated operations.“While we recognise the need for a gradual opening of economic activities, it is equally important to emphasise that malls are better equipped to provide a safe and hygienic environment compared to establishments that are allowed to open,” Harshvardhan Neotia, the chairman of Ambuja Neotia Group, said.The Centre has allowed all standalone shops to open, essential and non-essential, except those in containment zones. The Shopping Centre Association of India (SCAI), an umbrella association of malls in India and Credai, a realtors' body, have written to the Centre and the state government seeking permission to open malls. They are yet to get any positive response.Calcutta situationThere are about 10 malls in and around Calcutta, employing close to 50,000 people.“If we have to restart consumption, which will give a fillip to the manufacturing activities at the back end, the malls should be allowed to open. There is a feeling that malls are just for hanging out. It is not. This is serious business, earning big bucks for the government, too,” said Rahul Saraf, a founding member of SCAI and owner of Calcutta’s first mall, Forum Courtyard. Most of the developers seem ready to reopen malls but not multiplexes and restaurants, which are big crowd-pullers. It would be easier for the government to monitor malls because officials have to deal with a handful of people (mall owners), compared with the owners of standalone shops, developers said.“Let there be a start. If it is found unviable, the permission can be withdrawn,” Saraf said.Economic costThe spectre of salary and job cuts is looming large on industry as malls and retail shops continue to remain shut. Many of the 50,000 people working in the 10-odd malls in and around the city have been furloughed (told to go on unpaid leave). Retailers have written to developers asking for waiver of rentals during the lockdown. Developers are reluctant to agree because of their financial commitments to lenders and others.“We are just keeping those letters in the file. It is too early to act on them. Let the malls open first,” Sushil Mohta, the owner of Acropolis mall and co-owner of South City, said.",2020-07-05 00:07:00
972,TT Bureau,Lab owner arrested for virus test without ICMR nod - Telegraph India,"The owner of a private laboratory in north Calcutta's Kankurgachhi, which was allegedly conducting Covid-19 tests without necessary approvals, was arrested on Wednesday, a senior police officer said. Ratan Lal Gupta, the proprietor of Tribeni Clinic, at P-323 CIT Road, was booked for cheating, dishonestly inducing delivery of property and criminal conspiracy. He has also been booked under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Act, 2017, the officer said.The state health department had on Tuesday fined the laboratory Rs 10 lakh on the ground that it was conducting Covid-19 tests without approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). No diagnostic laboratory in India can conduct the test for detecting coronavirus infection without ICMR’s approval.“We have arrested the owner of Tribeni Clinic,” said Ajoy Prasad, the deputy commissioner of the eastern suburban division of Calcutta police. Dr Lal’s Pathlabs, Tata Medical Center and Suraksha Diagnostic in New Town, AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and Peerless Hospital are the five private facilities in Calcutta that have ICMR’s approval to conduct Covid-19 tests. The government facilities in the city with ICMR’s approval for the test are SSKM Hospital, NICED, School of Tropical Medicine, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Command Hospital and the New Town campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI). The protocol for testing issued by ICMR says an individual cannot just walk into a laboratory to get tested. One needs a doctor’s prescription to undergo the test. The police said a case had been started against Gupta based on a letter of complaint from Hare Krishna Chanda, the deputy director of health Services (admin) of the state government.“According to the complaint, the clinic was issuing fake reports of Covid-19 tests pretending to be registered for the test. We have started investigating the allegations,” said an officer of Phoolbagan police station. It was not clear till late on Wednesday whether the people who got themselves tested at Tribeni Clinic had produced any doctor’s prescription. “We are trying to find out the details,” an officer said.",2020-07-05 00:08:00
973,Sanjay Mandal,"Kolkata boy on New York frontline, 2 days after recovery from coronavirus - Telegraph India","A Calcutta boy who is now a doctor at a hospital in New York, the current global epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, was himself infected with the coronavirus about two weeks back but resumed duty two days after he recovered.Abhishek Chakraborti, 28, a postgraduate trainee in internal medicine at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York City, said he did nothing extraordinary by returning to work so soon after recovery.Most of his colleagues and senior doctors who were infected with the new coronavirus returned to work within days of being cured of the infection, he said. One of the seniors Chakraborti was referring to had been in the critical care unit for several days.“We have never seen anything like this ever. This is not the time to complain but to work and save as many lives as possible,” Chakraborti, who grew up in Calcutta's Golpark area, told Metro from the Brooklyn hospital by phone on Wednesday. He is thankful to the New York City community. “Restaurants which have shut down their businesses are opening their kitchens for us and supplying food because our hospital cafeteria is closed,” he said.“Engineers and local welding units are manufacturing face shields and donating them to us. The community is donating ski goggles and hazmat suits because there is an acute shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE, in the US,” said Chakraborti, a former student of St James School who did his MBBS from Kasturba Medical College in Manipal in 2017. In Calcutta and other parts of India, there have been instances of doctors and nurses involved in treating Covid-19 patients facing hostility from their landlords and neighbours. Many were asked to leave their rented accommodations, forcing police to intervene.   “In New York City, the community stood by us, donating food, N95 masks and 3D printing face shields. Every day at 7pm, the city gathers on its balconies to celebrate healthcare workers with music and applause,” Chakraborti said. Are doctors and other healthcare workers complaining about the shortage of protective gear, which is one reason for so many of them getting infected?It’s always a concern, said Abhishek. “There are discussions with the hospital authorities about whom to approach for PPE and how to procure them. But there are no angry demands or threats from senior or junior doctors,” he said.At Brookdale Hospital, Abhishek said, doctors from all fields are treating Covid-19 patients. Gastroenterologists, cardiologists and general surgeons have been trained in coronavirus treatment protocol and are standing in for their infected colleagues who have to isolate themselves.When did Chakraborti get infected? “Two weeks ago I had fever and cough and tested positive for the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Thankfully, I made a speedy recovery but the time I spent at home allowed me to process some of what I had seen, experienced and been a part of,” he said.Some of his colleagues, including a senior doctor, are in the critical care unit.No one there had imagined that the Covid-19 crisis would be what it is now.“In February, we were excited about a new virus. But reality started hitting us from March 18, when patients started getting admitted,” he said.The 300-bed hospital now has 100-odd Covid-19 positive patients. The remaining 200 are awaiting test results. “BHMC (Brookdale Hospital Medical Center) got its first Covid-19 patient on March 18. The initial excitement of treating a novel disease was quickly replaced by fear, fatigue and a sense of hopelessness as New York became the new epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the subsequent weeks,” said Chakraborti.“By the second week of the pandemic in New York, the face shields and N95 masks began to run short, plastic gowns were precious commodities and ventilators had to be wheeled in from nearby nursing homes to the frontlines. When you hear a ‘CODE 99’ blaring over the announcement system, you drop everything you’re doing and run. It’s the signal that someone in the hospital has suffered a cardiac arrest. On an average week, this happens two to three times. Now, there are days when this death knell sounds 9 to 10 times,” he said.The ICUs were full to the brim within the first two weeks and as cases continued to rise exponentially, the medical floors had to be converted to mini-ICUs. The morgue was filled to capacity and three refrigerated trucks were lined up behind the hospital to deal with the overflow of bodies.“Oxygen supplies depleted. We were running short of infusion pumps to keep sedation drips running for our intubated patients and the spectre of sickness and death was hanging over each and every one of us…. We fought a poorly understood enemy with weapons that were shooting blank. As the weeks passed, I saw my colleagues, our consultants, nurses, patient-care technicians and transporters getting sick. Some were admitted to hospital but most recovered at home and came back to the frontlines as soon as they could crawl out of bed. Some remained critical, some succumbed,” said the Calcutta boy.To his colleagues, teachers, friends and family back home, who have started to deal with what he has gone through, Chakraborti wants to say: “The battle you will fight will be long and hard and the enemy is still poorly understood. Protect yourself the best you can, advocate for your patients and keep your families safe. You will get through this as we did, you may get sick, you will see people you know getting sick. Some will die but the tools you have as a physician are the only weapons that can be used to fight this war, where guns mean nothing. I hope the community stands by you and appreciates the sacrifices being made. I hope people stay home, wash their hands and wear masks in public. I hope the fight is short and the victory sweet. Know that all of us who call India home, no matter where they chose to live, work or train, are rooting for you and ready to help in any way they can.”",2020-07-05 00:14:00
975,Subhajoy Roy,Calcutta Municipal Corporation sample drive for Covid-19 in localities - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has started collecting samples of persons showing symptoms of Covid-19 from some of the worst affected places in the city, deputy mayor Atin Ghosh said on Wednesday. Ghosh said 200 samples were collected on Wednesday and the process would continue. The civic body, he said, does not want to wait for these people to go to hospital and get tested.“On Wednesday, samples were collected from six of the worst-hit wards — 24, 27, 57, 65, 60 and 62,” said Ghosh, who also heads the health department of the civic body. A senior CMC doctor said three medical technologists collected samples in the six wards. The places from where the samples were collected included Tiljala Shibtala Lane, Canal South Road, Ladies Park off CIT Road, Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Maniktala Bazar Lane and Nimtala Ghat Street. A source said a similar drive would be done in Muchibazar, near Ultadanga, on Thursday.Till Tuesday, anyone who had symptoms of Covid-19 had to go to any of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved laboratories in the city to get tested. A prescription was needed for the test. A CMC doctor said sample collection at the community level was a welcome step. Ever since the door-to-door surveillance was started in the slums about a month ago, the CMC surveillance team is coming across many people with symptoms of Covid-19. But many of them were reluctant to visit any hospital to get tested, a doctor said. It was also not possible for the CMC to take so many people to testing centres. “Collection of samples in the neighbourhood makes the process easier…. Surveillance will be meaningless if we cannot test suspected cases and know how much the infection has spread,” said a CMC doctor.According to public health professionals, an effective measure against Covid-19 is to test and isolate positive persons to stop the spread of the infection. More than 750 cases have been reported in the city till Wednesday and the numbers are increasing steadily. “The majority of the new cases are from slums in north and central Calcutta. So, going into the community for tests was necessary,” said a CMC official. Officials said there had been talks about installing kiosks in some ward health clinics, modelled on the ones used in South Korea.",2020-07-05 00:18:00
976,Jhinuk Mazumdar,"Coronavirus lockdown: Parents in ‘classroom’, teachers on ‘stage’ - Telegraph India","Classrooms have moved into drawing rooms, giving parents a chance to question what is being taught in class and how  —something they could not have done earlier.The head of one school told her teachers they were on “stage” and there was no scope for mistakes. With parents gaining access to the “classroom”, teachers have to put their best foot forward.“I have told my teachers that they are performing on stage and everyone is watching them and they cannot afford to make mistakes,” said Reeta Chatterjee, principal of the Apeejay Schools. Parents have always had limited access to schools.“There was a wall between the parents and the teachers that the parent had to respect,” said a school head. Parents were allowed only till the school gate and not beyond. A principal of a girls' school said parents were “often not treated as part of the school”. “From the gatekeeper to the principal’s secretary, every one  would make them feel unwelcome and ask them why they were there,” she said.Parents are happy to get their “rightful place” and to be able to question or show disapproval instead of being treated as “outsiders”.One parent said “online classes” allowed them an insight into the classroom.“Parents always had the right to ask but it was the high-handedness of some schools that didn’t allow them to do so and hence they have to keep quiet,” said the principal of a school in south Calcutta. The heads of some schools said teachers were trying to cope with the “paradigm shift”. “The lesson plan that teachers are making has to be comprehensive and creative because it is a challenge to hold the attention of the student in the drawing room. Besides the student, the parent is also trying to understand the class and help the child in the learning process,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, the principal of La Martiniere for Girls. Some parents have also shared their feedback with schools.One teacher said parents have also overstepped when they have recorded the classes and sent the transcript back to the school.“Parents have a right to question but they should not do so in the presence of their children, else the child will not show respect to the teacher,” said Chatterjee.Former La Martiniere for Boys’ principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi said parents must be “patient and sympathetic”.“All 50 parents cannot and should not share their perspective during a class. Parents have been empowered but there has to be a proper forum where they can put across their ideas,” he said. Teachers are also grappling with a new mode of teaching and schools feel parents must appreciate that. “The rules of the game cannot change midway and if a teacher is unable to deliver in an audio-visual medium, it does not mean she is not a good teacher. The parameters of judging her cannot change overnight,' said Sharmila Bose, principal of Sushila Birla Girls’ School.",2020-07-05 00:23:00
978,TT Bureau,Choked pits in Kolkata make warning come true as rain causes waterlogging - Telegraph India,"A 30-minute downpour flooded Calcutta on Sunday afternoon.The waterlogged roads brought back memories of May 20 when Cyclone Amphan had wreaked havoc in the city.Stretches of Esplanade, Park Street, Camac Street, AJC Bose Road, Ballygunge Circular Road, Ballygunge Place and portions of Jodhpur Park and Dhakuria were under ankle-deep or knee-deep water by evening.A government official who lives on Ironside Road said he could see knee-deep water on the road in front from his balcony around 5pm, an hour after the rain started. Ballygunge Circular Road and other adjacent roads were flooded.The Telegraph has reported more than once about the fear of catch pits getting choked by dead foliage and other debris left in the aftermath of the cyclone. The blocked pits led to the flooding on Sunday, a civic official said.The Met office termed Sunday’s rain, triggered by tall thunderclouds that came from the northwest of the city, “pre-monsoon showers”.The sky turned pitch dark by 4pm and the showers started soon after. Heavy rain lasted for around 30 minutes but a drizzle persisted for the next hour.The Met office recorded 69mm of rain in Alipore.The water pumping stations of the civic body recorded 96mm of rain in New Market, 84mm in Jodhpur Park, 77mm in Dhakuria and 80mm in Ballygunge.The rain was relatively less in north and east Calcutta: 48mm in Dhapa, 28mm in Cossipore and 12mm in Dum Dum.Engineers familiar with Calcutta’s drainage network design said twigs of chopped trees might have slipped through the gaps in the rainwater catch pits by the roadside and blocked the channel under ground.There is a sump under every rainwater catch pit that has a channel connecting it with the main drainage line under the road. “The way the roads were cleared and the debris remained by the roadside, there is every possibility of twigs blocking the mouth of the channel from the sump. This can lead to more flooding during the monsoon if not cleared immediately,” one such engineer said.A CMC engineer said sumps could get clogged by leaves and twigs. But the civic body is cleaning the sumps, ahead of the monsoon, the engineer said.The variation in the amount of rainfall was attributed to the location of the thunderclouds. “Large and strong shells had formed over parts of central and south Calcutta. Those areas received much more rain than places under small shells,” G.K. Das, director, India Meteorological Centre, Calcutta, said.Tarak Singh, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators who is in charge of drainage, said the rain had been “massive” in many places. “That’s why some roads have been flooded. We are running all pumps and the water will be drained out by tonight,” he said on Sunday evening.The AJC Bose Road flyover got flooded during the rain. A government engineer said flooding was possible if pipes that drain out rainwater were choked. They have to be cleaned periodically, a CMC engineer said.The maximum temperature in Calcutta had been over the normal mark for the past few days. The humidity, too, was on the climb, leading to uncomfortable sweaty conditions. Around 2pm on Sunday, the temperature was 36 degrees Celsius.A cyclonic circulation over Eastern Uttar Pradesh and the pent up heat on the land led to the formation of the thunderclouds, said a Met official.“The monsoon is round the corner, signalling the change in the direction of winds from northwesterly to southeasterly. The northwesterly winds are very weak now. That led to the large shells staying over Calcutta for a longer duration than usual. Otherwise, the winds would have pushed the cloud towards the Bay,” a Met official said.The monsoon is expected to reach Calcutta by June 11 and 12, the Met office said on Sunday.",2020-07-06 20:41:00
979,TT Bureau,Coronavirus pandemic: Woman and mother die in quick succession in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A 56-year-old woman and her mother who had appeared frail to a doctor when he last visited them on Thursday died within hours of each other in Salt Lake’s BE Block on Saturday night.Sharmistha Kar Purkayastha, 56, former wife of state security adviser Surajit Kar Purkayastha, and her mother Papia De, 77, were found in critical condition at their BE-71 home by some of their relatives on Saturday evening, police said.A doctor on call examined them and announced they had died. They were declared dead at Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital.Some relatives of the deceased women had earlier tried to get them admitted to a hospital because they had “Covid-19 like symptoms”, the police said. They apparently preferred staying at home.The relatives had reached their home on Saturday evening to persuade them to go to hospital.“On Saturday evening, when some relatives went to visit them, they found Papia De lying motionless…. Sharmistha Kar Purkayastha’s condition was very serious. A doctor reached their home around 9pm and said both had passed away,” Surya Pratap Yadav, deputy commissioner of the Bidhannagar commissionerate, said. “The relatives took both of them to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional hospital where both were declared brought dead.”Preliminary investigations suggested the relatives had tried to get them admitted to hospital on Friday but failed because the women were unwilling to leave home, Yadav said.The bodies underwent post-mortem on Sunday. Preliminary reports have ruled out foul play, the police said.Sharmistha, an MSc in biology with a postdoctoral degree in antibiotics, had worked as the principal of Gyan Bharati Balika Vidyalaya. She had joined the BJP in 2014.“Sharmistha Purkaystha (wife of Surajit Kar Purkaystha) was found dead in her apartment. She was a member of our party and we demand an independent inquiry into her death,” state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.Papia, who had suffered a fractured femur, had returned home from hospital 15 days ago. Some neighbours suspected they had Covid-19 and alerted the civic body.Acting on an alert from the local councillor, chief medical officer of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Kusum Adhikary went to check on the women on Thursday. “Sharmistha could barely move while her mother was completely bedridden and did not respond when I called out to her,” Adhikary told Metro on Sunday. “Her temperature was normal. But she complained of feeling feverish, weak and drowsy.”Adhikary said he had told the mayoral council member in charge of health, Pranay Kumar Ray, to get them admitted to hospital.Ray said they had not shifted the women to a government-run hospital because of their “background” and the fact that they would be held responsible in case anything went wrong. “They are high profile. All the blame would have come on us if anything went wrong.”Basab Aich, a resident of BE Block, said the women rarely interacted with neighbours. “The news of their deaths has sparked fear of infection among neighbours.”On Sunday, a team of civic officials sanitised the house and the road in front of it.",2020-07-06 20:47:00
980,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus pandemic: Fear, transport woes keep hospitals empty - Telegraph India","Fear of getting infected by the novel coronavirus and lack of public transport is still keeping away the majority of patients from the hospitals and clinics, doctors and officials have said.Patients are either cancelling or deferring planned surgeries and appointments. Many patients whom doctors have advised tests prefer to get them done at standalone centres instead of going to a hospital, according to doctors.Several private hospitals were reluctant to treat Covid-19 positive patients in the initial days of the outbreak. They were worried that other patients would avoid their hospitals for fear of getting infected.Later, the state government, through the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, urged private hospitals to have dedicated units for Covid-19 patients and later pressed them to increase the number of beds.Many Calcuttans are trying to find out which healthcare unit in the city is a “non-Covid” hospital or does not have a dedicated unit to treat such patients before getting their relatives admitted there.A man was supposed to undergo cardiac surgery this Tuesday. When an employee of the hospital where the surgery had been scheduled called him last week for confirmation, he said his relatives had advised him against getting admitted to the hospital because it had many Covid patients.“Several cancer patients whom I recently advised PET-CT Scan or MRI told me they would get the tests done from standalone centres instead of going to a hospital,” surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay said. “The patients and their relatives said they were sacred of getting infected with the Covid-19 virus in a hospital,” Mukhopadhyay said.A private hospital’s CEO said there was fear among some doctors, hospital employees and patients. The fear has prevented the healthcare system to return to normality.Many people have the misconception of a non-Covid hospital, according to doctors and officials of various hospitals.“Recently, a snakebite patient came to us with no Covid symptoms. We did a test for Covid-19 as part of a mandatory process and the results were positive,” Gandharv Roy, COO of Medica Superspecialty Hospital, said. “This misconception has prevented many people from undergoing treatment; often for critical diseases, too. The number of overall admissions and regular surgeries has dropped,” Roy said.Footfall figures at OPDs in most private hospitals have hardly been more than 25 per cent a week after lockdown restrictions were eased.Neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh and Bhutan, apart from districts and other states, account for the chunk of patients at these hospitals.The number has been close to 150 for Belle Vue Clinic and the hospital’s ophthalmology unit. Usually, the hospital has close to 500 patients every day on average, according to officials.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences in Mukundapur has close to 1,000 patients at its OPDs every day. The number had dipped to 10 with the announcement of the lockdown. Now, it is close to 250.“Restrictions have been eased significantly but the number of patients is nowhere close to our usual numbers,” R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, said.The Mukundapur hospital is the group’s flagship unit.“Based on our experience, patients are either not able to come because of limited or no availability of transport, including trains, or for fear of contracting Covid-19 at the hospital,” he said.  During video consultations with doctors, patients have expressed their inability to visit the hospital for surgeries.Some hospital and clinics have cited lack of transport as another problem.A private clinic in south Calcutta has had every one of five patients cancelling their appointments, saying they cannot reach on time.Now, hospitals and clinics are giving appointments at a specific time to ensure distancing rules are followed.",2020-07-06 20:50:00
982,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Grocers’ moment and test - Telegraph India,"The lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus has propelled neighbourhood grocers, who had been sidelined for long by retail stores in malls, to centre stage.They have been the lifeline sustaining households as malls stayed shut and delivery of online orders remained erratic. Malls are set to open from June 8 but many such grocers are banking on people’s apprehension about visiting public places to ensure a robust future.Biswajit Saha, the owner of Laxmi Narayan Stores on Hindusthan Road, has lost a few kilos and many hours of sleep in the past two months. “From 8am to 3.30pm, I did not get time to sit for even 10 minutes. There was a constant rush of customers,” Saha, better known as Bapi in the area, said. “Earlier, a nap in the noon was common.”It took The Telegraph several phone calls and three visits to have a detailed conversation with Saha.“A large section used to buy only soft drinks, soda and cigarettes, and an occasional bar of chocolate. They used to buy cereals and pulses from malls because I could not match the bulk discounts they got there. But they have been buying everything from me since March 22,” he said.Saha, a Garia resident, said he spent hours waiting for a government bus to Gariahat and back every day. “I doze off in the bus during the return journey daily because of the exhaustion.”Tapan Paria, another grocer in Muchipara near Tollygunge, used to sell stuff worth Rs 5,000 on a good day before the lockdown. His average daily sales volume in April and May was close to Rs 10,000.A noticeable difference in the profile of his customers — residents of nearby housing complexes who would seldom visit his store earlier. During the first two weeks of the lockdown, Paria had noticed “panic buying”. “People would stock up on everything. Brands did not matter… they would take anything available.”Crippled supply chainThe grocers continued selling stuff to people but faced several challenges in getting the stuff from wholesalers and “company godowns”.Earlier, representatives of FMCG companies and local producers would regularly visit the stores to supply everything. Grocers would procure cereals, pulses and masalas from wholesalers. Most other items were delivered to the stores by companies.The entire supply chain of these companies has been crippled during the lockdown, making grocers dependent on wholesalers for everything from rice to toothpaste. For many, that means buying stuff at a higher price and a reduction in profit margins. Some passed the buck to retail customers.People in the distribution channels of leading FMCG companies said the absence of suburban trains was behind the crippled supply chain. More than 90 per cent of workers in the chain — from unloading goods at godowns to delivering them at stores — are from the outskirts of Calcutta and are dependent on suburban trains. The Sealdah south section accounts for a bulk of them, according to company officials.A few companies brought some workers to Calcutta in their transport. “These men have been living in godowns and offices in the city and barely sustaining the supply chain,” a supervisor of a leading brand’s distribution channel across south Calcutta said.Hiring a car to visit company godowns is not financially feasible for many grocers. Wholesalers have been receiving products from companies. “It is more viable to send stuff to a wholesaler who can cater to many retail grocers,” the supervisor said.Future tenseMalls are set to reopen from June 8 but neighbourhood grocers are upbeat that people would not desert them soon. “Almost all my customers have said they will not risk going to a crowded mall. I hope at least 50 per cent of them stick to their word,” Paria, the grocer at Muchipara, said.The supply chain, which has slightly improved over the past few weeks, is unlikely to be back to normal any time soon. Railway officials said.Suburban trains are suspended till June 30, according to rail officials. It is unlikely that suburban trains will get a nod to run from July 1.“Passengers travelling on long-distance trains can be tracked. We can list their details. But if suburban trains start running, it will be impossible to keep details of all passengers,” a rail official said. “The average daily passenger volume at Sealdah station is close to 1.2 million. Suburban trains comprise the bulk of the number.”",2020-07-06 20:51:00
984,Kinsuk Basu,Bengal govt urges operators to run more buses - Telegraph India,"The state government on Sunday urged private bus and minibus operators to ensure more buses from Monday when more people will be out on the roads as offices, malls and restaurants open.Some private operators, however, insisted on an immediate fare revision before rolling out more buses and minibuses.At a meeting with private operators on Sunday, transport department officials asked bus owners to let them know in writing why they wanted a fare hike while explaining income and expenditure. But before that bus owners should ensure more buses on the roads from Monday, officials told the operators at the meeting.Several operators said they would try and run additional buses but the demand-supply gap would still remain.Close to 9,000 private buses operate in Calcutta and neighbouring areas. Since June 1, 700-odd buses have been on the roads, leaving people waiting at bus stops. Transport officials said they would run around 1,100 buses from Monday, scaling up the fleet strength by almost 400 more buses.“We will try and bring out more buses… most buses require mechanical overhauling and owners don’t have money to do that,” Rahul Chatterjee of Bus Minibus Samonnoy Samity said. “We have told the government that all buses won’t be out on the roads in the absence of a fare hike.”“Several workers are still reluctant to resume duty. Owners haven’t seen enough returns to feel enthused to run more buses,” Pradip Narayan Bose of West Bengal Bus Minibus Owners Association said.All government and private offices will open from June 8, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said on May 29.",2020-07-06 20:54:00
985,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus pandemic: CNI service from next month - Telegraph India,"Service in all churches under the Calcutta and Barrackpore dioceses of Church of North India (CNI) will start in the first week of July, Reverend Paritosh Canning, bishop of Calcutta, said on Sunday.The Calcutta diocese of the CNI has 34 churches under it and the Barrackpore diocese has 107. Bishop Canning has the additional responsibility of managing the Barrackpore diocese in the absence of a full-time bishop.According to Canning, all the churches will have to be sanitised and arrangements made to repeat the sanitisation after every service.Seating arrangements will have to be reorganised for maintaining social distance and several other preventive measures will have to taken for starting the service.“We are not in the state of preparedness for resuming the service now. It will take a few more weeks to complete the preparations,” the bishop said.The archdiocese of Calcutta that has 65 odd Roman Catholic churches under it has granted permission to the churches to conduct the service. But they have been asked to keep at 10 the maximum number of devotees inside at a time.Archbishop Thomas D’Souza said the Roman Catholic churches are hoping to resume the service with full capacity after a few weeks.“The 65 churches have now been given the permission to resume the services. But they have been asked to conduct the services following the restriction… Ten people can be allowed at a time…. But I have still not got the details on services were held in how many churches today (Sunday),” Archbishop Thomas D’Souza said.Bishop Canning said that although there would be no service now, devotees would be allowed to pray inside the churches, 10 at a time as asked by the state government.The same restrictions apply to the Roman catholic churches as well, archbishop Thomas D’Souza said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had recently announced that places of worship could reopen from June 1.",2020-07-06 20:56:00
987,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus pandemic: Online classes bane for kids with disabilities - Telegraph India,"Children with disabilities need extra hand-holding when they attend online classes with others who are not like them. But they don’t get that, parents in the city have said.Many mainstream schools in Calcutta have a certain number of children with disabilities in their classrooms. These children are used to an inclusive environment but online classes have taken them out of that set-up and they are all alone in front of a device.Teachers follow a certain pace and many are unable to follow or comprehend what is being taught and it becomes a “one way communication,” many parents have said.“In a physical classroom they can interact with teachers in a better way but online teaching often becomes a one-way communication where they cannot respond because they are not used to this form of learning. There is a risk of feeling left out,” Anamika Sinha, the director of Manovikas Kendra, said.Teachers said they, too, were unable to connect with students.“Often, when a teacher asks a certain question my son cannot understand that it is directed at him. If he cannot answer he gets irritated and is not in the class though he is there physically,” Mamata Sarkar whose 14-year-old son has autism said.A parent who is a doctor said children were familiar with computers or a smartphone but some “find it difficult to process the information”.“In some children, the auditory processing is delayed and they lip read what the teacher is saying. But some teachers keep videos switched off because of Network connectivity problems and children find it difficult to follow instructions,” Aditi Bandyopadhyay, whose son is in Class VI and has special needs, said.Some schools have been holding separate classes for children with disabilities and some have been providing them with remedial classes, but it is not always enough.“I think the medium of instruction, which is the screen, is the biggest challenge because children with special needs need a human touch and presence which they don’t get,” Sharmila Bose, principal of Sushila Birla Girls School, said.Terence Ireland, principal of St James’ School, said screens could be a hindrance. “The teacher is not looking at individual students and it is 30 minutes of lecture or explanation and it is not clear to them who are able to grasp.”Children who have just stepped into mainstream school are unable to relate to the teacher. “My son is three years old… all his teachers are new and I can understand he can’t connect with them because he hasn’t seen them before. In fact, it is not possible for the teacher to give individual attention to each child online. The system doesn’t allow it,” a woman said.Teachers have been thrust into this new mode of teaching, which happened suddenly for most schools and they got no time for preparation.“Nobody got the time to prepare and schools are thinking about getting the curriculum going. Teachers in an online classroom are unable to scan the classroom or make eye contact or read the facial expressions, which are clues for teachers to assess the class,” Indrani Basu, founder, Autism Society West Bengal, said.",2020-07-06 21:27:00
989,Snehal Sengupta,Covid-19 patient takes shelter in CK Market stall - Telegraph India,"A shopkeeper who tested positive spent four to five days living in her shop inside CK Market after her family asked her not to return home. When other shopkeepers found out they hounded her out.The lady, in her late 50s, sells puja material and sundry items at her stall. On Friday, the sub-divisional hospital in DD Block handed her a report confirming that she had Covid-19. Since her case was not severe, doctors advised her home isolation. But her family members refused to take her in.“I stay in Barasat with my daughter, her husband and my grandson. But when I got fever a week back, they asked me not to return home fearing Covid. They were even more adamant when I went for my test and the reports came positive. Since our house doesn’t have separate rooms they claimed isolation would not be possible,” she said.With nowhere to go, she spent about five days and nights at her stall. “I have a second daughter who stays in a single room in the tenements near City Centre, a third daughter who stays with her family at a garage near Udayachal Tourist Lodge in DG Block and a fourth daughter who stays in Nayapatty with her family. Everyone refused to have me.”By Sunday, other shopkeepers got suspicious and confronted her about why she was wasn’t going home. “She had been moving about freely despite her condition,” said one of the shopkeeper who uncovered the case. “She could be a super spreader. When we found out we drove her out of the market.”With nowhere to go, the woman spent at least six hours on different pavements in Salt Lake. The Telegraph Salt Lake found her on the pavement opposite the Tank 9 petrol pump.Clad in a printed sari, carrying a black umbrella and a packet with her medical report, the lady was sitting on the pavement with a number of passers-by and commuters waiting close by to board autos and buses.A call was made to Bidhannagar City Police commissioner Mukesh, after which a police team alerted the health department and got an ambulance to escort the woman to a safe house.“It was unfortunate that the woman had nowhere to go. Our team stayed with her while maintaining proper social distancing protocol,” said the police commissioner.Mayor Krishna Chakraborty said the woman had committed a grave mistake by living inside the market. “She could have called the Covid-19 helpline number or any of the councillors. If she needed help she could have asked us,” said Chakraborty.The woman, on her part, said she did not have any of these phone numbers. “No one from the corporation or health department got in touch with me to ask if I needed help,” she said.The lady is now in isolation at a Sector V safe house. “She only has mild fever,” said Maya Sarkar, the daughter who lives near City Centre. “It’s best that she stays there as none of us have homes big enough to keep here in isolation.”The state government has set up several safe houses across the city for people who have tested positive but are asymptomatic or showing mild symptoms.

990,Sudeshna Banerjee,NKDA opens safe house for New Town residents - Telegraph India,"A safe house exclusively for the residents of New Town is ready to start operation. It will house Covid-positive patients who do not have severe symptoms. The facility, operated by New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA), is located in a two-storeyed house next to Tank 12.“With hospitals unable to accommodate all Covid-19 positive patients, many with little or no symptoms are being asked to stay in home isolation. For that, one has to give an undertaking that one can self-isolate in a room and avail the services of a caregiver. But those who share a single room with other family members cannot opt for home isolation. This facility is for such people,” said Debashis Sen, chairman of NKDA.The building that has been identified for the facility in Action Area II is owned by Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) for use of the public health engineering department as a water supply point.The unoccupied building has a 4,000 sq ft. first floor which will house 20 beds. “Of them, 15 will be for men and five for women. The two wards have been partitioned off. We have placed cots. The health department has provided medical equipment like oxygen cylinders and masks, nebulisers, personal protective equipment and pulse oxymeters. It has been fitted out with telephone and closed circuit television. Other rooms like chambers for doctors and nurses and a dispensary are coming up,” Sen said.The facility will have two nurses in attendance. Two doctors will do the rounds twice a day. “It is basically a resting place with food provided for by the government.”In case an inmate turns serious, the NKDA has tied up with neighbouring Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) and Charnock Hospital to get them picked up in their ambulance and admit for treatment.So far, NKDA could send patients to the safe house being operated by the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation at Royal Banquets in Sector V for about two months now. The safe house, currently housing 13 inmates, can keep around 30 patients and is also tagged with CNCI for support. Only two people have needed hospitalisation so far, a civic official said.There are three safe houses in New Town — Haj House, NBCC Square and CFL Building. “But these are more a resource for all of Calcutta and the neighbouring districts,” Sen clarified.NKDA also plans to start Rapid Antigen Test at its health dispensary in Action Area III. “We are on the lookout for trained technicians which the health department is unable to provide us,” Sen added.The tests will start with the shopkeepers at NKDA markets who can be super spreaders as well as the Hidco and NKDA drivers. “Their lists have been drawn up. We have already started sending them to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital in Salt Lake in small batches. The hospital is testing seven patients referred by us daily. We can ramp up testing once we have our own testing facility,” he said.Another reason to start a facility in New Town is the reluctance of shopkeepers to travel all the way to Salt Lake for the test. “When our doctors are calling them up when their turn is coming they are refusing to travel such a distance, leaving their business unattended. If it is in New Town, it will be easier to convince them.”The Rapid Antigen Test gives out results almost instantaneously, unlike the RT-PCR test which takes almost 48 hours to yield results.NKDA had recently organised two health screening camps for labourers staying in New Town. Ten people were shortlisted for symptoms like loss of sense of taste and smell, high temperature and cough, and recommended for Covid-19 test by the attending doctors. “But they left their quarters once they learnt of the need to get themselves tested,” Sen said.",2020-07-08 00:09:00

I would build a Mosque, a Church, a Gurdwara, a Monastery and a Temple where it mattered most… where it would be safe from bombs, from ridicule, from harm, from all that is evil.
I would build it in the 
only place that matters… the silence, safety and sanctity of my heart.

992,Subhajoy Roy,Covid antigen test to focus on hawkers and traders  - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s drive to conduct antigen tests for Covid-19 will focus more on hawkers and traders, who get exposed to many people every day, than members of other professions once it opens testing centres, an official said.The civic body has planned to set up permanent testing centres in each of the 16 boroughs. An official said there would be at least three centres in each borough for conducting the antigen test. The first such centre was inaugurated inside the Roxy cinema building earlier this week. An official said hawkers of the Grand Arcade and other traders of the area would be asked to undergo tests at the centre.The outgoing councillor of Ward 46, which covers the central Calcutta shopping hubs, is talking to the various traders associations and hawker unions, urging the members to get themselves tested at the centre. Another centre will open in Ballygunge on Saturday. “After we open centres in the Ballygunge and Gariahat areas, traders and hawkers will be told that those with Covid-19 symptoms must get themselves tested at the earliest,” said a CMC official.“A hawker selling wares on a footpath or a trader inside a market talks to multiple customers daily. If a trader contracts the virus from one of the customers, she or he might pass it on to many others. Chances of the virus spreading from such people are much more than those who are mostly staying at home. If a vegetable seller or a fish seller is infected, she or he can go on to infect many of the customers. Hawkers and other traders are our initial target for the antigen test,” the official said.The CMC official said the plan was to conduct at least 100 antigen tests at each of the centres every day. The target is to conduct 1,600 tests across the city daily. “Each centre will remain open at least two days in a week,” the official said.The centres will also collect swab samples for the RT-PCR test for Covid-19, the traditional and more confirmatory test for the coronavirus disease.",2020-07-08 04:50:00
993,Snehal Sengupta,Moderate rains and choked drains swamp Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"The rainfall was moderate on Wednesday but several pockets of Salt Lake and areas off VIP Road still witnessed waterlogging.An official of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said debris, leaves and branches had choked the rainwater drainage channels and gully pits, leading to flooding. To add to the problems, the Kestopur and the Bagjola canals, which drain out accumulated water from Salt Lake and VIP Road, are filled to the brim.The Dum Dum observatory of the Indian Meteorological Department recorded 27.94mm of rain, while the Alipore Met office recorded 33mm of rainfall over 24 hours till 6.30pm on Thursday.However, the showers proved to be enough to swamp several roads in Salt Lake as well as parts of VIP Road on Thursday.In Salt Lake, the Karunamoyee intersection and the Karunamoyee Housing Estate had ankle to knee-deep water, making it tough for motorists and pedestrians to move.Residents of the Karunamoyee Housing Estate and EE Block said they had a harrowing time reaching the nearby markets as well as going to their workplaces.“At least three app cabs cancelled the ride after seeing the water on the road leading to my house,” said Animesh Bhattacharya, a resident of Karunamoyee Housing Estate in ED Block. Similar scenes played out in several other blocks, including FA and AA Blocks.Several places along VIP Road, such as Chinar Park, were flooded on Thursday morning. Residents of housing complexes like Sriram Nagar and Space Town had a harrowing time reaching VIP Road or the Chinar Park crossing. “Every time it rains, this area gets waterlogged. The water doesn’t recede even after the rain stops,” said Shyamal Chaudhuri, who lives in the neighbourhood.A 1km-long stretch of the service road near the Haldiram’s bus stop was under knee to waist-deep water.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had cleaned up their rainwater drainage network after Cyclone Amphan. But the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation did not carry out such an exercise.Devashish Jana, the mayoral council member in charge of drainage at the civic body, said the entire drainage system in Karunamoyee needed to be upgraded. “We will need at least six months to upgrade the drainage network there,” he said. Places along VIP Road, Jana said, are prone to waterlogging because these are low-lying areas. The Bidhannagar civic body and Hidco, which builds infrastructure in New Town, will set up a drainage pumping station near City Centre II to solve the problem of waterlogging in these areas.",2020-07-08 05:01:00
994,Debraj Mitra,Lockdown: Kolkata gym-goers relieved on reopening day - Telegraph India,"A teacher with mobility problems. A youth aspiring to be a professional powerlifter. An insurance sector employee who calls himself a fitness freak.A handful of Calcuttans hit the gym on Thursday, when they reopened after over four months. The attendees were yearning for the places to reopen for different reasons.Arpita Chakraborty, 40, came from her Picnic Garden home to a gym in Ballygunge riding her two-whee-ler. Chakraborty, a school teacher, suffers from severe rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder that leads to joint pain and impairs mobility. She was facing severe challenges in movement when she joined the gym last year. The gym, Endorphins, is known for not being a machine-oriented place.A daily routine of mobility exercises has improved Chakraborty’s condition. “But I have to do it without fail, every day. It is like my personal hygiene,” she said.For the past four months, Chakraborty had been working out at her home.“But working out in a dedicated space is important because of the guidance of a trainer and zero distraction,” she said. Her six-year-old daughter often interrupts her training at home.As the reopening day came close, Kinjal Paul, 22, started becoming restless. Before the lockdown, he used to spend over two hours every day at Devil’s Den, a gym in Salt Lake’s CB Block. Paul has just completed a bachelor’s in business administration but he aspires to a career in powerlifting.He had booked an afternoon slot for Thursday. “I did not realise how the time flew. I did squats, deadlifts and bench-press. It was the first day after four months. So, I did not go overboard,” said Paul.Moderation for Paul is lifting over 130 kilos. He said his usual quota was 170 kilos.Paul had mostly been working out at his Paikpara home for the past four months. “But serious powerlifting needs a lot of equipment. It is difficult to assemble them at home. I used to go to a friend’s place that has some,” said Paul.Some of his family members and friends had cautioned him against going to “a public place when Covid-19 cases are increasing”. But Paul said he was satisfied with the safety measures adopted by the gym.Most gyms had asked members to pre-book slots and come accordingly. They followed a 10 to 15-minute interval between two slots for sanitisation. Equipment inside the gym were being sanitised after every use. Face shields, masks and gloves were provided to the members. “Blocks” were carved out for each user.The guidelines issued by the Centre on Monday said gyms would need to space equipment and individuals six feet apart as a precaution against Covid-19.Many owners had reduced the number of functional equipment. “I used to have six treadmills. I have shifted three to the store room,” said the owner of a gym in New Alipore. Most members avoided public transport to reach the gyms.Himangshu Valechha had booked an hour’s slot from 8.20am at Karma Fitness Studio in Mudiali, which was his regular den before the lockdown. Valechha, an employee of a private insurance firm, considers “fitness to be his religion”.“I was so pumped up once inside the gym. I had been working out regularly inside my house. But there is no mind-muscle synergy. There are too many distractions,” he said.Valechha did shoulder exercises on Thursday.",2020-07-08 05:15:00
995,Sanjay Mandal,Kolkata: Cured of Covid but neighbours need proof - Telegraph India,"“Dear All, This is to inform you that… and family is out of quarantine.”This was the message sent on Thursday to residents of a housing complex in south Calcutta by its welfare association after one of the residents who had tested positive for Covid-19 completed 14 days of isolation.“Please get yourself tested after 14 days. Step out only if the result is negative.”This message was verbally communicated to a resident of a standalone apartment block by the residents’ welfare association when he tried to step out of his flat after completing seven days of isolation following his discharge from a hospital, where he was treated for Covid-19.The first message helped the person who recovered from Covid step out of home without facing any resistance from neighbours. The recipient of the second threatened to go to police.In the absence of any clear communication from the health department, the residents’ welfare associations of many housing complexes and standalone buildings across Calcutta are deciding when a resident will step out after recovering from Covid.A guideline issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research states: “After one week from sample collection or detection of Covid-19 symptoms, if a patient does not have fever and other symptoms for another three days, then no further test will be required and the doctor will discharge him/her with a certificate from the hospital or safe home. The patient must stay under home quarantine for an additional seven days before returning to normal life.”Many people who suffered from Covid told Metro that health department officials had called them up during the period of isolation but did not tell them when they could resume normal life.“I received two calls from the health department. On both occasions, the callers were very polite and wished me good health and speedy recovery. During the first call I was given a number, which the official said I could call ifI developed any symptoms,” said a resident of Kasba, who was discharged from hospital a week back following his recovery from Covid-19.“The second call came a couple of days back. The caller wished me good health before hanging up. He did not tell me whether I could resume normal life,” the man said.The secretary of his building’s residents’ welfare association asked him to get yet another Covid test done and step out only if the report was negative.A Garia resident who has recovered from Covid alleged that members of the residents’ association of his building threatened him after accusing him of stepping out before completing the mandatory quarantine period. He said he had isolated himself at home for seven days after returning from hospital.“I received a call from a Covid patient who was under my observation, requesting me for a certificate that he could end his isolation. I told him he had completed 14 days and could go out but he said his neighbours might create problems,” said public health expert Abhijit Chowdhury.Chowdhury — a mentor of Covid Care Network, an organisation of doctors, government officials and people who have recovered from Covid — said the network was getting calls from people who alleged that residents’ associations were not allowing them to return to normal life.Health department officials said there was a protocol for the callers on how to communicate with Covid patients or those who have recovered from the disease. “Maybe some callers are not telling the recovered person when they can end their quarantine. We are looking into the problem,” an official said.Physician Amitabha Saha said several welfare associations have doctors as members and they were taking the decision after calculating the number of days a person should be in quarantine. “This is beneficial for the patient and their neighbours. A clear communication can dispel confusions,” he said.",2020-07-08 05:19:00
996,Our Special Correspondent,Lockdown: Tax and fee relief for private buses  - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government on Thursday waived all taxes for bus and minibus owners till September 30 and the annual permit fee, which together will provide a relief of around Rs 5,000 for each vehicle.The waiver, with retrospective effect from April 1, came at a time operators of private buses and minibuses have been reeling from the twin blows of a steep hike in the diesel price and a sharp drop in the passenger count because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state cabinet at its meeting at Nabanna on Thursday decided that private bus and minibus operators would not have to pay any tax under the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Act 1979 from April 1 to September 30. They have also been exempted from paying the permit fee this year.If a bus or a minibus owner wants to clear his pending dues till March 31, he or she can do so by August 31 without inviting any penalty for the delay.“We had proposed a relief of Rs 15,000 for bus operators. They (bus operators) gave us this particular proposal. The finance department has accepted it. We have decided to replace the earlier offer with this,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday.Earlier, the chief minister had proposed a grant of Rs 15,000 to 6,000 buses each for three months from July. Mamata had met represen-tatives of the operators at Nabanna on June 26, before announcing the dole, which she said would cost the state exchequer Rs 27 crore.The amount was expected to cushion the financial blow suffered by the operators and enable them to run buses at current fares.The operators refused to accept the offer saying the figure 6,000 (bus count) was discriminatory. Almost all urged the government to revise fares, which they said would be a lasting solution to their problem.Of the 21,000-odd private buses across Bengal, around 7,000 used to ply in Calcutta and its adjoining areas before the lockdown was imposed in March.Almost all operators have been battling financial distress since the diesel price started soaring. In Calcutta, diesel sold at Rs 77.06 a litre on Thursday, up by Rs 11.44 a litre since June. Most operators said fuel comprised almost 60 per cent of their expenditure and the escalating price of diesel had created a problem whose only solution was a fare hike.Private bus operators said they had long been demanding relief in some form from the government. “Only 40 per cent of the buses are plying. Bus owners are struggling to pay EMIs and arrange money for other regular expenses. Even a small relief is a big help for us,” said Tapan Bandyopadhayay, of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates.Transport department officials said a six-month waiver of road tax would help operators save Rs 2,800 for each vehicle. If other taxes are combined, the relief would come to around Rs 5,000 for each bus.“What if someone has already paid a quarterly tax? Will he be eligible for additional relief?” asked Rahul Chatterjee, of the All Bengal Bus Minibus Samanoy Samity.",2020-07-08 05:34:00
997,Subhankar Chowdhury,RKM Vidyamandira: Science olympiads and exams to fetch weightage in undergraduate admissions - Telegraph India,"The Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur will give additional weightage to participants in math Olympiads and national talent search examinations for admission to undergraduate mathematics and physics courses.The college that has featured among the top 11 in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for the past three years did not want to rely only onPlus II board results. The institute has scrapped admission tests this year because of the pandemic. Several top institutions have been trying new ways to pick the best students but no one has so far used performance in Olympiads and talent search exams as a screening layer.Apart from those, performance in mathematics and physical science in Class X board exams and scores in the subjects in the Plus II board exams will be taken into account to select students, Swami Ekachittananda, the officiating principal of the college, said on Thursday.“This year, we are considering a student’s performance in competitions as admissions tests cannot be held. Tests have been scrapped for all subjects and new mechanisms that will test a candidate’s command over the subject have been put in place,” Swami Ekachittananda said.In mathematics, additional weightage will be given for successfully qualifying in the International Mathematical Olympiad and the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad.For physics, the qualification in competitive exams like the National Standard Examination in Physics (NSEP), considered to be the first stage in the selection of students for the International Physics Olympiad, and the National Talent Search Examination (NTSE), will act as a screening layer.In mathematics, marks will be given for the competitive exams in order of preference. Qualification in the International Mathematical Olympiad will fetch 10 marks and in the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad nine marks.The institute will consider nine such competitions. Students will have to send scanned copies of certificates of such exams to mathematicsrkmv@gmail.com on or before August 21.“Last year, the college had considered qualification in these competitions in case a student narrowly missed the subject cut-off. This year we are awarding weightage,” Swami Ekachittananda said.In physics, qualification in competitive exams like the National Standard Examination in Physics, the National Talent Search Examination, and the Jagadis Bose National Science Talent Search, will fetch 10 marks.In case scores are tied, the marks in the competitions will act as a tiebreaker for both mathematics and physics.“Since the screening this year will revolve around board marks, the possibility of scores remaining tied are greater,” Swami Ekachittananda said.In chemistry and industrial chemistry, the student’s performance in the science group and aggregate score at the Class X board exams will be considered, along with Plus II board results.“In physics, chemistry and industrial chemistry, the Class X board results will be considered as the state Higher Secondary council could not hold some of the exams because of the pandemic,” a teacher said. “But the college is not making any specific rule for state board students to give everyone a level playing field.”For English, the Higher Secondary (or equivalent) score in the subject will be considered.The Plus II board aggregate and the mathematics score will be considered for economics.",2020-07-08 05:46:00
998,Subhankar Chowdhury,"IIEST waives mess advance of Rs 17,500 - Telegraph India","Students of the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, will not have to pay the mess advance and water and electricity charges this semester, an institute official said.The decision was taken at a meeting the students’ senate had with institute director Parthasarathi Chakrabarty on Thursday afternoon.Ever since the institute announced that classes will be held online from August 24, students have been demanding that mess and hostel fees be waived as they would not use these facilities, the official said.The Shibpur institute is entirely residential. “The fees will be charged proportionately if the campus reopens this semester,” he said.At the start of the semester, students are required to pay Rs 17,500 as mess advance, Rs 3,000 as mess entrance fee, Rs 1,000 as seat rent, and Rs 800 as electricity and water charges.“In addition, the students activities fee of Rs 500 has been waived and the infrastructure fee has been brought down to Rs 1,000 from Rs 2,500,” director Chakrabarti said.But students will have to pay the hostel maintenance charge of Rs 2,200 and mess establishment fee of Rs 4,000 though they will stay at home this semester.These fees are a must so that members of the hostel staff who are temporary workers continue to get some support during the pandemic.At IIEST, students were asked to vacate hostels in the third week of March after the Centre announced the lockdown.“Chances of the campus reopening this semester are extremely slim. So, why will we pay for the hostel and mess?” a student asked.The institute will issue a notice this week regarding the extent of relaxation.Another institute official said the decision on waiving certain fees at IIT Kharagpur prompted IIEST students to demand a similar relaxation.The Kharagpur institute had waived mess fees and hostel overhead charges, along with some other charges, on July 21, following a demand for exemption from students.The students had cited online classes as the reason behind their demand.The students’ senate — the official representative body of the IIT Kharagpur student community — had written to the dean of students’ affairs, demanding that mess fees and hostel overhead charges be waived.“The move must have motivated our students. Besides, the argument of financial loss cannot be ruled out. Students, though, have to keep paying the tuition fees and examination fees as fixed by the Centre,” the IIEST official said.",2020-07-08 05:55:00
999,Brinda Sarkar,"The New Town Divas: Club offers cycle tours, lessons - Telegraph India","New Town Business Club has three offerings on the anvil for cyclists and aspiring cyclists. The first is for women who would be invited to come together for cycling tours of the township.“This group, called The New Town Divas, will be kickstarted on August 13, 6.30am from the club itself,” says the club’s general manager Col (retd) Indrajit Roy. The women will use the cycle lanes on the street and ride down to the clock tower and then the Unbox Garden underneath Biswa Bangla Gate for tea and snacks. “While we may undertake longer routes later, the focus at the beginning will be to make women feel confident about cycling. Many have not ridden since their school days.”While the tour is free for members, non-members are to pay a token Rs 10 per day. While the women are expected to get their own cycles, the club will keep one or two as standby.The second group, called The New Town Leaders, to be launched on August 14, 6.30am, is for men and women who are in the habit of cycling. “Their tours will be longer. On the first day we shall ride from the clock tower to the Eiffel Tower replica in Eco Park and later we may visit the wetlands.” Rates are the same.The final initiative is cycle training. Primarily for children, the classes will be imparted at the cricket ground near City Centre 2 on Sundays from 4 to 6pm. “The fees will be Rs 200 a month and there is no upper age limit. Adults who wish to learn cycling are welcome,” says Roy.“Since the cycles will be ridden on grass, one would not be hurt much if one falls.” This service will start about a fortnight after the other two.“By encouraging cycling we will be guiding members towards an eco-friendly lifestyle,” says Roy.",2020-07-08 14:22:00
1000,Brinda Sarkar,AJ Block food festival: Let the kids cook - Telegraph India,"If you think the only off-screen activities to keep kids busy during this lockdown are sit-and-draw and building blocks, you should let them cook.If you are still unconvinced, you should have visited AJ Block days before the lockdown. A food festival by juniors had an eight-year-old making Fish Tikia and a six-year-old cooking Chicken Biriyani!“I love eating biryani and wanted to make it for everyone today,” smiled Bhramoree Kar, rattling off the proportion of ghee, salt and food colouring that she added to the dish. “It’s only the layering of rice and chicken that my mother did as it was too heavy for me,” said the student of Class I who wants to become a chef when she grows up.Aranya Majumdar doesn’t understand why he has to learn math when he too wants to become a chef later in life. “A chef of Japanese food,” he adds. “Cooking is an art and this is what should be taught in school.” The Class II student had made Fish Tikia with a twist of mayonnaise and kasundi and all 22 plates sold out.The crowds thronged. Papiya Chakraborty, the lady whose brainchild the fest was, had got a Class XII student Esha Barman to make the announcements and a Class XI student Debargha Choudhury to man the cash counter but the queue became so long that adults had to step in and bail him out.Sampreet Saha’s Dahi Puris were such a hit that he could only scrape up three leftover pieces to serve his last customer instead of four that the others were getting.Mehul Chakraborti had begun his mocktail counter with nine bottles of cola but had to send his aunt rushing to the market for four more when he realised demand would fast exceed supply.
If the kids thought they would get a bite of what they had rustled up, they were so wrong. “Let alone the ghoogni I had made to sell, customers even took away the platter I had kept for display,” said Ambali Kar of Class VII.Nine-year-old Judhajit (Jude) Chakraborty did get a lick of his pani puri-flavoured ice cream but not how you’d imagine it. “I love this ice cream made of tamarind water and pani puri masala but the customers left nothing for me! I only got one lick and that too from a drop that had fallen on the table,” he grumbled. “I understand now how difficult it must be for waiters to control themselves from eating what they serve others at restaurants.”After facing the mad rush of customers, Ambali said she realised how parents must feel at being ordered by children to get tasty food every day.Aditya Sarangi too had new-found respect and empathy for waiters. “It was crazy making sandwiches and answering customers’ queries all at once. From now on, I’ll be patient with waiters when we go out to eat.”While some kids took part in the show for the love of cooking, those like Ronit Das, eight, did so for fun. “I’m not into cooking; I like football. But cooking is a skill we should all pick up, even if only the basics,” said the boy who sold Chicken Roll.Mimi Saha, mother of little Supriyo, was very happy with the Jhal Muri he had rustled up. “For once, we moms are carefree and the kids are tied up,” she laughed.With the money earned from the fest, Ujjesa Barman wanted to buy Barbie dolls. “My father runs the restaurant and catering company Scone at AJ and BJ blocks and he makes delicious snacks for us at home. I like learning cooking from him,” said the Class V student.The kids reportedly helped out in the kitchen when no cooks were allowed to come in the early days of the lockdown.
Chakraborty, who organised the event, was proud of the kids. “None of them could imagine a food fest for children before this but they sat attentively at meetings and listened to rules and guidelines. Kids are capable of a lot but adults usually show no faith in them due to their age. Well, this show proved them wrong!”

1001,The Telegraph,"Japan: Land of rising sun, ramen and oolong - Telegraph India","It was late evening, and we were walking down the streets of Nagoya. My Anime-fanatic friend stopped a stranger and spared no effort in trying to have a complete conversation in Japanese. I rolled my eyes, took a break from scanning random billboards and shop names with my Google Translator, typed out “Where’s the nearest 7-Eleven store?” and held it out to them.We were a team of 10 students and a professor from the department of instrumentation and electronics engineering in Jadavpur University, visiting Nagoya University for the Sakura Science Exchange Programme that is organised and funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency. The intent of the programme was to promote a healthy relationship between the students of the two countries, make us aware of the academics and ongoing research work in our host college, and expose us to the unique and vibrant culture of Japan.In late January this year, we spent a week in Nagoya, one of the country’s most populated cities, famous as the hub of industry and commerce. Every day, we travelled between our hotel and the college on Japan’s immaculately planned subways with colour-coded route lines and unfailing punctuality, and our loud, excited team of 20-somethings soon learnt to blend with a crowd that was soft-spoken and unimaginably disciplined, compared to us Calcuttans.We interacted with the faculty and scholars at the department of agricultural sciences of the university and learnt hands-on about their research on the application of spectroscopic techniques — something that our department also works on rigorously — one of its most notable examples being the development of a complete setup for the quality assessment of tea leaves.After college, we would go out for walks along lines of DVD stores and restaurants. Occasionally, we would stop to appreciate homes depicting the unique Japanese architecture, made of wood and with a minimalistic design.Of course, we tried out the authentic ramen, sushi and other dishes whose names I’ve forgotten by now, and drank lots of oolong tea. Japanese cuisine is more of an acquired taste and I started loving it only towards the end of the trip (by this time, I had also perfected the skill of using chopsticks)!Although Covid-19 hadn’t become such an important part of our lives by then, people could be seen wearing masks in public places, and so did we.Japan boasts of high-rise buildings and there is only an extent to which one gets dazzled by the glitz and allure of modernisation.
As part of the itinerary, we visited a plant factory in Mie Prefecture, which is a quiet place away from the bustling city life. For me, it was a breath of fresh air, the most beautiful part of the trip. On our way, looking out of the train window, we could see a number of beautiful cottages and tiny cafes spread out on either side of the track. It rained that day, adding more colour to the trees lined along the roads.
We were also taken to visit the Nagoya Castle, a popular tourist attraction with historical significance. Built by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1615, it was Japan’s first castle to be declared a national treasure. Large parts of the castle were destroyed during World War II but it has now been beautifully restored, and a replicated version of it is open for visitors.  We also visited the Toyota Automobile Museum, which was a magnificent and spectacular experience. The museum features over a hundred cars from all over the world, with the entire region divided according to eras, tracing the evolution of automobiles from as old as 1936 to the modern-day advancements. Lined with models of the first cars with doors opening in opposite directions to the royal El Dorado Biarritz, it is complete with interesting trivia about each. It’s a treat for car enthusiasts.An Indian meal in JapanThere’s one incident I must talk about. One night, we hunted down an Indian restaurant near us and visited it eagerly, yearning for some spicy dishes that tasted like home. Being the perpetually broke college-goers that we were, we first checked the price list hung outside.The restaurant being a well-known and reputed one in the area, its prices were far beyond our budget. Dejected, we stood at the door. As we were about to leave, the owner came out, invited us in and asked us the reason for our hesitation. What followed was the perfect Indian meal and a happy conversation with a Delhi-ite. As we thanked him later, he bid us a warm farewell and said: “Apne logo ko bhukha kaise rakhte?”Japan feels a little closer home to us Bengalis because our favourite person, Rabindranath Tagore, visited the country years ago, made friends, and was loved by its people. On our last day, my friend sang a Rabindrasangeet and I danced to another (our saris attracted quite a few stares on the subway!) The audience was delighted and curious and a student came up to me and asked: “Does every Indian know how to sing and dance?”Exploring a new land with friends by our side — Japan has been an unforgettable experience for us. If I had to describe the country in a word, I’d borrow it from their language — shibui — subtle, simple, modest beauty.",2020-07-08 14:56:00
1002,Brinda Sarkar,Before you bring a pup home - Telegraph India,"With everyone home during the lockdown, many families are bringing home pet dogs. But there’s a lot to consider before making this big decision. Paramita Das, canine trainer and behaviourist and a resident of FE Block, held a webinar recently to address the issues. Here’s the first installment of what she had to say-

While a dog will enhance your life, you have to understand that he is not a toy. He has emotions and his own likes and dislikes and getting a dog is a big responsibility. Here are some pointers to consider before becoming a pet parent-The average life span of your dog would be 12-14 years so ask if you can make that long a commitment. Do you have the time, money and will you make the effort?Time- Keeping a pet means grooming him, training him, taking him to the vet for his shots and check-ups. Grooming is easier for short-haired dogs like Dachshund and Labradors but they will still need nails clipped, ears and anal glands cleaned periodically.
You must also be up for unpleasant jobs like inspecting your dog’s poop to report to the doctor and checking his coat for ticks and fleas.Money- The pet will have his share of expenses. It is sad that many dogs are being abandoned during the lockdown as their pet parents have lost their jobs. So be careful about your decision.Support system- Getting a dog has to be a family decision. Don’t take home a pup if your husband detests them. Yes, most of the time the person who hates the pup comes to love him the most after six months but what if this isn’t the case in your family?
What if you live alone and get Covid? Who would look after the dog for you? For that matter, who will look after him when you go for a vacation? Will you keep him in a creche, will a family member stay back with him or will you only go on pet-friendly holidays? What if you get a job out of town? Your dog has left his species to be with you and are you thinking of leaving him behind?Allergies- Get your family members tested for allergies before bringing home a dog.While most people melt seeing a puppy’s eyes, a pup comes with caveats. His baby teeth will be needle-sharp and you will be bitten as he grows.Your expensive shoes may get chewed up and you will be stepping on his pee everywhere till he gets toilet-trained.That way, adopting an older dog will be easier as he will be toilet-trained but you’ll miss out on the fun of watching a pup grow. There’s no right answer for this but you have to sure of which you want.The right ageYou must never separate a puppy from the mother before 60 days (eight weeks).
For the first 60 days of its life, a puppy is learning “primary socialisation” from his mother and siblings. He gets immunity from his mother’s milk too. After about four weeks (30 days) the mother needs “me time” and leaves the pups from time to time to play by themselves. When she returns, if the pups jump at her to have milk, she growls in a way that trains them. It teaches them that they are not to jump unless the other person wants it.If the pup bites too hard while feeding, again, the mother smacks him. The pup understands that he should not dig his teeth hard on skin.
If this had happened on a human, the human would have thrown his hands and legs in the air and created such a fuss that the pup would think biting was a game. The best trainer for the pup is his mother and even the best human trainer comes nowhere near her.After about seven weeks the mother starts rejecting the pups and this is the right time to bring home one. This is when “secondary socialisation” starts (to be discussed next week).Check the mother- After about seven weeks, the mother should let you touch the puppies. If not, she may have a behavioural problem, which may be passed on to her children. The mother should be friendly and not display visible signs of genetic problems. For instance, if she limps she may have hip dysplasia, which again may be passed on to her kids.Health and behaviour- Yes, even the sick puppies need to go somewhere but they need homes that are committed to caring for a weak dog. The average person should check for overall good health — the pup shouldn’t be skinny or with a poor coat.As for which pup to pick from a litter, it requires detailed study. A first time pet parent, for instance, is better off not picking a dominant or excessively timid puppy as he lacks experience to raise him. It would be easier if the pup’s nature compliments your and your family’s temperament.Living conditions- In all my years of experience, I have come across very few cases of genetic aggression. It is mostly “learnt aggression”, that can arise from childhood.  So if there are five pups, there should be more than five water bowls and toys for them. Then the pups do not need to fight for resources and are not prone to food aggression or possessiveness.The sleeping area should be clean, hygienic and the toilet area must have a different ground texture, even if it is simply paper. That is how the mother teaches her pups where to do their business.Getting an adult dogSometimes a family can adopt a dog that is given up another family due to some reason. Such dogs fit in seemlessly in their new homes; actually it depends on the new family.However, before taking in an adult dog a family should run behavioural tests to see if he is possessive, aggressive or has fear issues. For these, it is best to consult a professional.Once the pup comes homeFrom the age of 60 days (eight weeks) to about 20 weeks, the pup’s sense of smell, sight and touch is developing rapidly and he is curious about his environment. Ideally you should expose him to 100 new experiences every month at this stage.
Throw steel vessels on the floor, open and shut umbrellas before him, burst fire crackers, play Rabindrasangeet and rock music….Otherwise your summer-born dog may panic on Diwali night or in winter, when he sees people wearing hoodies.You also need 100 new people to handle him in this period. Sadly, we live in an age when we have 5,000 friends on Facebook but none that we can call to play with our pup.Nonetheless, allow the puppy to explore. Unless the pup explores now, his curiosity will get replaced by fear later and you’ll need a behaviourist to help him out of it. You’ll complain that he bites but you won’t realise that he bites out of fear and not aggression.   Impose limitsYour dog is learning from his first day and unless you teach him what’s acceptable, he will be teaching you his rules. This is especially the case with headstrong breeds like Beagles (more on this later).The more restrictions you put on your dog early in life, the more freedom he’ll enjoy later and vice versa. Otherwise, if you let him tear things and jump over people in his early days, you’ll have to keep him tied up later on when guests come calling.It’s all right to keep your dog in a crate for a couple of hours but don’t let it be only to discipline him. Make the crate a den that dog loves - make it is big, well-ventilated and enriching. Keep chew toys or ones home-made toys made of old towels and jeans.Choose a breed that suits your lifestyle. Spend time researching breeds and don’t just pick one up as it looks cute.Activity level- Do you sleep till 10? Do you watch TV all evening and want your dog to sit next to you or are you a runner who wants to take your dog on treks? Do you have kids at home or adults?These questions are important in picking a breed. People think Labradors and Golden Retrievers make great companions but this is not what they were bred for. These dogs were bred to retrieve fishermen and hunter’s catch. So you may want to relax in the evening but yourLab is energetic and wants to play then. Mind you, not giving your dog exercise amounts to cruelty.People think they can make Calcutta comfortable for a Siberian Husky by air-conditioning his room but that’s not enough. These dogs were bred for endurance, to survive miles in the snow. To keep a Husky healthy you have you wake up at 4.30am and take him for a long run before it gets hot. Can you do that?After the lockdown we all know how frustrating it is to be stuck indoors. This is how your dog feels if you don’t let him out.Flooring- Breeds like Labs and Golden Retrievers are prone to a condition called hip dysplasia. Pups of these breeds should not be running on marble floors, that can be slippery. Grown-up dogs with this condition should not be walking on marble either.Games- Beagles are extremely popular as they are compact-sized with short coats but they are also stubborn. You have to design mentally stimulating games for them else they’ll get frustrated and destructive. Beagles are scent hounds and so they see the world with their noses, even more than other dogs. To keep a Beagle happy you can hide his toys in the house or in the park and ask him to find them.Training- Should you want breeds like German Shepherd Dogs, Rottweilers and Belgian Malinois, you must train them well. These breeds were meant to rear sheep and cattle and nipped the legs of these animals when they tried to go astray. Unless trained, these dogs may bite children they see running. One need not always hire a professional trainer, you can do it yourself but you need to learn it yourself.While many homes are taking in pets now, it is not without challenges.  No touch and feel- Many breeders are not allowing people to go over and see the litters. But it is not enough to choose a puppy by simply seeing his video. How will you check if his living conditions are clean? The deadly parvovirus is doing the rounds the now but how will you check if the pup is healthy on camera?Lack of socialisation- Secondly, even if you get home a puppy, how to give him 100 new experiences and 100 new people to interact with every month? The best you can do is dress up in different get-ups yourself. Wear a hat, shawl, lungi, hoodies, crawl on the floor, stand on a chair… even if your smell is the same, at least you’re looking different to your dog.
While exposing him to these new experiences, do not force him to go near it. Allow him time and distance and he will explore and overcome the fear himself.Separation anxiety- Dogs are getting used to their pet parents being around all the time now but what will happen when the lockdown is finally lifted? You will go to work, movies, wedding ceremonies and your dog will be miserable home alone.  
The solution is to not to allow him to around you all the time. Encourage him to relish some me-time. In fact, right from the day he comes, don’t spend the first 48 hours glued to him. He’ll cry for a bit but then quieten up. Otherwise he’s training you to be at his beck and call.
You can keep your dog home alone for six to seven hours safely as that’s how long he can hold his bladder.",2020-07-08 15:05:00

1004,The Telegraph,Magic: Tricks of trade to cast a spell - Telegraph India,"Ahili Das, a resident of EE Block who goes by the stage name of Magicianne Lee, takes a magic class for readers to learn from and impress others with. Like The Telegraph, she too has just turned 15On the 15th birth anniversary of The Telegraph, I feel like sharing some magic with you. Yes, you too can do magic!“Don’t be a wallflower in your friend’s next birthday party; learn magic for fun and entertainment,” my magic mentor Solyl Kundu used to tell me and now I say the same to you.The type of magic I shall teach here is called close-up magic in magicians’ jargon and is normally done with everyday objects available at home without having to step out in the middle of lockdown.However, let me first share the three golden rules of magic-1. Never share the secret of the magic with anyone.
2. Never tell the audience in advance what you are going to do.
3. Never repeat a trick for the same audience.
Finally, a magician’s mantra is practice, practice and practice. Practice will make your moves smooth. So learn, practise and entertain your family and friends.The magic: You will be turning an ordinary drinking straw so strong that you can pierce a big potato with it.
What the audience sees: Use a few paper straws and a big fresh potato. Ask someone in your audience to try to pierce the potato with any straw. They will find that it is not possible as the straw will bend or break.Finally, you take another straw from the bunch and announce that you will turn it into a Karateka and pierce the potato. And then do as you say.The secret: Carefully but casually, hold the straw with your right hand curling the fingers around the straw and the right thumb covering the top opening of the straw as shown in the figure above. Take care that no one notices your thumb covering the top hole of the straw.  At the same time hold the potato stationary in the left hand about 10 inches or so below the straw. Stab the potato as fast you can while secretly bending the end of the straw, thereby trapping the air inside and making the straw strong enough to pass through the potato.The magic: Turn a glass upside down and watch it stay in the glass.
What the audience sees: Use a glass tumbler and a cotton handkerchief. Spread the handkerchief covering the mouth of the tumbler.Then with your fingers, poke a small well into the handkerchief over the mouth of the tumbler. Pour some water into the well to fill the tumbler almost to the top.Now, stretch the handkerchief tightly over the mouth of the tumbler, holding it down at the sides over the glass and quickly turn the glass over. The water will stay in the glass. Finally after a few moments, turn the tumbler back again.The secret: Frankly, there’s no secret in this magic which is self-working. When making the little well and pouring water in the glass, stretch the hanky as explained and the water will make a film and over the surface of the damp cloth and the water will not pass through.The magic: You shall make a knot in a handkerchief without letting go of the ends.What the audience sees: Make your presentation interactive by asking for an assistant from the audience. Ask the lucky audience member for a gent’s handkerchief and tell him/ her to tie a knot on it without letting go of the ends. He won’t be able to (unless he reads this article!) Now you take the handkerchief and put a knot in it without letting go of your hands.The secret: A cotton gents’ handkerchief is needed. It can be any other cotton handkerchief too but it has to be big enough. Now twist it along its length so it becomes rope-like as shown above.Now, cross your arms as shown in the picture above.Then ask your assistant to put the two ends of the handkerchief in the fingers of yours both hands as shown in the picture above.Now with a jerk, uncross your hands and surprise! There is a knot in the centre of the hanky as shown in the last picture.Practice repeatedly so you can do this faster and smoothly.The magic: A rubber that you place on the base of two fingers will skip to two other fingers.What the audience sees: The magician takes a rubber band and puts it at the base of his two fingers as shown in the picture right.Then he makes a fist as shown in the picture right.As he reopens his fist the rubber band magically jumps to his other fingers as shown in the picture right.

The secret: Get a couple of rubber bands. Make sure they are tight.Now note the pictures below, from the magician’s point of view —A) Put the rubber band around the base of your two fingers on your left hand towards the left side, as shown in picture.
B) Then close your hand by pulling the rubber band but secretly put all your fingers into the band. The audience will think you have just pulled the band to check the tension. While doing this movement say: “This band is tight enough” as shown  in picture.
C) Now, chant your magic spell. In the meantime note your fingers’ position as shown in the next picture.
D) After chanting the magic spell, quickly open your fingers and the effect will be seen in the picture.
The secret moves should be done in a fraction of a second. Practice well and your audience will be left speechless.Effect: Count off a number of cards from a deck of cards, and the rest of cards put aside. Any one of the packets is turned face up and put on the other face-down packet.Next, shuffle the packets together, intermixing the cards face up and face-down. The cards will show a mixed group of face up and face down cards. You can even offer the cards to anyone for shuffling. After receiving the cards back, place it behind your back for a few moments and bring it forth. Place the deck on the table.Announce that within a split second you have been able to make two packets, one face up and the other face down. Moreover, the face-up cards in each packet will be the same as in the other pack.Now the cards are divided again into two piles, both are spread out to show that if the first pile has four face up cards, the second pile too has four face-up cards.Knowhow: Count off 20 or 30 cards — the number does not matter as long as the numbers is even.The audience need not know the number of cards. You can place your little finger between cards as you are counting to make the piles even.                                                                                        Now divide cards in two packets, turn one of them face up and intermix the cards in any manner. You may even hand out the cards to a spectator for further shuffling.You now take the cards and place them behind your back. All you need to do is count half the cards off the top of the deck with your right hand.For instance, if the total number of cards was 20 count off 10 cards.The remaining 10 cards in your left hand are turned over.Both packets are brought in front and placed on table. The trick is done. All that remains to be done is to spread the packets and count the face up cards. The face up cards in both packets will tally.Here is a magic that is “sure fire”, no set-ups. It can be done with any deck and is very simple to perform. Enjoy friends.",2020-07-08 17:07:00

1006,"Kinsuk Basu, Monalisa Chaudhuri, Subhajoy Roy",Family rescues woman molested inside car in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A 31-year-old woman was allegedly molested by an acquaintance inside his car late on Saturday night and then thrown out onto EM Bypass, police said on Sunday.A mother travelling in another car with her family responded to the cry for help from inside the car at 11.50pm and got off to help the victim, a bank employee.But Nilanjana Chatterjee, the woman who had stopped to help, was left with a fractured leg and gash in the head when the assailant’s Honda City hit her during his hasty bid to flee.The bank employee, allegedly molested in the car near the Ruby intersection, had a swelling in the head from a wound and face injuries.Nilanjana was returning home with husband Deep Satpati and their daughter from her mother's birthday dinner at the Abhyudoy Housing Complex off EM Bypass at Anandapur.When the couple heard a woman scream for help from a car behind them on an otherwise deserted stretch, Satpati pulled over. “I realised that as a mother, I had to help someone who is not much older than my daughter,” Nilanjana, who is in hospital, told The Telegraph later.Satpati had positioned his Maruti Alto in a way that the Honda City would be forced to slow down. “Probably realising he was trapped, the man opened the front door and pushed the woman out,” a police officer said.“The road was deserted,"" Satpati recalled. “Nilanjana got off and walked to the left side of the Honda City, where the woman had been thrown out. As the Honda City made a U-turn to escape, one of its front wheels passed over Nilanjana’s left leg and the car’s nose hit her head, leaving her with a deep cut.”Satpati added: “Everything happened so fast that I couldn’t note down the car’s number.”Officers said the victim had told the police she had recently met the accused, who had introduced himself as Amitabha Bose, and had gone out for a drive in his car on Saturday night.Investigators have detained a man in connection with the case.The police have learnt that the woman hails from north Bengal and lives in rented lodgings in the city.They said she had told the police that trouble began when she asked to be dropped home. “According to the woman’s statement, she could sense danger when the man refused to take her home right away. As the vehicle was passing in front of the Abhyudoy Housing Complex, the woman again sternly asked him to drop her home,” an officer at Anandapaur police station said.The man then allegedly molested her and hit her, prompting her to cry out for help.Nilanjana said the victim was shivering in fear as she held her tightly. “I tried consoling her even after the car ran over one of my legs.”With both women crying in pain, Satpati dialled 100 to alert the police. Officers from Anandapur police station arrived quickly, while a traffic sergeant arranged for an ambulance.Sources said footage from the spot purportedly shows a Honda City passing a housing complex in one direction and, about a minute later, passing it again from the opposite direction at high speed.An official at the Ruby General Hospital said doctors had recommended that the woman undergo a CT scan and an X-ray but she refused and was allowed to leave in the presence of the police.He said Nilanjana had suffered fractures in her left tibia and fibula and would need surgery.",2020-07-09 03:00:00
1007,Snehal Sengupta,Neglected lights put Salt Lake at theft risk  - Telegraph India,"Five theft attempts at Karunamoyee Housing Estate in Salt Lake’s ED block over the past few nights have left residents jittery. While three theft attempts took place on Saturday night, two were reported on the night of August 31.Residents said the street lights damaged by Cyclone Amphan on May 20 are yet to be repaired or replaced. The neighbourhood plunges into darkness at night, making it easier for thieves to strike.On Saturday night, Soham Chakraborty, a resident of ED block, said he saw a man with a backpack climb over the main iron gate of a building that his flat overlooks.He said he was talking on his cellphone while standing near a window of his third-floor flat when he saw the man try to jump over the locked gate. “I immediately started shouting and the man ditched his attempt at scaling the gate and ran,” Chakraborty said.Another resident said she saw a man with a backpack slung over his shoulder scale the boundary wall of the complex and run away.Around midnight last Monday, corporate trainer Neena A. Ghosh Roy heard a noise and got up to investigate. Ghosh stays in a flat that is undergoing renovation. “Although it was dark, I could see that one of the windows of the room facing the elevator shaft was open and a man was peering inside. I immediately started shouting and the man disappeared. It was very scary,” said Ghosh.Alerted by her screams, Ghosh’s daughter and husband rushed in and called the police.When cops arrived and looked around the flat, they found a couple of slippers near the landing of the elevator shaft. “In all likelihood the man had climbed up the bamboo scaffolding put in place to facilitate construction work,” said an officer of Bidhannagar East police station.Later the same night, Sanghamitra Mukherjee, 69, heard a rustling sound coming from outside the bedroom of her ground-floor flat in an E Block building of Karunamoyee Housing Estate.“I woke up and walked out. The construction of a new wing along with an elevator is on at our building and I saw that somebody had been pulling out plastic sheets covering the scaffolding. I raised an alarm but the person ran away,” said Mukherjee, a former principal of Lady Brabourne College.She said they were living in fear as the area around their building has been plunging into darkness after sundown since Amphan damaged street lights on May 20.Sudhir Saha, the mayoral council member in charge of lights and parks of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said the contractor who repaired lights in the area had fallen sick. ""Besides, most of his men have gone back home to Bihar. We are making do with very few people. I will ensure that the lights are repaired in the next few days,"" said Saha.The police are probing the theft attempts but have not been able to ascertain whether it was the same person or gang behind all.Several residents said police patrolling inside the housing estate was lax. “There is a police barracks on top of the Karunamoyee Municipal Market but... there is no patrolling at all,” said a resident who did not wish to be named.A senior officer of the Bidhannagar Commissionerate said that they would intensify patrolling inside the housing complex.",2020-07-09 03:21:00
1008,Kinsuk Basu ,Saviour recounts tale of horror - Telegraph India,"Deep Satpati, a private firm employee, his wife Nilanjana Chatterjee and their daughter were returning to their home in a residential complex on the EM Bypass near the Prince Anwar Shah Road connector crossing on Saturday night when they heard a woman screaming from inside a Honda City car. Deep stopped his Maruti Suzuki Alto car, blocking the way of the Honda City, while Nilanjana got down to see what had happened.  Nilanjana, who is in hospital with a fractured shin bone,  and Deep narrated their experience to Metro on Sunday:Nilanjana ChatterjeeWhen I heard a shrill voice crying for help at that hour of the night, I realised it was a woman. It immediately made me think of my daughter, seated with us in the car. She is 23 years old and we have brought her up with lots of love and care. I realised that as a mother, I had to help someone who is not much older than my daughter.I asked Deep to stop the car at any cost. It was coming from behind us. At that hour, Anandapur didn’t have too many people on the road. The headlights seemed to blaze through the darkness and as the car caught up, the screams of help became more loud. It was a Honda City and a woman was shouting from inside the car.Deep pulled back and parked the Alto across the road. The Honda City stopped and one of the front doors was flung open. A woman was pushed out and she fell on the road.When I reached her, she held me. The woman was weeping and she  kept saying “amake baachaan”. I realised I had to protect her as a mother.I think I will be back on my feet again. But at least I have been able to save the dignity of someone who is almost like my daughter. That is the only solace for me despite the excruciating pain in my leg.  After dumping the  woman, the driver suddenly pulled back and took a U-turn. The left front wheel struck my wife’s shin bone and the car’s bonnet hit her head. Nilanjana slumped on the road. Her head had a deep gash and it was bleeding.By the time I could gather myself and I was about  take down the car's number, the Honda City had sped away.Both the women were crying in pain. I dialled 100 and was connected to Anandapur police station. A police team reached. I realised I had to carry my wife and the woman to a hospital. So I ran to Ruby General Hospital, the one that was nearest to me at that hour.At the hospital gates, the guards said they did not have any ambulance to help me. I re-dialled 100 and broke down. I told the officer, crying, that my wife and another woman needed to be admitted to a hospital and there was no ambulance in sight.The officer then connected to a sergeant of Kasba Traffic Guard. He arranged for an ambulance — KARMA (Kolkata Accident Rescue and Medical Attention) — from Parama Island. I admitted the two to Ruby Hospital.The shin bone has suffered a compound fracture and Nilanjana has received  stitches on her head.Late on Sunday evening, doctors told me she has tested negative for Covid and her operation is slated around 11 on Monday morning.        The woman told me she worked in a private bank in Calcutta. She said: “Aami aapnake shob rokom sahajjyo korbyo. Kintu amar identity ta reveal korben na, please (I will help you in every way). Please don’t reveal my identity).”Even as I tried pacifying her, I realised that it could have been my daughter. If, as a daughter’s father, I don’t come forward to help another woman, who will?Nilanjana and I have this habit of reaching out. Around four years ago, we had gone out for a drive at night. While driving down near VIP Bazar opposite Calcutta International School, we found a car stuck on the divider on the Bypass. We stopped and reached the driver. The man said he was chased by a car and his car smashed into the divider. Even as he was stuck there, some miscreants snatched his bracelet and other valuables. We reached the man to his house in Triangular Park. The next morning, he called up and said: “Please forget the incident. Nothing had happened to me.”",2020-07-09 03:30:00
1009,Subhajoy Roy,Waste split order for Kolkata complexes - Telegraph India,"All housing complexes in the city have to segregate waste at source or pay a fine, says solid waste management bye-laws for Calcutta that the state government notified last month.The bye-laws also make it compulsory for anyone organising a gathering of 100 or more people in an “unlicensed place”, which can be a house or a ground in the locality, to inform the Calcutta Municipal Corporation about the event. Community halls are not on the list of “unlicensed” places.The organisers of such events must ensure that waste is segregated before it is handed over to municipal solid waste cleaners.The residents’ welfare associations of housing complexes, with help from the CMC, have to create a mechanism for waste segregation, a civic official said. The civic body will implement the bye-laws.“All resident welfare and market associations shall, in partnership with KMC, ensure segregation of waste at source by the generators, facilitate collection of segregated waste in separate streams, handover recyclable material to either the authorised waste pickers or the authorised recyclers,” says Chapter III of the bye-laws.The waste has to be segregated into three categories and put in different bins -- biodegradable or wet waste in green bins, non-biodegradable or dry waste in blue bins and domestic hazardous waste in black bins.A housing complex that does not segregate waste will be fined Rs 300 the first time, Rs 500 the second time and Rs 700 for every subsequent violation. “We will not fine a complex without giving it the time and opportunity to introduce the segregation culture,” a CMC official said.Any individual who holds a gathering of 100 or more people and does not segregate waste will be fined Rs 200 the first time, Rs 300 the second time and Rs 400 for every subsequent violation.Biodegradable waste will be collected by CMC teams every morning. “Agencies empanelled with the state pollution control board will collect domestic hazardous waste and non-biodegradable waste. We will provide contact details of the agencies to the residents’ welfare associations,” the official said.“Only a handful of complexes segregate waste. The rest dump all kinds of waste together,” the official said.",2020-07-09 03:31:00
1010,Sanjay Mandal,Foreign flight plan for Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Several airlines have scheduled international flights to Calcutta following the state government’s approval to operate non-chartered flights from other countries, provided only those who test negative for Covid-19 are allowed to board the aircraft.In July, the Bengal government had asked the civil aviation ministry to stop evacuation flights from international destinations after hundreds of passengers had refused to go to a paid quarantine centre after landing in Calcutta and gone home instead.Any flight from an international destination needs a no-objection certificate from the state government.“The state government is giving approvals to airlines applying to operate incoming international flights with the condition that passengers have to test negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before departure. Once all passengers are booked and their test results available, the airline has to upload the data on the state government portal,” said an official of a private airline.“Several airlines are applying for slots…. Our infrastructure in the international section is ready,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya.Airport and airlines officials said the state government was giving approvals for evacuation as well as air transport bubble flights. SpiceJet and Emirates have opened bookings for flights between Calcutta and Dubai under the air-transport-bubble arrangements, said airport officials.Air transport bubbles are temporary arrangements between two countries to restart commercial passenger flights because regular international flights are suspended as a precaution against Covid-19.A civil aviation ministry official said to book a seat on an evacuation flight under the Vande Bharat scheme, mostly operated by Air India, passengers need approval from the central government. “But in air-transport-bubble flights, anybody can book a seat,” said the official.“We have opened bookings for flights under air-transport-bubble between Calcutta and Dubai on September 17, 19, 24 and 26. We are expecting good bookings,” said Debjit Ghosh, regional sales head (east), SpiceJet.Airport sources said Emirates airline, too, had applied for slots for three flights in September.Metro had in August reported that airlines and travel agents’ associations had appealed to the state government to allow resumption of international flights.Initially, the state government was allowing chartered flights to operate.“Tickets on chartered flights are expensive and many cannot afford. A seat on a chartered flight from Dubai to Calcutta would cost around Rs 70,000. But on a flight on the same route under air transport bubble, the one-way fare is around Rs 25,000 and on some days, even less,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.",2020-07-09 03:34:00
1011,Subhankar Chowdhury,Jadavpur University plans home reach to bridge divide - Telegraph India,"Jadavpur University is planning to deliver question papers of end-semester exams to and collect answer scripts from the homes of students who lack a smart device or Internet connectivity, an official said.The other students will receive the questions through group email or WhatsApp and send the answers through these services.The possible models were discussed at the faculty council meeting of arts and science on Sunday. “The models will have to be approved by the university’s exam board, which will meet this week,’’ the official said.The Supreme Court in a recent judgment set aside academic institutes’ decision to publish results on the basis of weightage to the performance in previous semesters and scores in internal assignments. The court upheld the UGC’s directive that graduating students have to write an examination.Since students could not be asked to come to the campus to write the test because of the Covid-19 pandemic, JU is thinking of innovative models such as sending employees to the houses of students struggling with poor Net connectivity to deliver question papers and collect answer scripts. “The exams will have to be held overcoming the digital divide,’’ the head of a department said.JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said: ’The exam board is likely to meet on Monday or Tuesday. An elaborate arrangement will be made so the students do not face any problem writing their papers.”A student may not have access to a computer or smartphone because of financial constraints or may have connectivity issues in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan, which flattened large stretches of the Sunderbans and other places in south Bengal, a JU official said.The university could send men in vehicles to the houses of students living in adjacent districts such as North and South 24-Parganas to deliver question papers and collect answer scripts. If a student lives in far-off places like Birbhum or Bankura, employees will travel by train.The university has students from Kashmir, which has been facing problems over Internet connection since it lost its special status in August last year.Those who have access to the Internet will receive questions by email and WhatsApp and have two hours to write the answers. The answers will have to be sent back the same way.“They will have another hour to send the answers through the same services. If required, a student can write the answers on a script and get the copies scanned or take photos of the scripts on the mobile camera and send them through email or WhatsApp. That’s why an hour is being given to send the answers,’’ a teacher at the university said.Jadavpur University is planning to deliver question papers of end-semester exams to and collect answer scripts from the homes of students who lack a smart device or Internet connectivity, an official said.The other students will receive the questions through group email or WhatsApp and send the answers through these services.The possible models were discussed at the faculty council meeting of arts and science on Sunday. “The models will have to be approved by the university’s exam board, which will meet this week,’’ the official said.The Supreme Court in a recent judgment set aside academic institutes’ decision to publish results on the basis of weightage to the performance in previous semesters and scores in internal assignments.

An elaborate arrangement will be made so the students do not face any problem writing their papers.”A student may not have access to a computer or smartphone because of financial constraints or may have connectivity issues in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan, which flattened large stretches of the Sunderbans and other places in south Bengal, a JU official said.The university could send men in vehicles to the houses of students living in adjacent districts such as North and South 24-Parganas to deliver question papers and collect answer scripts. If a student lives in far-off places like Birbhum or Bankura, employees will travel by train.The university has students from Kashmir, which has been facing problems over Internet connection since it lost its special status in August last year.Those who have access to the Internet will receive questions by email and WhatsApp and have two hours to write the answers. The answers will have to be sent back the same way.“They will have another hour to send the answers through the same services. If required, a student can write the answers on a script and get the copies scanned or take photos of the scripts on the mobile camera and send them through email or WhatsApp. That’s why an hour is being given to send the answers,’’ a teacher at the university said.",2020-07-09 03:36:00
1012,Snehal Sengupta,Mosquito traps in New Town - Telegraph India,"The New Town authorities are installing four “mosquito magnets” in open public places in all three action areas in an attempt to bolster their efforts to fight dengue, an official of the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) said.Such a device releases a mix of propane and carbon dioxide to attract female mosquitoes and trap them.The NKDA had conducted a pilot study by installing a device in a park in the township. “A vector control team and an entomologist constantly monitored the device. It was found that the device was quite effective in keeping the mosquito population in check. After that we decided to install more such devices,” the official said.One of the four mosquito traps has been set up in Eco Park. The others will be installed in the open-air theatre of Nazrul Tirtha, the lawn of Rabindra Tirtha and in Eco Urban Village. “All these are open public places. We do not want visitors to these places to be inconvenienced by mosquitoes and exposed to the threat of being infected by the dengue virus,” the official said.The dengue virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.NKDA chairman Debashis Sen said they had embarked on the project as newer technology needed to be adopted in the fight against dengue. “The fight against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is quite difficult as they can breed in very small pools of water. We need all the help we can get and these devices have proved to be quite effective,” Sen said.An entomologist at NKDA said the device released small bursts of carbon dioxide at fixed intervals. Female mosquitoes get drawn by the smell of carbon dioxide and head towards the device, which has a concealed net attachment. ""Once they fall inside the net attachment, they die,” the entomologist said. Propane acts as propellant for carbon dioxide.The NKDA is also clearing vacant plots of garbage and bushes and cleaning drains regularly to bolster the fight against the winged menace, an NKDA official said. A daily report on plot-by-plot survey, cleaning of canals, spraying of larvicides and awareness campaign is being filed by vector control teams and their supervisors.",2020-07-09 03:39:00
1013,Subhajoy Roy,Covid: 2-week comorbidity survey starts today - Telegraph India,"A survey to identify Calcuttans with comorbidity will begin from Monday. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will complete the survey in its 144 wards in 14 days, a CMC official said on Saturday.The surveyors will visit households on Sundays and on days of total lockdown and on holidays, too, the official said.The surveyors will record a person’s name, age, contact number, and if he/she has cancer, diabetes, heart or kidney disease, hypertension, respiratory disease, liver disease or tuberculosis.The surveyors will carry forms with them to mark if a respondent has any of these diseases, the official said. If the respondent has any other disease, he/she can mention that.“We will not take any other details like how long a person has had the disease. The surveyors will only check the box against the disease a person has,” the official said.These diseases impact the working of vital organs and a new infection can create more trouble for a person, Anirban Dalui, a public health specialist, said. “Some of the diseases that are not mentioned in the form can be psoriasis that impacts the joints and rheumatological diseases. Respondents should tell surveyors about their chronic diseases, if any.”Metro had on Wednesday reported that the CMC would conduct a comorbidity survey from next week. The start date had not been decided then.On Friday, a webinar was held to discuss the modalities of the survey and the start date was finalised. Medical officers in charge of the CMC’s health services in each of the 144 wards attended the webinar.“Since more people stay at home on holiday or lockdown days, we felt there is no point taking a break on these days. On a weekday, we may not get all members of a family,” said an official.The CMC will deploy over 3,000 health workers for the survey. Once the survey is over, the records will be digitised. The records will be available with the state health department as well as the doctors of the CMC.When information about someone testing positive for Covid-19 reaches the borough health officer or the ward medical officer — both of whom are doctors — they will check the database to see whether the person has comorbidities, the official said.“When someone with comorbidity tests positive, the ward medical officer will be extra cautious. If it is found that the person is aged over 70 and has comorbidities, the medical officer may advise hospitalisation,” a CMC doctor said.",2020-07-09 03:41:00
1014,Snehal Sengupta,Tiger claims third victim in four days - Telegraph India,"A fisherman who was part of a team that had ventured inside the Sunderbans forests to catch crabs died after being attacked by a tiger while he was cooking on the bank of a creek on Sunday morning, a forest official said.This was the third death from tiger attack in the Sunderbans in four days.The official said Gopal Baidya, 57, and two other men had left Satjelia village in the Gosaba block, South 24-Parganas, on a small country boat to catch crabs in the narrow creeks of the mangrove delta.Baidya was killed by the tiger in the Jhila 6 forest. Two other men lost their lives in the same forest area after being mauled by tigers on Thursday and Friday.Forest department officials said the body of Baidya could not be recovered as the tiger had dragged him deep inside the mangroves.“The tiger attacked Baidya from behind. The other fishermen tried to scare the animal off but it dragged Baidya deep inside the forest,” an official said.V.K. Yadav, the chief wildlife warden of Bengal, said: ""We are tracking the developments closely and taking all measures. Fishermen have been alerted and we always ask them not to get off their boats and step on banks or embankments,” said Yadav.The Sunderbans field director, Tapas Das, said the men, like others, had ventured into a narrow creek to catch crabs. According to Das, the forest department carries out regular awareness drives and requests those venturing out into the forest not to catch fish or crabs in the creeks as the tigers can easily swim across and attack them.“The creeks offer more in terms of catch but fishing or trapping crabs there is extremely risky,” said Das.",2020-07-09 03:43:00
1015,Subhankar Chowdhury,IIEST survey lays bare digital divide  - Telegraph India,"A section of students at the IIEST could not attend online classes in the last semester because of poor Internet connectivity at home, says a survey conducted by the authorities of the Shibpur institute.The authorities launched the survey to collect information about the students’ ability to attend online classes in the autumn semester on the basis of their experience in the previous semester.The feedback from 1,830 of the total students reveals that as many as 15.5 per cent of them could not attend online classes in the last semester and 18.3 per cent faced problems because of “poor” Internet connectivity at home, said an official of the institute.The responses from a group of 1,200 students showed that 13.2 per cent of them could not download lectures from the institute’s website and 29.8 per cent could download only partially. Apart from poor connectivity, a section of the 1,200 students cited lack of a smart device as a reason for not being able to download lectures.A group of 917 students responded to the query “How do you rate your experience of online teaching?”. An official said 10.1 per cent of the students rated online teaching as “poor”.The institute has been following a combination of live online classes and letting students download recorded lectures and study materials from the institute’s website in the autumn semester, which started on August 24. This model is being followed as classes cannot be held on the campus because of the Covid-19 pandemic.As students of the institute come from a wide spectrum of geographical locations across the country and Net connectivity is not always up to the desired level, the institute felt the need to carry out the survey.“As students had vacated the hostels in mid-March, before the start of the lockdown, some of the classes in the previous semester were held online. The students last month were asked to fill in Google forms to share their experience of attending classes online,” he said.IIEST director Parthasarathi Chakrabarty said the institute was speaking to teachers to chalk out what remedial measures could be taken. “We could buy the poor students devices such as tablets. As long as the institute will continue to hold online classes, the students will not have to pay Rs 17,500 as mess advance, Rs 3,000 as mess entrance fee, Rs 1,000 as seat rent and Rs 800 as electricity and water charges. They can buy a high-speed data pack with the saved amount,” said Chakrabarty.The institute is also trying to contact telecom service providers to help out students who are struggling with poor connectivity at home, said an official.",2020-07-09 03:45:00
1016,Our Special Correspondent,Murder arrests from within family - Telegraph India,"Two family members of the 30-year-old man who was found dead in his room earlier last week in Topsia have been arrested in connection with the murder. The two accused are the victim’s uncle Chandan Rajak, 49, and sister-in-law Priyanka Rajak, 29.Police said the two had different motives for the murder.On Tuesday morning, Abhijit Rajak, 30, who worked in a hotel, was found murdered in his home on Gobra Goroshthan Road, where he lived in a joint family. He was found dead on his bed with injury marks on his head. A blood-stained shovel was found in the room.Investigators said it was apparent that the family members who were home when the youth was murdered were aware of the crime but had initially kept quiet.“Findings of our investigations suggest that more than one family member was involved in the crime. We came to know during a prolonged interrogation that the victim’s uncle, Chandan Rajak, had a property dispute with the victim’s father. Later, Chandan admitted that he wanted to eliminate Abhijit because the youth would have inherited their ancestral property had he been alive. Chandan wanted the entire property for himself,” said an officer of Topsia police station.“Priyanka, wife of Abhijit’s cousin Somnath, has also confessed to the crime. Priyanka alleged that Abhijit used to give indecent proposals to her and other women members of the family. The allegations are yet to be verified.”The police said that after committing the crime, Chandan threw two cycles of the family into an adjoining water body to make it look like a “murder for gain”. The cycles were recovered on Friday.Chandan and Priyanka have been booked for murder, voluntarily causing hurt for robbery and common intention.",2020-07-09 03:49:00
1017,PTI,Noted dancer-choreographer Amala Shankar passes away in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Eminent dancer and choreographer Amala Shankar died in Calcutta on Friday morning at the age of 101, her family said.

Shankar, who had been suffering from age-related ailments, died of cardiac arrest in her sleep, according to her family.

1018,Anasuya Basu,Cyclone Amphan: Giant grandpa back on feet - Telegraph India,"The “wish tree” is back on its feet in the Indian Botanic Garden.The over 100-year-old Baobab tree, also known as Kalpavriksha, that was uprooted by Cyclone Amphan on May 20 was replanted at the Shibpur garden by the Hooghly on Tuesday at a second attempt.The tree weighing around 30 tonnes could not be lifted by any ordinary crane and had been lying in the garden alive, greenshoots growing from its branches.It took the garden authorities two months and requests to various authorities to bring a crane that could pull such a huge tree up. The tree was finally back on its feet following help from the Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation (KMRC) and the Central Public Works Department.The Baobab tree, a native of Africa, is known to be sturdy. It lives for 500 years and the one at the Shibpur garden is more than 100 years old.Visitors, including a Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, have made wishes touching the tree. Lore goes that wishes made under the tree come true.The 30-tonne tree had to be pruned down. On Tuesday, minus branches and leaves, the Baobab tree weighed just 15 tonnes.A telescopic hydraulic crane of the KMRC hauled it up. Its roots were treated with fungicide and the tree was replanted.The Baobab tree was introduced in India by Mughal traders about 500 years ago in the Allahabad-Muzaffarnagar region. It is known for its medicinal properties, its bark is the source of amino acids and minerals and is often used as mineral supplements.“It is one of the oldest trees in the garden,” said A.A. Mao, the director of the Botanical Survey of India (BSI). “We had tried to replant this tree with two 10-tonne cranes and one 15-tonne crane but it could not be lifted. We approached KMRC. They had the 40-tonne hydraulic crane but its operators were on leave. So we waited for them to be back,” said Mao.Both Mao and Kanak Das, the head of the garden, are confident that the tree will live. “It’s a very hardy tree and we have seen green shoots emerging from its branches,” said Das.The crane used to replant the Baobab tree has also replanted around 22 trees around Laldighi. Debasish Ghosh Dastidar of Afcons Infrastructure Ltd, who was in charge of operating the crane at the garden, said: “We have used this telescopic hydraulic crane to replant several trees that had to be removed because of the East-West Metro project.”",2020-07-29 05:31:00
1019,PTI,Coronavirus in West Bengal: 'Guru Dakshina' in times of lockdown - Telegraph India,"As the coronavirus-triggered lockdown is under way, a humble Maruti 800 car chugs along the warren of forlorn streets of South Kolkata with a sticker pasted on its windshield--'Emergency Medicine Supply'.It is not a typical medicine supply vehicle but a private car belonging to Anupam Sen, an alumnus of a city school who, along with some other schoolmates, is busy delivering medicines and grocery to their former teachers, some in their late 70s and 80s.For their first phase of delivery, the 40-member ex- students' group of South Point School -- 'Pointers Who Care' -- had a list of 15 former teachers, which included 89-year- old Dipali Sinha Roy, a widow living alone near Charu Market whose both daughters are settled in Europe.'I was running out of medicines, and to my surprise, I got a call from them on March 24. They took the list of my monthly requirement of medicines and groceries,' Roy, who taught Bengali language at the school, told PTI. She is hypertensive and suffers from heart ailment.'On March 28 morning, they came and delivered everything. At a time when my children are far away and cannot come to me in such a crisis, they are my saviours,' says Roy, her weak voice overflowing with gratitude.Roy said they not only deliver medicines but take her to doctors, and are just a call away.For former English teacher Anindita Sen of Jodhpur Park and her husband the lockdown brought worries galore.Anindita has high sugar levels and blood pressure, and her husband suffers from Parkinson's disease. They cannot survive without their daily doze of medicine.'Usually, the local medical shop delivers medicines to our home. But this time they even stopped taking our phone calls. My former students came to our rescue,' she said.'Shotti gurudakshina. Anek ashirvad korlam. Paramatma tomader mangol korun (It's an act of Guru Dakshina, God bless them),' says Keka Mukherjee, the daughter of Praneeta Banerjee, another former teacher at the school.As pestilence rampaged through many countries, the 'Pointers Who Care' anticipated trouble at home, and when it finally came, they hit the ground running.The group, the brainchild of Nivedita Roy Burman, another alumna of the school who now teaches Geography at Shri Shikshayatan College, was formed 13 years ago initially to lend emotional support to their retired teachers living a lonely life away from their children, many of whom had settled abroad.Starting off with a handful of former schoolmates, the group, which got registered under the Societies Act in 2009, now has 40 volunteers taking care of 228 former teachers.They have divided the teachers by their localities and each volunteer is in-charge of 8-10 of them.So, when the coronavirus struck, the members with a robust network of doctors and pharmacists got active on their WhatsApp group.'Life-saving medicines and groceries were the priority. We divided our work. Some volunteers were only engaged in calling up the teachers and taking the list. Others consolidated the list and procured the items.'I was in charge of delivery with Rajib Sarkar and Nivedita Roy Burman,' the Pointer's group secretary Anupam Sarkar said, explaining their modus operandi.After the formation of the group in 2007, they got in touch with other alumni, many of whom are well-settled doctors in and around Kolkata, and built up a strong network.'We found that we have specialists in almost all departments. And they were also happy to get in touch with their ex-teachers and happy to offer free treatment in an act of paying back.'In 2014, their former teacher Prithwish Kar had a medical emergency and needed hospitalisation for six weeks.The group came to his rescue, pooling in Rs 8 lakh from school alumni.'His medical bill was settled and what was left was enough to take care of his daily medicine requirements,' Sen said, wistfully remembering his former teacher, who died in 2017.The group meets twice a year with their former teachers and inquires about their health and well-being.Now, this benevolence is not limited to the former teachers of South Point School.These good samaritans are lending a helping hand to others in need.They recently reached out to a wheelchair-bound relative of a Michigan University professor in distress.'Dr Mausumi Banerjee, who is a professor of biostatistics, got to know about our initiative through Facebook and requested for help for her wheelchair-bound relative. We were there at their doorsteps,' said Sen.He and four other volunteers of the organisation were honoured by the West Bengal government.Growing every day, the group hopes their volunteer base will become stronger in the coming days.'We don't have many volunteers in north Kolkata and hopefully we will get some dedicated people who are touched by the initiative,' Sen added, before bidding a goodbye and rushing to one of the former teachers in his autumn years with a bagful of supplies.",2020-08-04 09:43:00

I've been to Africa, Turkey, and India was the first of the Asian countries I was going to travel to.'After India, I had several other countries that had to be cut short because of obviously the coronavirus. I knew the best place for me would be back at the hospital,' Mukherjee told Fox News.UK is one of the countries that have been worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China and has claimed the lives of over 80,000 people worldwide.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and he was recently taken to intensive care after his condition worsened. He is said to be stable and in good spirits .Talking to CNN, Mukherjee said she made the decision to go back after she saw the news about her country reeling from the health crisis.She received many messages from former colleagues at her old hospital, the Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, eastern England, narrating how hard the situation was for them.Mukherjee said it felt wrong to her to keep wearing the crown while her countrymen were dying due to the pandemic.When you are doing all this humanitarian work abroad, you're still expected to put the crown on, get ready... look pretty. I wanted to come back home. I wanted to come and go straight to work.'I felt a sense of this is what I'd got this degree for and what better time to be part of this particular sector than now. It was incredible the way the whole world was celebrating all key workers, and I wanted to be one of those, and I knew I could help, she said.Post her arrival in the UK, the Miss England is now self quarantining for one or two weeks.",2020-08-04 10:23:00
1023,A Staff Reporter,Coronavirus outbreak: Woman and kids flee isolation centre in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A woman escaped from a quarantine facility in New Town, along with her two children, late on Tuesday, police said.A search was launched and a police team accompanied by health department officials tracked the three down to their home in Narkeldanga on Wednesday morning, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.The three had come in contact with at least six other people in their neighbourhood. All of them were quarantined at the New Town centre on Wednesday, the officer said. Narkeldanga is around 17km from the NBCC Square in New Town where the quarantine centre has been set up for coronavirus patients, the officer said. “As this is an apartment complex, it has several gates and the woman sneaked out unnoticed through the rear gate with her children.”As soon as police got to know that the woman and her children had gone missing,  the commissionerate alerted all police stations and got in touch with Narkeldanga police station, the officer said. The woman’s phone was put under surveillance. “We began tracking her phone and traced her to her home in Narkeldanga.”The police will speak to her to find out how she travelled close to 17km at night when transport is next to impossible because of the lockdown, the officer said. The police and the health department are trying to find out if the woman was in contact with more people other than those already identified in her neighbourhood.The quarantine centre on the campus of NBCC Ltd has 200 beds, a state health department official said.

1024,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: All cleared at NRS Medical College and Hospital  - Telegraph India,"All 74 healthcare providers of the NRS Medical College and Hospital who were quarantined over the weekend for being exposed to a coronavirus patient have tested negative for Covid-19.They will undergo a second round of tests soon before they are discharged from quarantine, a hospital official said.“If the second round of tests is also negative, the healthcare providers will be in a position to return to work. The final decision will be taken by doctors. It also depends on the discretion of the doctor whether they can join work,” said a health department official.Health officials had earlier said that 79 doctors and other healthcare providers of the state-run hospital had been quarantined and their samples sent for Covid-19 tests. But an official said on Wednesday that 74 people, 39 of them doctors, had been quarantined.The Telegraph had reported in Wednesday’s edition that the test reports of 30 of those quarantined were negative. The reports of the rest of the tests arrived late on Tuesday and all were negative.While some of the healthcare providers — doctors, nurses, cleaners and other personnel — have been quarantined at a hotel in New Town, some others have been quarantined in their homes. The patient, a man in his 30s, died at the hospital on Saturday after being admitted to the male general ward with a blood disorder three to four days before. He had not shown any symptoms of coronavirus infection, an official said. No extra precautions had, therefore, been taken while treating him. The patient was shifted to the critical care unit when his condition worsened.By then he had started showing symptoms of Covid-19 and his swab sample was sent for a test. “He tested positive but the report came after his death. All healthcare providers who had been exposed to him were quarantined,” the official said.The healthcare providers were tested on Monday and Tuesday, more than four days after they had likely been exposed to the patient.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Monday urged people with Covid-19 symptoms to visit only hospitals designated for coronavirus patients. The call came after the medical service providers at NRS were quarantined.",2020-08-04 20:06:00
1026,Our Special Correspondent,Conditional bail for Arsalan scion - Telegraph India,"Arsalan scion Raghib Parwez — the prime accused in the Jaguar crash that killed two Bangladeshis on Shakespeare Sarani last year — was granted conditional bail for two months on Wednesday.The high court, which issued the bail, also ordered that Raghib be kept at the Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, where he is undergoing treatment, till the authorities decide he is fit for treatment as an outdoor patient.Police sources said the court observed that if Raghib was declared fit, he would be sent home. He, however, cannot leave home without the consent of the officer-in-charge of the local police station.Raghib’s family had moved his bail petition after the government decided to release over 3,000 convicts and undertrials from various jails to decongest the premises to contain the spread of the coronavirus.Raghib was allegedly at the wheel of a Jaguar F-PACE on the night of August 16 when it crashed into a Mercedes E-Class 220d, which in turn had hit two Bangladeshis, killing them on the spot.",2020-08-04 20:06:00
1028,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Can’t split hairs now but some are tearing their hair out  - Telegraph India," Grey streaks have suddenly appeared on dark heads. Some have parted away with the beloved moustache. Rough edges are visible on manicured nails.With salons and parlours shut for a fortnight, personal grooming has taken a backseat. Worst affected are people who consider personal grooming to be a part of personal hygiene.“Apna shakal aine mei nahi pehechaan rahe hain (Cannot recognise my own face in the mirror),” is a refrain that Arshad Ali, who runs Arshad Salon on Park Street, has heard several times from his patrons over the past few days.His shop has been shut since March 21, a couple of days before chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced a shutdown in Calcutta and three days before Narendra Modi announced a nation-wide shutdown.Ali is worried about the footfall even after the curbs are lifted. “Physical contact is often unavoidable in our profession. People will think twice before visiting salons and parlours,” he said.A Ballygunge resident who works with a global consultancy is taunted by friends for being a “salon freak”.She got a call from the parlour she goes to on March 20. “They had sensed that some curbs were imminent and told me that the place could shut down indefinitely. I went there that very day and got some basic stuff like pedicure, manicure and waxing done,” said the woman, in her 30s.“But the saving grace is that I am not having to meet anyone outside, or go to office or attend social gatherings,” she said.A 30-year-old woman in New Alipore, who co-owns an event management company, used to visit a parlour once a month for a “complete head-to-toe treatment” and once every 10-12 days for eyebrow, upper lips and similar things.“I am trying basic cleansing and scrubbing at home. There is no other option,” she said.A man in his late forties, who works for a private firm in central Calcutta, got rid of his prized moustache a couple of days ago. “I have to get my moustache trimmed once every 10-12 days because it grows very fast. I cannot do it at home. I thought it would be better to part with the moustache than keep an untrimmed one,” he said.His Facebook post, uploading pictures of himself without facial hair, has generated a fair amount of online traction.A 42-year-old homemaker from Salt Lake needs a hair spa at frequent intervals. Unable to do that at home, she has been trying some concoctions to keep her hair smooth but to little effect.Priscilla Corner, co-owner of the June Tomkyns chain of salons, said people did not visit salons only to look good. “They develop a bond with stylists. Often, they tell the stylists stuff that they will not tell their counsellors. It is not only about physical well-being but for mental satisfaction as well,” she told Metro.Asked if it was possible to do basic things like facial and hair colour at home, Priscilla said that depended on “the degree of professionalism, or the lack of it, that one is likely to live with”.Not everyone is complaining though. A 50-year-old man who lives in an apartment off EM Bypass in Patuli has been growing a beard for the first time in his life. “It is different and fun. My mother tells me it looks good,” grinned the man, a bachelor who works in a senior position with a private insurance company.Ruvena Sanyal, a city-based psychologist, said there were “graver issues at play than personal grooming”.“We are in the midst of very trying times, and each individual is reacting to stress, anxiety and fear in different ways. However, I believe we need to focus on things that really matter at this moment. There are medical personnel who need protective gear, people battling the disease and are afraid of losing their lives, thousands who have already lost their livelihoods, or are afraid of doing so, and many more who are faced with hunger,” she said.“In such circumstances, I am sure we can make compromise with the inability to follow personal grooming rituals or the inability to follow one’s regular routine,” she added.",2020-08-04 20:07:00
1029,Sudip Chatterjee,Coronavirus outbreak: Common sense is what we all need now - Telegraph India,"Viruses are neither  new nor novel. They were present on the planet well before we humans arrived. So why is Covid-19 so terrifying ?  For one, it is highly infectious. It spreads by droplets and can be viable on surfaces for two to three hours. Second, a completely healthy person can harbour the virus for up to a week before showing symptoms and spreading it to others without knowing about it. So a contact will, in a  predictable cascade, proceed to spread it to many more people.Over the years we have got used to viruses lurking in keyboards. We know they are mildly disruptive and easily ‘kill able’ by software. At worst we have to wait for a new patch to be conjured up in cyber space and ‘Poof!’ the virus disappears forever.  The real world is distinctly more unpleasant; Covid-19 does not come with a neat anti-virus kit. For many people used to a hyper certain world, this is highly distressing! Uncertainty, combined with a lack of any purposeful activity, is sure to affect most people.The best guess of experts is that 80% of those affected by Covid-19 will get mild disease and 15 % moderate disease. About 5% will get severe disease and 2 % will die.  This is about the same mortality rate as dengue. While on the subject of dengue, it’s worth noting that dengue has been doing the rounds in India for the last 30 years. We still do not have a definite treatment and a vaccine has only just been successfully tested last year. Another subtle but undeniable point is the class issue. The disease came to India through overseas travellers. Which meant it first went for the fairly well-off urbanite before heading for the slums. This does make us distinctly  uncomfortable. Prevention strategies  are pretty well known by now but hard to  foolproof in practice. Regular handwashing is OK in a condominium but impossible in an overspilling slum with limited water supply. Ditto for social distancing. We all have to leave our homes for some time,  to shop for food or medicines, lockdown or no lockdown. It is impossible to be totally and surgically secluded but it is important to be reasonable.Our bodies have a pretty robust  immune system that pushes back the moment it detects an invader. The immune response is usually quite successful in getting rid of the virus or bacterium or whatever. Sometimes the body quietly allows the virus to stay inside provided it behaves itself. An example is the chickenpox virus, which stays in the body after an attack but can rear up many years later as herpes zoster (or shingles). Sometimes the immune system goes into overkill and mounts a massive response, unleashing a vast number of toxic molecules and killer cells. This phenomenon has recently got a name and is called a cytokine storm. It is the cytokine storm that kills in Covid-19 as it killed  a 100 years ago during the Spanish flu.Chloroquine and its less toxic version, hydroxychloroquine,  may work by preventing virus entry into cells and by damping down the cytokine storm.  There are several theoretical reasons for this to happen. But actual evidence is pretty thin. In France, investigators treated 26 patients with chloroquine and compared them with 16 patients who had standard care minus chloroquine. Of the treated patients, one cleared the virus but died, three went to intensive care, one stopped taking the drug and one patient went away from the hospital. Of the 20 treated patients that were left, 14 cleared the virus from their throat in 6 days. Of the 16 patients that got standard care, two cleared the virus. A Chinese study on a larger number of patients showed benefit and is awaiting publication.The WHO is leading an international treatment effort called Solidarity, of which India is a part, which will compare five different types of treatment: ⚫ standard care⚫ standard care plus remdesivir⚫ standard care plus lopinavir and ritonavir⚫ standard care plus lopinavir, ritonavir and interferon beta⚫ standard care plus hydroxy-chloroquineAll these are drugs which have been used earlier for other reasons and are being repurposed for Covid 19. The French research institute INSERM is doing a similar study in Europe called Discovery.  Results of these studies will hopefully be available in three months’ time. Meanwhile the ICMR had made the suggestion that hydroxychloroquine be used in healthy individuals who have come into contact with Covid-19 patients, but has now dropped it from its web site.  ICMR has made no recommendation regarding treatment. The West Bengal department of health has suggested in its web site treatment with hydroxychloroquine and ritonavir. Vaccine ‘cures’ are popping up all over the globe. So are treatments. The most recent is an old drug called ivermectin, long used to treat scabies. It has been reported that it kills Covid-19 (yes, in a Petri dish) just as it kills dengue (yes, in mosquitoes).  Can we see what’s there at the end of the tunnel? There is a world-wide shortage of test kits. Given our relatively low rates of infection, no manufacturer is going to make a beeline for India, so tests will be hard to come by. The gene-based test is very accurate but requires that the laboratory has a ‘hood’ or testing chamber already in place. This is rare outside of a research setting in India. There are simpler blood-based tests where we can eliminate the possibility of Covid-19 in a person, but not make a positive diagnosis. Hopefully these will soon be widely available, but we don’t know when. We can assume that at present India is identifying its most severely affected patients but is missing out many mild or moderately ill patients. India’s death rate hovers around 2%. Had we tested more vigorously and collected as many patients as South Korea did, our death rate in percentage terms would surely be lower. This suggests that either our Covid-19 is less virulent or, more likely, our immune response is more nuanced. Anyway, both are good things to have.In West Bengal there is a discrepancy in disease rates between the Government of India’s website and what is heard on television.  This adds to our confusion.In another two months’ time, we could expect a low level of infection simmering in the community with high levels of immunity to the virus, overall, while life will limp back to the new normal.  We will probably never get to know the number of mild cases we have. Life will go on, things will slowly fall in place. Scientifically valid answers will come trickling in. We will surely get a better handle on this virus.What about doctors and paramedics on the front line? Can they refuse to treat patients? This is not an easy question to answer. Let’s ask another question: How about sending a soldier to battle without a helmet? In the absence of reasonable protective equipment, can a Corona warrior be sent to battle? It’s a hard one but we live in difficult times and will have to face difficult questions. When I was in school, my grandmother used to take me to meet a venerable sadhu, called Bharat Maharaj in Belur Math. He would always give me a sweet and tell me whatever happens, don’t ever lose your common sense. I remember him today because that’s what we all need now though in the heat of battle (again the war terminology), it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture. To put things in perspective, I’ll end with a quote from Rudyard Kipling: “If you can keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs..../ Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,/ And -- which is more --you’ll be a Man, my son!”.",2020-08-04 20:07:00
1030,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Headmaster from North 24-Parganas helps with ration - Telegraph India,"The headmaster of a school in North 24-Parganas, along with some ex-students, has helped provide ration to more than 150 families in nearby villages.The initiative started by the headmaster of Kanaknagar S.D. Institution in the Sandelerbill panchayat area has targeted 21 villages — 18 in Sandelerbill and the rest in the Hingalganj panchayat area. The beneficiaries are senior citizens living alone or families of migrant labourers stuck in other states. One such family of five, where both the parents are confined to bed and one of the daughters is mentally ill, survives on what little two daughters earn from tailoring work. With no orders coming, all they were left with was Rs 1,500.“The idea is to reach out to families within a 5km radius of the school. Till now we have identified 157 such families,” headmaster Pulak Roy Chowdhury said. Roy Chowdhury sought the help of ex-students who live in the area to identify families in need and distribute 2kg potatoes, 1kg onion, 2kg daal, 1 litre oil, 1kg soybeans and biscuits to each family. “They are getting rice and wheat from ration shops but they needed other food. We contacted the local grocers to buy the essentials,” Roy Chowdhury said. The families were identified by three students, who are village resource persons and make door-to-door visits. “Their job is to collect data from homes to know if anyone has Covid-like symptoms or if anyone has travelled recently,”  Roy Chowdhury said. Five hundred masks were also distributed among health workers.",2020-08-05 00:15:00
1032,Arkamoy Datta Majumdar,Coronavirus pandemic: Monks of Kolkata's monastery donate PPE on Buddha Purnima - Telegraph India,"A group of monks from a city Buddhist monastery distributed personal protection equipment to doctors and health workers on the occasion of Buddha Purnima on Thursday.At least 100 sets of PPE were handed over to the MR Bangur Hospital authorities on behalf of the 70-year-old Tollygunge Sambodhi Buddhist Monastery.The Buddhist monks celebrated their annual mega event by helping frontline Covid fighters. The monastery has contributed Rs 25,000 to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.“These are trying times. Lord Buddha teaches us to serve mankind. Hence we decided to serve the people who, right now, are the backbone of humanity,” Arunjyoti Bhikkhu, president of the monastery, said.Since PPE sets are single-use items, no number of kits is enough, a health department official said. “We can do with as many kits as possible. We are glad that the monks thought of this.”Customarily, monks go about seeking alms for a month before Buddha Purnima. The money collected, along with other donations, is spent on celebrations. This year, the monks used the money to buy PPE sets. As word spread, people of various faiths from across the state started contributing.The kits have been procured from a village near Santragachhi in Howrah where tailors, who have lost their jobs because of the lockdown, are engaged in manufacturing PPE sets.Sahir Laskar, who leads the group of tailors, owns a garment company. Now, he is into manufacturing and selling sets of PPE. “I was told about the monks’ plans by one of my contacts in Calcutta. I got in touch with them and they placed the order,” Laskar said.Every year, the monastery arranges an iftar for Muslims on Buddha Purnima. This year a maulana from Malda donated Rs 10,000 to the monastery’s fund when he got to know of the plan to distribute PPE sets. “Lord Buddha binds us all irrespective of the paths we choose,” the monastery president said.",2020-08-05 00:16:00
1034,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Tribute to coronavirus fighters with Rabindranath Tagore poems by Modern High School for Girls - Telegraph India,"Students of a city school have planned a programme with Rabindranath Tagore’s poems and songs to pay tribute to frontline Covid workers on the occasion of Tagore’s birth anniversary on Friday.Rabindra Jayanti celebrations are part of the Modern High School for Girls’ annual calendar but this time the programme will be in the form of video and image slides with the theme “Ora Kaaj Kore” (They Toil) by Tagore. The programme will be uploaded on the school’s website by Friday.“To show that their services are indispensable and to ensure a better future for them, we turn to Tagore for inspiration.... Celebrating the birth anniversary of India’s most relevant and timeless icon, we recognise the sacrifices of those who work for us, while simultaneously being aware of the position of privilege we occupy,” reads the introduction based on the poem. “With no surety of how long this crisis will continue, we must make judicious use of the time to cast aside our lenses of privilege and stand as a country united.”The programme has been divided into two parts — one is the art display where the girls have drawn images of doctors, nurses, caregivers, vendors and migrant labourers in black and white and in Sahaj Path style.The second is recitations, songs and dances researched from Tagore’s vast collection to link it to the theme.“Students have drawn inspiration from Tagore’s work and he has written so much, which is relevant in the current times. It is a tribute to those working on the frontline through Tagore’s spirit. There is also a message of hope,” director Devi Kar said.Students from Classes II-XII have been working from their homes, coordinating with each other while being guided by their teachers to put the programme together.Online platforms have helped them collaborate, choreograph and learn from their teachers, edit and also to arrange. “The children are in their homes not able to move out…. This gives them an opportunity to express themselves,” teacher Somali Mitra, the co-curricular coordinator, said.The junior school girls will recite Tagore’s poems and some of the senior girls will dance to “Nibiro ghono andhare jwoliche dhurbotara”, with which the online production will end to send across a message of hope and looking beyond.“We told them that the current times are a page in history and they have to document it,” Chitralekha De Bakshi, the political science teacher who coordinated the art portion, said.“There are many on the frontline, fighting the coronavirus so that we can stay at home. I have always participated in school productions but this is the first time we realised we can work together as a team despite being kilometers apart , disagree, and reach a consensus to put up a production,” Pratyusha Chakrabarti, a Class XII student, said.",2020-08-05 00:16:00
1036,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Online photography contest for students by La Martiniere for Boys - Telegraph India,"La Martiniere for Boys has decided to start an online photography competition for students apart from holding classes online.Students of Classes I-XII can send their entries on the topics “From my window” and “Quarantine diaries”. “Children should not feel they are missing out on co-curricular or extracurricular activities and hence we decided to take this initiative,” John Rafi, the principal, said.The school will put up a notice regarding this on its website on Friday and students will get 10 days to send their entries. Winners will receive prizes, which the school will announce later.“It is not about winning or losing; but we expect children to participate and learn and parents to help in the learning process,” Rafi said.Psychologists believe it is important for children to be occupied in other activities apart from studies.Children are unable to move out because of the lockdown; so, they get bored. “An engagement with a certain purpose will keep them more gainfully occupied,” a psychologist said.“They will look for things inside the house or outside their window with a different perspective… it will make them think beyond textbooks. Some may also discuss with their parents or even among friends,” a teacher said.",2020-08-05 00:17:00
1037,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Communication curbs for curious parents - Telegraph India,"Schools have come up with different ways to curb the enthusiasm of parents during online classes and restrict communication with them to ensure the privacy of teachers. From allowing only teachers to send messages in WhatsApp groups with parents to asking students to switch on the video to ensure parents do not log in from another device, schools are trying to tackle curious parents.In several schools teachers have had to form WhatsApp groups with parents to share meeting links and passwords before every online class. Many parents have been using the platform to communicate among themselves or send across messages to teachers, at times all day.In one school, a mother messaged a teacher,  asking her to join a parents’ group instead of forming a new one, to which the teacher politely replied: “Leave it to us Ma’am.”Teachers at another school have had to deal with parents discussing issues such as school fees in a group that includes teachers as well.La Martiniere for Boys teachers have formed groups with parents where only they can send messages and not the parents.“If there is something urgent that parents have to share they can send messages to the teacher separately. But we have disabled the option of parents writing in the group to stop parents from chatting and communicating with each other in the same group,” said John Rafi, the principal of La Martiniere for Boys. Teachers share the ID and password five minutes before the class to prevent leak.Calcutta Girls’ High School has stipulated two hours in a day when teachers will answer the queries of parents or children. At Mahadevi Birla World Academy, WhatsApp communication is restricted to school hours. Several schools like La Martiniere for Boys and Mahadevi Birla World Academy lock meeting rooms five minutes after the class begins to restrict unauthorised entry. “We close the meeting five minutes into the proceedings but if there are children who face network issues, they send a message to the teacher, who will then allow her in,” said Anjana Saha, the principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy. South Point is generating meeting accounts centrally instead of teachers doing so individually so that parents do not have access to teachers’ personal phone numbers. “All our meeting links and passwords are shared through the school app. This way we can protect the privacy of our teachers. If parents have any queries, they can write to the school,” said Krishna Damani,  trustee of South Point.Saha said parents can write emails to the school but messages in WhatsApp groups should be sent only within the stipulated school hours and not beyond. “Parents have to respect the boundaries of a classroom despite the class now having shifted to their homes,” the head of another school said.The schools are using the video option for teachers to check whether any parent is logging in from a separate device using the same log-in ID and password.“We noticed the number of participants was going up because parents were also logging in from a separate device. We had to make it mandatory for students to switch the camera on and keep the audio on mute, ' said Basanti Biswas, the principal of Calcutta Girls’ school.",2020-08-05 00:17:00

1043,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Test order to all private hospitals of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"All private hospitals in Calcutta will have to set up coronavirus testing laboratories and increase the number of isolation beds, the state government told the healthcare units at a meeting in Swasthya Bhavan on Thursday.The hospitals have been issued the twin directives because of a sudden surge in the number of people with Covid-19 symptoms turning up for treatment and asymptomatic patients admitted for other diseases testing positive for coronavirus infection, health department officials said.“Start tests in all hospitals with RT PCR technology. Ensure all dialysis patients are tested before undertaking dialysis procedures,” mentioned the minutes of the meeting, which was attended by representatives of 16 private hospitals in Calcutta.RT PCR, or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, is a technique used to test swab samples.At the meeting, the hospitals were asked to increase the number of isolation beds for Covid-19 patients and not to refuse any patient. They have been told to resume normal operations, including outpatient consultations and surgery.Health department officials said the demand for Covid-19 tests had suddenly increased as most private hospitals in Calcutta were performing the coronavirus test on patients being admitted for other ailments. “The demand for tests will go up further as more patients get admitted in the coming days,” said an official. Along with asymptomatic patients, the number of people being admitted with Covid-19 symptoms such as severe acute respiratory infection is also increasing, said private hospitals. About a week back, a hospital with around 300 beds was sending less than 10 samples for Covid-19 tests every day. “Now, we are sending 20 samples every day on an average as patients with other ailments or in need of surgeries are being admitted,” said an official of a private hospital.A large number of doctors, nurses and other health workers, too, are being tested.Peerless Hospital, which had to stop admissions and OPD consultations after 70 doctors and nurses had to be quarantined, is sending 20 samples for tests daily. “We cannot send more samples at a time because of shortage of facilities,” said an official. In Bengal, 2,570 samples were tested on Wednesday. Health officials said more than 30,000 samples had been tested so far. The state has 16 Covid-19 testing centres, 12 of which are in Calcutta. Among them are several private facilities.“More are needed,” said a health department official. Some hospitals have installed the machines for the test. “We have installed all equipment and are waiting for the approval,” said Alok Roy, the chairman of Medica Superspecialty Hospital. “We will apply for NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) inspection this week. Our technicians have been trained,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, which runs RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.Sources said an investment of Rs 40 lakh to Rs 50 lakh was needed to set up a testing facility.Additional reporting by Subhajoy Roy",2020-08-05 00:19:00
1045,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus pandemic: Test facility overburdened on School of Tropical Medicine - Telegraph India,"The School of Tropical Medicine (STM) will send some of the samples it gets for Covid-19 tests to a private laboratory, the state government has decided in an attempt to reduce the backlog at the Central Avenue facility.“The government has instructed doctors at the STM to hand over samples to representatives of the private laboratory. Representatives will come and collect the samples,” a doctor at the STM said.The STM tests samples from the entire Howrah district, Lady Dufferin Victoria Hospital in Calcutta and the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, apart from the ones it collects on its campus.A few police stations, including Bowbazar and Hare Street, send samples of their officers to the STM for tests.Over the past few days, the laboratory at the STM has been testing a little over 300 samples daily. Doctors at the institution, set up in 1914, said the rush of samples was such that microbiologists, virologists and lab technicians had been forced to work 12 hours a day.But even that isn’t enough and the backlog keeps mounting, Howrah’s share being the highest. “We received the results of 960 samples from the STM on Thursday. The samples had been sent almost five days before. It would take some time to sort out the positive and negative reports,” Bhabani Das, the chief medical officer of health of Howrah, told Metro. Doctors at the STM said that while the sample load had been rising by the day, there was no proportionate increase in the staff strength. Health department officials said efforts were on to engage technicians trained in conducting polymerase chain tests for Covid-19 from other departments to the eight coronavirus testing centres set up in medical colleges. “We have decided to even pay an incentive of Rs 5,000 to technicians who will agree to work on additional shifts. We are trying our best to arrange for more hands and speed up tests,” said a senior official of the health department.",2020-08-05 00:20:00
1046,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Lockdown: Calcutta missing from first list of flights - Telegraph India,"The Centre on Thursday started an evacuation drive to bring stranded Indians back to the country with Air India operating nearly 70 special flights from across the world and several Indian cities. Calcutta, however, is not on the list in the first phase.Several Calcuttans stuck in other countries said they were desperate to return but did not want to fly back to other cities like Mumbai and Delhi and get quarantined there for at least 14 days. There will be domestic flights connecting Indian cities, too, but Calcutta does not figure on that list either, airline officials said. Priority has been given to states with better quarantine facilities, a civil aviation ministry official said. A senior state official said cities with more stranded people were on the first list. “Individuals stuck in these countries have to register themselves with the Indian embassies there and the external affairs ministry has made a list of evacuees based on these applications. Flights have been scheduled to Indian cities with greater demand,” the Bengal official said on Thursday. “If Calcutta has enough demands from people stuck in a particular country, the external affairs ministry will designate a flight here as well.”The Centre had asked the Bengal government if there are enough quarantine facilities in the city to accommodate those who return. “We said we do. If required, we can create quarantine facilities for these passengers. That is not a problem,” the official said on Thursday night.Park Street resident Sonal Kapoor is stuck in Abu Dhabi with her visa cancelled. She had gone to Dubai in November on a six-month internship with a market research firm. “After the outbreak of Covid-19, I knew the lockdown would be in place for some time and so I informed the company that I would not continue with the internship. In keeping with the rules, I applied for cancellation of my visa on March 22 and on March 25, it was cancelled by the Dubai authorities,” Sonal said on Thursday from Abu Dhabi.But she has been stuck at a relative's place in Abu Dhabi since. “I have enrolled myself with the Indian embassy here and am awaiting their reply,” she said. “I had to mention the nearest airport in the form, which in my case  is Calcutta. I don't want to land in Mumbai and get quarantined there.”Vikram Tejwani, a Calcuttan studying biotechnology at Leeds University in the UK, was to come home for Easter. “Now, we have been told people in distress like those whose visas have expired, pregnant women and the elderly will get priority,” he said.Air India officials said nearly 70 flights were being operated between May 7 and 15, bringing nearly 20,000 people from the US, UK, UAE, Bangladesh, Singapore and other countries. They would be connecting to cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Calicut, Bangalore, Hyderabad. “The evacuation was planned and the destinations chosen by the government.

They were to join the company as senior community operations specialists, analytics. The students had been promised a compensation package of Rs 8 lakh a year and were expected to join work in Hyderabad in July, an IIEST official said. “Since the company focuses on areas such as trend analytics, pricing analytics and forecast modelling for passengers, it hired the students for the analytics wing,” the official said.The company contacted the students on Wednesday. “It said in a communication to the students that the withdrawal of the offer was a business decision. The economic downslide must have triggered the business decision,” Konika Das, a professor of the electrical engineering department who is in charge of the IIEST publicity cell, told Metro.One of the students said an official of the company had told him that the turmoil in the market because of the pandemic had led to the withdrawal of the offer. “We had suspected that the offer could be rescinded and so got in touch with the company on April 6. The company assured us that there was no threat to the jobs. But a month later, they said what we had been fearing all along,” the student said.An official of the institute’s placement cell said the authorities had in the middle of April written to all recruiters, including the ride hailing company, urging them not to withdraw their offers.  “The ride hailing companies are among the worst hit as no one is venturing out. Even if the lockdown is lifted, the normal volume of rides will not be restored easily,” said the official.The company had informed the students that if they signed the standard acknowledgment release clause, they would receive a lump sum payment equal to six weeks of pay for the role they were offered.Another official of the institute said the compensation worked out to around Rs 1 lakh. Metro reported last week that a global analytics consultancy firm had withdrawn its job offer to 12 engineering students of Jadavpur University, citing constraints because of the pandemic.",2020-08-05 00:21:00

There won't be the usual singing of Tagore songs at Jorasanko on the poet's birth anniversary on Friday. Hundreds of people gather on this day every year at the house, where Tagore was born in 1861, to hum along during a live concert.

1052,Brinda Sarkar,"Lockdown: Drone vigil on New Town markets, streets - Telegraph India","New Town is using drones to fly over its markets and streets to ensure residents abide by the lockdown rules.“We had invited companies to demonstrate drone technology and are using it to monitor the situation now,” said Debashis Sen, chairman of New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA). “We are deploying drones in two time slots — from 7am to 9am and 5pm to 7pm — as both are peak shopping hours.”Since shopping is the only activity people are allowed to do outside homes, Sen said it has been noticed that entire families are trying to use it as an excuse to venture out. “So we are letting only one member of the family into markets while others remain in the car,” he said. “The upheaval in the livelihood of daily wage earners has also forced many of them to sit outside markets and sell vegetables. The drones can help us ensure that at least social distancing norms are being adhered to.”The feed from the drones is being streamed live at an NKDA control room and upon any violation a task force is being alerted to go make relevant announcements over mics at the spot or inform the police. “NKDA has 12 markets and we are trying to ensure safety norms as far as possible. But social distancing at the informal street markets — near Shapoorji Pallonji, near Lohapool and near DLF —  is proving tough to maintain.”NKDA has citizen volunteers who keep an eye on the markets. “They alert us when rules are not followed. But the crowd is refusing to listen to  our officials too.” The authorities have now sought help from the Bidhannagar Police to manage the markets.Tech talkThe drones are being flown by Federal Synergies India, a technology company that has its office at Salt Lake’s AMP Vaisaakkhi mall. “Drones are a versatile and effective tool for last-mile connectivity,” says Prayush Poddar, in charge of customer outreach of the company.The air-borne cameras can be flown by a handler on the ground — who can see the flight course on a tab attached to the remote control in his hands — or automatically if the authority informs them beforehand of the specific area to be surveyed. “Sometimes we have noticed crowds at markets, children playing football or cricket or residents heading out for evening walks. The information goes straight to NKDA with GPS co-ordinates.The drones have anti-collision sensors and there are 14 pre-flight checks and balances that have to be ensured before the drones are air-borne. Having registered with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, they have to follow several guidelines.Poddar, who himself is a drone pilot certified by Federal Aviation Administration of the US, says technology is even available to home deliver lunch to residents during the lockdown. “But the economics has to be looked into,” says Poddar, a resident of GD Block.Sen is open to ideas. “Companies have been approaching us with offers to spray sanitiser from drones or do micing but they will have to demonstrate these features before we take a call. There has to be substantial value addition. It makes no sense to use a drone to do something a car can.”Additional reporting by Sudeshna Banerjee",2020-08-05 08:11:00
1053,Sudeshna Banerjee,Residents come together to organise a series of blood donation camps  - Telegraph India,"With blood banks drying up during the pandemic, residents of New Town have come together to organise a series of blood donation camps in the residential complexes and blocks across the township.With blood banks drying up during the pandemic, residents of New Town have come together to organise a series of blood donation camps in the residential complexes and blocks across the township.The first of these took place at Greenwood Elements in Action Area IID last Saturday.The proposal was mooted by members of two voluntary groups —Cenergy and New Town Forum and News (NTFN) — which have also provided food packets to the impoverished in association with the housing complexes. “We had gone to hand over dry rations to the Eco Park police station for distribution among the needy when I was given a proposal by Alaktika resident Arindam Dutta Chowdhury of Cenergy, asking if our complex could organise a camp. It took us 15 minutes to say yes,” said Arnab Bhowmik, secretary of Greenwood Elements Apartment Owners’ Association.“When we approached North 24-Parganas District Hospital and Blood Bank in Barasat for permission we were told ours would be one of the first civilian camp to be held in North 24-Parganas after the lockdown,” smiled Samaresh Das of NTFN. There would be quite a few restrictions though, the topmost being a cap on the number of donors to avoid a large gathering.“We take bookings for camps three months in advance. When the lockdown was announced, we were directed to cancel all the civilian bookings and attend only the camps organised by the police. It is only in the last week of April that we were granted permission to hold civilian camps as well in view of the rising scarcity of blood. But there could be no more than 30 donors,” said Sumitra Halder, camp-in-charge who came from the blood bank.Bhowmik said initially they were worried about getting 30 donors. “Till yesterday morning, we had only 12 volunteers. The first lady who had registered, Khusboo Bihani, was turned down as her haemoglobin count was lower than required. But even then we reached the required number, including six spot registrations,” he added.A total of 32 people gave blood including four members of the Mishra family. “I am a regular blood donor. When I saw all the precautions being taken, I felt confident about giving blood,” said Akash Mishra. His wife and two sons also donated blood.The camp was held maintaining the health department’s Covid-19 protocol, with the ones collecting blood in personal protective equipment and every donor’s temperature being checked with a thermal gun. “The directive has also specified that everyone maintain social distance, wash hands, wear masks and use sanitisers,” Halder added.“They took all the precautions. This is a great endeavour by residents. We have to remember that coronavirus will not make other diseases go away. So blood will still be needed,” said Hidco chief Debashis Sen, who was invited to attend the camp.Next weekend, camps have been planned at Mallika Malancha and CE Block. “We hope to hold 25 such camps,” said Das.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-08-05 08:11:00
1054,Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus lockdown: To call or not to call for help  - Telegraph India,"To call or not to call the domestic help: that is the question. The lockdown is well into the second month and by now residents are exhausted at having to cook and clean all by themselves.From May 4, the government has allowed domestic help in even the red zones but The Telegraph finds that many residents are still in two minds.Strong resolveNandita Ghosh of FE Block is an insulin-dependant diabetic. The pensioner has had two spine surgeries and a knee replacement, because of which she cannot stand for long. “My fingers are paining from scrubbing the kadai and chatu clean,” she gasps, but adds in the same breath: “I will still not let any domestic help into the house. Not till Covid-19 is under control.”It’s the same in DB Block, where Sonali Basak is unable to maintain her huge bungalow by herself. “I am cleaning only part of the house, where I’m staying most of the time,” says the lady, who stays alone. “But I can’t take a chance by letting in the domestic help. I am telling neighbours to refrain too but many of them are not listening. We have to be extra cautious as we have had Covid-positive cases in our very block.”AA Block’s Urmy Palchaudhuri sent her two helping hands on leave even before the lockdown and asked them to cite her example at other houses where they work to seek leave from there as well. Her family members are now washing their own dishes and trudging along.Ashima Dutta Roy is slogging from 6.30am every day and sitting to have lunch at 4pm. “There’s just too much work,” says the FD Block lady whose family has three pets and also feeds the street dogs outside. “But better safe than sorry. Domestic helps are, as it is, low on hygiene. Even on the eve of the lockdown when I asked my help to wash her hands before and after chopping vegetables, she grumbled that it’s a bother! And I could never get her to wear a mask.”Dutta Roy’s help lives in Duttabad, where a Covid-19 case has already been detected.Those who blinkedAt some homes, domestic workers were never discontinued. These are usually homes of the elderly who depend on help living in garages nearby.One such resident hails from BC Block. The elderly man who lives alone had been living on bread and instant noodles for the first few days of the lockdown. But a friend told him of a cook who lives across the street and the man now calls her over to cook twice a week.“My neighbours have been objecting to the lady’s entry but when I asked them for an alternative they had none. Of course I’m scared of Covid but if I live on Maggi is my immunity not reducing even more? When people go to markets are they not undertaking a minimum risk for the sake of sustenance? I am doing the same,” he reasons.The Saha family of GD Block has compromised after a month. “We in GD Block are surrounded by Covid cases in GC, HA, EE blocks… Plus the real risk of spread begins now after the May 4 exemptions.But I cannot slog anymore; my shoulders are paining,” says Sangeeta Saha. “I’ve now left it to fate and asked my cleaning lady to start coming every three or four days.”DA Block resident Saswati Nandi has a care-giver come every morning to look after her ailing husband. “She walks from Muchibazar. I could not have managed any chores if this lady wasn’t there to look after my husband. As for my cleaning lady, she comes once in a while when she goes to the market. Otherwise her neighbours don’t let her leave their locality.”Champa Majhi (name changed) is a domestic help who lives in Kestopur and has started coming to a BE Block house from about two weeks back. “An elderly lady lives alone in that house and she can barely walk, let alone cook for herself. The other houses I work at have asked me not to come but this lady is helpless,” says Champa.The help had tried coming a few times early in the lockdown but claims the cops chased her away from the footbridge. “So now I come at dawn before the police take charge,” she says.End of tetherAt the beginning of the lockdown Debi Kesh bravely asked her helps to stay away but after all these weeks her strength has drained. “I can pull it off for, at most, another month. Beyond that even if I am threatened of catching Covid, I won’t be able to do chores,” says the senior citizen of FE Block.“Today my help tried to come to work but her neighbours didn’t let her. I spoke to her neighbours over phone, citing the government relaxation, but they refused,” Kesh says.Mahasweta Sil of AB Block said her cleaning lady called on Monday to ask if she should resume work. “But since my neighbours haven’t started availing of help yet, I asked her to lie low for a few more days,” she said.Of course, the helps are undergoing great financial problems. “In one neighbour’s house, their help forced her way in and started sweeping the floor. She said her family had nothing to eat and that the household ought to let her work and earn a living again,” says Sil sadly.At CK Block, a resident says she cannot go out to the balcony without someone calling out from the street and asking if they needed someone for chores. Despite the hardship, some residents are scared of employing these freelance workers.“Who knows where they are coming from and how many homes they have worked in before? They may spread infection. We have elderly residents at home and cannot take that chance,” says Raka Chaudhuri of AD Block.One of Chaudhuri’s helps comes by train from Khardah and with train services suspended, she need not mull over whether or not to allow the help to come. Her other help lives in Kestopur but is unable to come. “I am managing for now but don’t know how long we can keep going like this.”Complex calculationFaced with mounting pressure from residents, Uniworld City is contemplating a system whereby domestic help can be allowed in a phased manner. “There are about 970 part-time household staffers in our complex, each with her identity card number. We plan to divide the number by three. Those with numbers that are multiples of three, get to come one day. Those that are not multiples of three and are odd numbers get to come the next day. Those that are not multiples of three and are even numbers come on the third day. The cycle gets repeated after this. But no decision has been taken as voices are strong on both sides. We are still collecting data on how many residents need their domestic help to come,” said Pradipta Dutta, a member of the Kolkata Uniworld City Apartment Owners’ Association board.Some housing societies have had residents driving out in their cars and coming back with the cook or domestic help in the backseat, despite their entry being banned by the committee.The debate over resumption of their service is doing the rounds of residents’ social media groups, with people asking for suggestions, sometimes resulting in heated debates. Some argued for their return claiming that with workplaces reopening, albeit with reduced staff, an office-goer in the family would have as much chance of picking up the infection and becoming an asymptomatic carrier as the cook or the help coming in. Others defended the re-entry claiming their help did not work at any other house but was faced with the counterpoint that the person would still be exposed to common areas in the complex and could pick up an infection from there. Another emerging voice was for resumption of life, claiming one would have to learn to live with the virus.There’s also the question of payment. While all residents spoken to said they had paid the helps’ first month’s salaries in full, thereafter many would be paying half the sum. “I’ll pay them in full till May,” says Anindita Saha of CE Block. “Let’s give our helps a break for a few months. We can all make small sacrifices. And besides, compared to their problems, we have no right to complain.”Whatever the fate of domestic helps, drivers living close by are still being asked to report for work. But with nowhere to go to, the drivers are being reduced to delivery boys, doing the shopping for the family.Additional reporting by Sudeshna Banerjee",2020-08-05 08:11:00
1058,Sudeshna Banerjee,Taking precautions against dengue ahead of monsoon - Telegraph India,"The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is taking precautions against dengue ahead of monsoon. “Just because Covid-19 is taking its toll does not mean dengue will spare us,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen.Fumigation has been done in several places. “Another method is working even better. We are identifying breeding spots of larvae and spraying larvaecide there. We deployed a boat in Kestopur Canal, which flows to the east of New Town by Sanjeeva Town, to eliminate larvae hotspots in the water with BTI (Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis, a group of bacteria used as biological control agents for larvae). We did it intensively over a week. The canal is rather dirty, because of sewerage discharge and stagnant, which is ideal for mosquito breeding.” BTI is also being sprayed in under-construction buildings and wherever else stagnant water is being found.NKDA has set up a volunteer group to monitor the mosquito situation. “They talk to residents in their respective areas to check if the mosquito menace has reduced. Till last winter, we could not hold programmes at Eco Park without burning mosquito repellent coils,” Sen said.A video conference was held with the volunteers last Saturday to seek feedback on whether the situation had improved after the vector control drive. ",2020-08-05 08:41:00
1060,Snehal Sengupta,"Lockdown: Covid cases found in Mizoram House, CAP camp - Telegraph India","Four more cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Salt Lake over the past week and one of them, a 74-year-old cancer patient from Mizoram, has died.The patients having tested positive recently are one each from Duttabad and Calcutta Armed Police (CAP) camp quarters, next to AE Block, and two from IB Block’s Mizoram House. This includes the patient who died.The 74-year-old resident of Aizawl had come to Calcutta in March for treatment of cancer. He was admitted to a Salt Lake hospital on April 10 and discharged a few days later. But he was admitted once again on April 30. At around the same time, a 55-year-old man, also staying at Mizoram House, was admitted to the same hospital. Both tested positive for Covid-19 and the elderly man died on Sunday.Police and civic officials have now turned IB Block into a containment zone. They have sealed off the lane from the Amul Island till Big Bazaar.“We now have 84 guests at Mizoram House, out of whom around 19 have been sent to a government quarantine centre and the rest have been confined here itself,” said an official of Mizoram House. “We also have two houses in IB Block which are used to accommodate additional guests. The staff there have been cautioned too.”Pranay Kumar Ray, the mayoral council member in charge of the health department of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, said they would ensure the delivery of food and essentials to Mizoram House. “We have requested police to ensure nobody steps out of the building and are in constant touch with the building authorities. We will provide them all possible help,” Ray said.He also said they had sanitised all the lanes of IB Block.More containment zonesThe Covid-19 patient from Duttabad is a 32-year-old housekeeping staffer of a private hospital off EM Bypass. The man has been hospitalised and four of his family members are quarantined at a government unit. At CAP camp, a police constable has tested positive.  In all these areas, police has tightened security and is monitoring the movement of people. Including the cases of the previous weeks, the township now has more than a dozen sealed-off areas, a civic official said.In the list of containment zones released on Tuesday night, FD, GC, HA, DB blocks, Mizoram House and Duttabad have been mentioned other than Basanti Debi Colony in Chingrihata.In New Town, AL Block is the sole containment zone in Hidco-administered area. “A resident has tested positive there and has been admitted to MR Bangur Hospital. The family has been kept in isolation,” said a Hidco official. The list includes Gouranganagar Dhalai Bridge and Rekjoani in adjoining Rajarhat panchayat area as well as Chinar Park, Charnock Hospital, Haldiram and Samarpally, Kestopur among the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation-administered areas nearby.",2020-08-05 08:42:00
1062,Snehal Sengupta,"Lockdown: Baton charge, ID proof check for liquor queues - Telegraph India","So long were the queues in front of liquor shops on the first day that the government allowed them to open that police had to resort to baton charges even before the shops opened.After a long dry spell, booze shops finally opened on Monday and tipplers had started forming queues from the morning itself. The shops finally opened at 3pm but before that police resorted to mild baton charges to prevent crowding.One hub was the City Centre area around which three shops opened — Silver Sands Bar and Restaurant opposite the petrol pump, Farina Bar and Restaurant on the other side opposite the petrol pump, and on the ground floor of Hotel Aayash, opposite De Sovrani hotel.Suman Bhattacharya, a sub-inspector of the Bidhannagar North police station who was posted at the stretch covering these three shops, said they faced an uphill task ensuring social distancing. “Most of the people are standing close to each other. I had to ask several of them to either wear masks or stand well apart in the queues,” he said.    An elderly man was overheard advising youths in the queue to stand apart for good reason. “Else neither you nor I will get a bottle,” he said.From Tuesday, the shops started opening at noon and shutting at 6pm but the size of the crowds only swelled further.“The queues got so long that we had to start checking ID proofs of those in line,” said Bhattacharya. “This was to prevent outsiders.Tarit Kumar Dutta, an employee of Silver Sands, said he had never seen such long queues. “I have been manning the counter here for years and have never seen anything like this before. Most people are confused about the additional 30 per cent being charged as state tax while several are miffed that we are giving out only two bottles per person as per the directives of the government,” said Dutta.",2020-08-05 10:05:00
1063,The Telegraph,Lockdown: Posture tips for work for home - Telegraph India,"Should I get down on all fours and mop the floor?” is a common question physiotherapist Shipra Kumari has been facing from patients ever since the lockdown started and the answer is a strict “no”.With most domestic workers out of the picture, residents are having to cook and clean by themselves and Kumari, who runs Alexa Active Aging healthcare services at New Town’s Snehodiya senior citizen’s home, has been receiving many a call about the right way to perform chores.“In every other house, there is a homemaker suffering from pain in the back or legs and in some cases, this dates back to well before the lockdown. Women have been suffering for years because of wrong posture while conducting chores,” saysKumari, who lives in New Town’s BB Block.The good news is that much of the pain and many of the injuries associated with chores are avoidable. “ Low back pain, neck pain, tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis (heel pain) can all be avoided if your posture is correct,” Kumari says, sharing some tips with The Telegraph.While cleaningWhen mopping the floor: Again, do not get down on all fours. Use a mop with a vertical stick attached and keep your back and neck straight while at it. Do not stoop as the awkward position will lead to back pain.Often people’s backs start aching while sweeping or mopping but they continue just so they can get over with the chore at one go. Do not do this. If you are in pain, take rest.While washingLaundryWhen loading the washing machine: Do not bend over. This is for front-loading machines. Keep a stool in front of the machine or get down on one knee so you can comfortably put clothes in. Do not try to stuff in clothes while standing and bending over.When hanging up clothes to dry: Forget about wringing them. The repetitive wrist action can lead to injuries.At the marketWhen returning with bags full: Don’t carry everything in one hand. Divide bags equally so both your hands lift more or less the same amount of weight. When lifting heavy bags, squat slightly and bend your knees. Do not stoop over and try to lift the bags. You’ll hurt your back.Slip riskUse non-slip surfaces and anti-fatigue mats to prevent slippage and to stand comfortably.Always wear slippers at home and make sure they have some cushioning and anti-slip soles, especially under the heels. Don’t wear completely flat slippers. The “Crocs” variety are suitable.In painIf you indeed incur an injury or develop pain doing chores, apply cold pack. You can continue this for seven days as the pain is initially acute. Thereafter apply hot pack, but consult a doctor.In the kitchenWhen chopping vegetables: It is best to use automated devices available in the market. If you have these gadgets, use them to chop, peel and grind vegetables so you are spared repetitive motion of your hands. Repetitive motion for upper arms, elbows, forearms and wrists is defined as more than 10 repetitions per minute. For activities involving the shoulders it is more than 2.5 repetitions per minute. These can lead to musculoskeletal injuries.If you do not have these gadgets and have to chop veggies manually, make sure your elbow is not pressed against the table for too long. This can lead to a kind of pain called carpal tunnel syndrome.Also ensure your knives, scissors etc have adequate padding and good grip at the sharp edges lest you stress your hands.When kneading dough: Alternate yours hands. The idea is to avoid repetitive motion. So after a few times of kneading the dough with your dominant hand, switch over the to the other and return to the first again. But once again, it’s best to use dough-makers and roti makers.When washing dishes: Do not stand at the sink for hours at a stretch. Any static posture is bad for the body, where static posture is defined as body positions held without movement for more than 10 seconds.Place a footstool in front of you and keep one leg on it. After a while, change legs. This will shift body weight and reduce stress on the legs and lower back.It is also a good idea to pull up a stool and sit while at it. Else people can get plantar fasciitis, that causes heel pain.When reaching for a utensil: Don’t try to reach too high and far, especially beyond the point of comfort. Move yourself close to the utensil before pulling it to you.Try storing items on shelves between knee and shoulder-height to avoid excessive torso flexion to reach them. If the object is too high above, stand on a stool before reaching for it. Also, face the objects you are working on; do not twist and reach behind or to the sides of the body.The shelf design matters too. It is ergonomical to use sliders.When lifting a heavy container: Simply don’t. Instead of one heavy container of flour, divide the contents into three small containers that will be easier to lift. If this cannot be avoided, remember that it is easiest to lift heavy items from mid-height. Never place heavy boxes on the ground or ground-level shelves as you can injure yourself lifting them.In case of objects like gas cylinders, keep them on wheels at the bottom so you can gently pull them in and out instead of lifting dead weight.When bending over: Sit on a stool or chair instead. This is better than squatting, kneeling or hunching while working.When carrying food to the table: Do not try to carry bowls that are slippery, too hot or unevenly balanced. This will avoid accidents.When working for longStretches: Try job rotation. For instance, while washing dishes, take frequent breaks. Stretch your hands, neck, do “tadasana” by lifting your arms over your head or simply tend to some other chore before returning to the dishes.",2020-08-05 10:07:00
1064,A Staff Reporter,Actor Nigel Akkara lends hand in Ward 30 sanitisation - Telegraph India,"Ward no 30 had a celebrity visitor to kick off sanitisation in the area. Nigel Akkara, actor and entrepreneur, spearheaded a drive over two days.As he and three of his colleagues from Kolkata Facilities Management made the rounds of AH, BH, BG, CG blocks, Police Abasan, Banashree Abasan and Baisakhi Abasan, an announcer in a pilot vehicle asked residents to shut their windows and remove clothes from verandahs. “We have amid us the actor Nigel Akkara,” the announcer said. But if curious faces tried to catch a glimpse, they were urged to get back inside.“We are spraying hydrogen peroxide, silver nitrate and sodium hypochrolite mixed with water. The process is called misting. Our company used to sanitise containers. After Covid-19 broke out, we started getting requests to sanitise offices. This is the work I did when I came back to the mainstream. But once the lockdown was announced, my chemicals and machines fell idle. So I offered sanitisation as a voluntary service and approached various civic bodies. Chairperson of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Anita Mandal took up my offer,” said Nigel, wearing his long hair in a pony tail, his bearded face partially hidden behind a mask.Written with inputs from Debasmita Bhattacharya",2020-08-05 10:07:00
1065,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Lockdown: 70km cycle ride to Kolkata for work and hope   - Telegraph India,"A 57-year-old man from North 24-Parganas cycled for about 70km to his leather goods manufacturing unit in Kasba on May 5 when the company resumed operations amid the lockdown. Dilip Kumar Dutta said he wanted to get back to work after sitting at home for more than a month. Another worker at the same factory, Rehmatullah Laskar, 37, also cycled for 50km to work from his home in South 24-Parganas because he was scared he would lose his job if he didn’t report for duty.The company’s officials said they were flooded with requests from workers eager to get back to work but had to refuse many because of the government restrictions on manpower. Dilip set off from his home in Habra on his bicycle around 8am and reached the Kasba Industrial Estate at 6pm. He said the six-hour ride took much longer because he had to take several breaks on the way. North 24-Parganas being a red zone for Covid-19, no public transport was available.Before the lockdown, Dilip would cycle to Habra station, 3km from his home, and take a local train to Ultadanga or Ballygunge, from where he would take a bus or an auto to the factory in Kasba. “At my age, it is extremely difficult to ride the bicycle for almost 70km. But when I got a call from my factory manager that operations were going to resume, although on a smaller scale, I felt the urge to join work,” said Dilip, who is the superviser of the sample production unit at the factory. “If I don’t go to work, other boys in the sample production unit would become almost non-functional.”Dilip received his monthly salary of about Rs 30,000 last month though the factory was closed because of the lockdown. “But if production had remained stalled for longer, we would all be affected. So it was important to start operations,” said Dilip, who has been working at the unit since 2008.The Kasba unit opened after the relaxations announced by both the Centre and the state. On May 4, Dilip received an e-pass from his company that allowed him to travel and join work.The seat of his bicycle started giving trouble on the way. No repair shop was open but he went to a mechanic’s home and urged him to fix the seat.“I was carrying several bottles of water, a few of them containing water mixed with salt and sugar and some containing glucose water. I was wearing a cap to protect myself from the sun, besides a mask and gloves,” Dilip said. “I stopped at a sweet shop on Jessore Road and took several more breaks. I would sit under the shade of a tree and rest for half an hour or so.” His wife called him several times, worried that he could fall ill.Dilip was stopped at several police checkpoints but allowed to proceed after he showed his documents.Dilip’s team member, Rehmatullah, had started from his home at Dakshin Barasat in South 24-Parganas around 4am. He, too, had to cycle to work since local trains were not operating. He took two short breaks on the way and reached Kasba around 7am.“I was given the choice of joining now or wait for the lockdown to get over. But this is the time when samples for the coming season in Europe and other places are delivered to customers every year. This year already it’s late and I was very worried about what would happen if the orders were cancelled because of the delay in production,” said Rehmatullah, who has been working with the company for a year.“The company has paid me my salary till date but if the orders are cancelled then I may lose my job. So I was desperate to join work,” said Rehmatullah, who has his wife and four sons to support.Rehmatullah’s wife and parents asked him not to venture out amidst lockdown but he didn’t listen.Both Dilip and Rehmatullah are now staying at the manufacturing unit along with other workers.",2020-08-05 21:47:00
1067,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Cops prepare for curbs on truck entry in Burrabazar and Posta - Telegraph India,"Senior officers of Calcutta police on Friday began an exercise to examine whether trucks reaching parts of Burrabazar and Posta from outside Bengal could be terminated at a truck terminal on Kona Expressway and the goods ferried in small pick-up vans to the trading hub.Mayor Firhad Hakim had said on Thursday that movement of trucks to Burrabazar needs to be curbed to avoid spread of Covid-19 and that the police have been asked to find an alternative unloading spot for trucks.Several Burrabazar traders have told the police that most of them do not have godowns and trucks that arrive with goods usually remain parked on roads — mostly along Strand Road — for days till unloading is completed.    “We are trying to ascertain how many trucks usually reach Burrabazar every day and what is the mechanism of loading and unloading of goods from trucks,” said a senior officer of the Calcutta police’s central division. “We will also have to examine the existing capacity of the Dhulagarh truck terminal on Kona Expressway and the facilities available there.”Traders and truck operators from Posta and Burrabazar have told the police that around 1,200 trucks reach the wholesale hub every day and the number goes up to around 3,000 ahead of festive seasons, including Id and Durga Puja. This number could vary, officers said, while collecting information on movement of goods vehicles in this area.  Senior officers said if curbs were to be imposed on entry of trucks, proper scanning facilities would have to be set up with doctors and healthcare workers at the truck terminal in Dhulagarh so that drivers arriving from other states, along with their helpers, can be screened for the coronavirus. Drivers of the vehicles carrying goods from the terminal to the markets in central Calcutta would also have to be screened every day to avoid chances of spread from possible carriers. All the vehicles would have to be sanitised. “Movement of heavy vehicles cannot be restricted without creating adequate infrastructure at the truck terminal on Kona Expressway,” an officer said. “We had to stagger movement of trucks carrying fruits to Mechhua because there wasn't enough space to accommodate around 60 vehicles at the wholesale market.” Truck operators said Dhulagarh truck terminal could accommodate up to 300 trucks and if there has to be steady flow of trucks in and out of the parking lot, some basic infrastructure would be required.“For a truck terminal to be functional, there must be several godowns and facilities for allowing labourers to stay. There should be a proper eating house and a workshop for repairs,” said Subhas Chandra Bose, the general secretary of the West Bengal Truck Operators’ Association.",2020-08-05 23:02:00
1068,Chandreyee Ghose,Coronavirus Lockdown: Ration without queues for needy in East Midnapore - Telegraph India,"Nursing student Gourab Das, 25, goes around his village in East Midnapore every morning to reach out to families in distress during the lockdown.Gourab has been looking after over 100 impoverished families in his neighbourhood for over a month now. He is the local coordinator of a pan-India network that has arranged ration for around 8,000 families in eight states. It all started in Bangalore with author and entrepreneur Sudipto Das coming up with a distribution model that involves no crowding and queuing up for hours.“Where I stay there are many migrant workers from Bengal and Odisha. I wanted to help them,” Sudipto said. “I devised a plan where the local grocery shops would directly hand them a bag of ration and I would coordinate the distribution over the phone.”Sudipto identified distressed families in his neighbourhood and made an arrangement with  local stores to hand out packets containing 2kg rice, 500 grams daal, potatoes, onions, and cooking oil to them. Families of more than five got two packets a week.  “I kept in touch with the beneficiaries over the phone. They were asked to send us pictures with the ration, their ID proofs and also a picture of their families to avoid malpractice,” said Sudipto.The labourers who Sudipto helped in Bangalore led him to their distressed families and friends in villages in Bengal and other states. Sudipto’s batchmates from IIT Kharagpur, Ramakrishna Mission, Purulia, and Ramakrishna Mission, Narendrapur, pitched in. “We were able to reach out to a cluster of 1,500 tribals in Asansol, 200 ragpickers and artisans in Murshidabad and over 400 in Midnapore besides Delhi, Mumbai, Vijaywada and other places,” said IIT alumni and IT entrepreneur Sagar Chaudhury, who is from Asansol.The group, led by Sudipto, helped around 80 musicians from Calcutta, Howrah, Burdwan, Hooghly and other districts. “I personally use my network to track down musicians in distress. There are many. A friend of mine, a tabla player, was close to suicide because he did not have money to feed his son or take him to a doctor. I am trying to reach out to poor artistes, dhakis and even instrument makers who are now jobless. A whole lot of musicians would earn by offering tutions. There are no Zoom classes in the districts and villages. Most of them don’t even have smartphones,” said tabla player Kuntal Roy, an ex-student of RKM-Rahara and the coordinator among the musicians.The group has already managed to raise Rs 21lakh. “Our beneficiaries and clusters are growing,” Sudipto said.Gourab, on his village tours, came across a mother and daughter in a neighbouring village who had gone without food for two days. “They work as domestic help and were without work. I ensured they got ration every week. I will personally visit them every week to check,” he said.",2020-08-05 23:02:00
1069,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus Lockdown: Many still don’t value rule of distance: Firhad Hakim - Telegraph India,"It is pointless to stay isolated for 23 hours and then be close to others for an hour in the market, Firhad Hakim said on Friday.Hakim, who is now the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, said the civic body would campaign extensively to make people understand the need to maintain distance.He chaired the first meeting of the board of administrators on Friday after the tenure of the elected board ended on Thursday. The government has appointed the board to carry on the civic body’s work.At the meeting, it was decided that councillors would be appointed as ward coordinators and borough chairpersons as borough coordinators to help the CMC in its fight against the pandemic by providing it with ground-level information.“I think some people still don't understand the need to maintain a minimum distance between two people,” Hakim said. “They think they are following distancing rules for 23 hours a day; so breaking it for an hour in the market is okay. But that is not right.”A CMC official said crowds at markets and slums and densely-populated parts of the city were a matter of concern for the civic body. Most of the new cases are coming from such pockets, in north and central Calcutta, the official said.After the tenure of the elected representatives ended on Thursday there were questions on the role of the elected councillors. “As elected representatives they would know their areas better and can help with the civic body’s surveillance work to detect people with symptoms of Covid-19,” an official said.A committee to combat Covid-19 was formed on Friday.

1070,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown films by New Town residents - Telegraph India,"The New Town authorities are making lockdown documentaries and they have asked residents to send videos and photographs of their “best lockdown moments”.An official of Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation said it was decided to make residents a part of the filmmaking process to keep them engaged while collecting the best photographs and videos of New Town.Debashis Sen, the chairman and managing director of Hidco, said they had decided to make the film because this was a time that had to be “chronicled and properly recorded”.“The entire city, including New Town, looks completely different now. As the air is cleaner, the skies look bluer and because of fewer vehicles, there is little noise. This is attracting a lot of birds to both Eco Park and Eco Urban village,” Sen said.According to another Hidco official, a photography contest had been started where residents could send their photographs. “The pictures and the videos sent by residents will be combined with those taken by us, including drone footage, to make the film,” the official said.",2020-08-05 23:03:00
1071,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus pandemic: Six Covid-19 tests at lab without ICMR nod in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Kankurgachhi clinic, which doesn’t have the permission to conduct Covid-19 tests, had done at least six such tests before its proprietor was arrested on Wednesday, police have said.The health department had sealed Tribeni Clinic the same day.Of the six tests, one was conducted on the proprietor of the clinic, Ratan Lal Gupta, to rule out the presence of the virus, Gupta has apparently told cops.Covid-19 test reports have to be mandatorily shared with the state health department. But the reports generated at the clinic were not shared with the government, the police said.Gupta is currently in police custody.According to government rules, no diagnostic laboratory in the country can conduct tests to detect Covid-19 without the approval of the Indian Council of Medical Research.Dr Lal’s Pathlabs, Tata Medical Center and Suraksha Diagnostic in New Town, AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals and Peerless Hospital are the five private facilities in Calcutta, which have the ICMR’s approval to conduct Covid-19 tests.The government facilities that have the ICMR’s approval to conduct tests are SSKM Hospital, NICED, School of Tropical Medicine, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Command Hospital and the New Town unit of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute.The ICMR protocol says an individual cannot just walk into a laboratory to get tested. A doctor’s prescription is needed to undergo the test.“We are still to find out if any of the six samples tested at the clinic are positive. The reports are in the official computer, which has been sealed by the state health department,” an officer of Phoolbagan police station said.The police had started an investigation following specific information about the alleged malpractice at the clinic.“The proprietor, who himself is a doctor, had been cheating people claiming he could conduct Covid-19 tests at his clinic and get the results faster than anyone else,” the officer said. “He used to charge Rs 4,000 for each test, which is slightly less than what is charged in authorised private hospitals.”The police are still to find out the source of the clinic’s test kits. The doctor has said he had used genuine kits for the tests but its source is still to be traced, an officer said.",2020-08-05 23:03:00
1072,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Indians working abroad stuck in city, helpless - Telegraph India","Many people from Calcutta who stay and work abroad are stuck in the city for weeks and are unable to return in the absence of flights.Many of them said they had contacted the embassies of their countries and have been told to take a flight out from Delhi or Mumbai. They have contacted the external affairs and civil aviation ministries but allegedly got no help. Air India is operating nearly 70 flights to several destinations for Indians abroad and those stuck in the country but till date Calcutta is not on the list.Archana Kaur, who works for a bank in Germany’s Frankfurt, is stuck in Calcutta for seven weeks. She had come to the city in the second week of March to meet her ailing father. Most European Union member states are allowing non-citizens who have resident permits, long-period visas and those whose family members are citizens of those countries to return.“I hold a resident permit but am unable to return. The German consulate in Calcutta had informed me about a KLM flight from Delhi. But how will I reach Delhi? I tried to go by road but my family members stopped me,” said Archana. “I am not allowed to work from India and all my leaves are getting exhausted. My bank is calling from Frankfurt every week to know about my status.” Archana said she had written to the external affairs and civil aviation ministries but there was no reply.IT professional Ankit Choudhary is stuck in Calcutta since March 17. He works in the Netherlands and his wife, who is a citizen of that country, is now there.The Netherlands embassy had told him that there was a KLM flight from Delhi. “I had written to the civil aviation ministry and they asked me to get in touch with Air India. I did so. But there is no flight from Calcutta. I need to be with my wife there,” said Ankit.There are at least hundred-odd people like him stuck in Calcutta.“Many of them are getting requests from their companies to rejoin work as the lockdown is gradually being lifted,” he said. “The Centre should have allowed travel agents to arrange for seats on these Air India flights for such passengers. The agents could have arranged for their transport in groups and everyone would have benefited. This could have boosted the travel industry to some extent,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.",2020-08-05 23:04:00
1073,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Covid-19 victor returns home after 38 days on ventilator in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A 51-year-old man who tested positive for Covid-19 and was on ventilator support for 38 days returned home on Friday, cured of the infection.Doctors who treated him cited the case to drive home the point that families should not lose hope if a patient infected with the coronavirus is put on a ventilator. The middle-aged man was admitted to AMRI Hospitals Dhakuria on March 29. The next day he was put on a ventilator. “He had been coughing for some time and had fever two days before he was admitted to the hospital. We did not think he could be infected with the coronavirus because he had not travelled abroad recently and met no one who had been abroad,” said the man’s wife, who was struggling hard to rein in her emotions while speaking.Saswati Sinha, a critical care specialist who led the team that treated the man, said they kept him on the ventilator even after he tested negative for Covid-19 towards the middle of April to let his lungs heal.An official of the hospital said the man had first tested negative on April 17 and again on April 18. The discharge protocol for Covid-19 patients says a patient could be discharged if she/he tests negative twice within 24 hours. The opinion of the doctors treating the person is also important. In the case of the 51-year-old, the condition of his lungs did not allow doctors to discharge him immediately after he tested negative. “He had very severe pneumonia. He had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and the lungs were not able to absorb oxygen. As a result, his lungs needed some time to heal,” said Sinha. “He was taken out of 24X7 ventilator support on May 2 and then put on a partial ventilator for 12 hours a day. Since Tuesday (May 5), he did not need any ventilator support,” said an official of the hospital. Sinha said there was no reason to think that someone on a ventilator would not pull through. “A ventilator is a life-saving tool and it is the reason why many patients with severely damaged lungs survive. Being on a ventilator is not the end of the road,” she said. The man, who runs an NGO and can be seen helping survivors and disaster management personnel at any disaster site with his first-aid providing team, tested positive the day after he was admitted.“I could first meet my husband almost four weeks after hospitalisation, when he started recovering. I did not tell my mother-in-law that he had tested positive for Covid-19. After he started to recover, I told her everything. She is now relieved,” said the man’s wife. “I am indebted to the doctors, nurses and all other staff at the hospital. I am also indebted to my neighbours who delivered essentials at our doorstep.”On Wednesday, a 68-year-old cancer patient who had tested positive for Covid-19 was discharged from Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. The man, a resident of Assam’s Silchar, is suffering from oral cancer and also has a history of gall bladder cancer, coronary bypass surgery and high blood sugar, an official of the hospital said.He was admitted to the hospital on April 20 for treatment of a mouth tumour.",2020-08-05 23:04:00
1076,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus pandemic: Fear leads to faulty swab - Telegraph India,"Test centres at 11 medical colleges across Bengal have to reject nearly 10 per cent of the swab samples they receive because of incorrect collection procedure, doctors said.Many laboratory technicians are either not reaching the entire depth of the nose or mouth of a person while collecting the swab or not filing properly the reports that accompany the samples, said several doctors, who attributed the lapse to fear of infection among health workers. If the swab sample is not properly collected, the RNA count will be too low for testing. Improper collection leaves the test reports inconclusive and necessitates fresh tests, thus delaying the process of identification of Covid-19 patients.“There is a range for the RNA count and when that doesn’t reflect in a sample , we realise it has not been collected properly,” said a senior doctor at the School of Tropical Medicine. “Fear may be preventing technicians from reaching the depths of the nose or mouth while running the swab.”The sample must be collected from the end of a person’s mouth or nose to allow detection of the virus. If the sample is collected half-way into the nasal or oral passage, the test report may be incorrect, doctors said. “After some of the samples started showing incomplete RNA count, we decided to hold a day’s class for technicians from parts of Bankura and Bishnupur to tell them again what should be done,” said a senior professor at Midnapore Medical College. Medical colleges in the city have started talking to lab technicians to allay their fears. Several technicians are  being counselled that the personal protection equipment ensures they do not contract infection even if someone sneezes during swab collection. “We have created a separate kiosk where the swab samples would be collected,” said a senior doctor of the RG Kar Medical College. “We are also engaging ENT doctors  for collecting swabs.”Senior officials of the health department said institutional heads have been advised to designate a senior doctor to monitor the work of lab technicians in every shift and clear doubts. “Regular training sessions are being held for skill upgrade,” said a senior health department official. “There may be a few cases of erroneous collection of swab samples but that is not the predominant trait. We are trying our best to address this.”",2020-08-05 23:05:00
1077,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus Lockdown: Hospital deploys bus for patients in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"One eye hospital in Calcutta has arranged a bus to ferry patients from different parts of the city to the hospital and back after its doctors were flooded with calls from people in need of consultations.Priyamvada Birla Aravind Eye Hospital, on the premises of Belle Vue Clinic, has been using one of its buses to ferry patients since Thursday, officials said. The bus is now operating on two routes — between the hospital and the Ruby crossing on EM Bypass and between the hospital and Ranikuthi — covering a radius of 8km. Hospital officials said they were not charging anything from the patients. “Since the lockdown, our doctors were getting frantic calls from patients, many of them elderly, for consultation. We have 15 doctors and each was getting 10 calls daily on an average. The patients were unable to come to the hospital because of the lockdown,” said Jayangshu Sengupta, the medical director of the eye hospital.“There are patients who underwent cornea transplant. They don't know whether their bodies have rejected the transplanted corneas. This is a vision-threatening condition and they need regular follow-ups,” said Sengupta.He said the hospital tried to tie up with yellow taxis after the state government had announced relaxations and then with app cabs, but both efforts failed. So, they are now using one of their buses to ferry the patients. Hospital officials said barely any patient opted for the service on the first two days. But on Saturday, as many as 12 had booked a ride. “We are using the patient database to provide information about the service. Those who are calling are also being informed about it,” said Sengupta.He said more routes were being planned in consultation with police and the transport department, keeping in mind the containment zones across the city. The non-availability of transport has also led Disha Eye Hospitals, which has units across the city and adjacent areas, to start tele-consultation. “We were planning to introduce tele-consultation in the coming days but the lockdown necessitated its introduction right now. We have completed 500 tele-consultations within a week of the launch and are getting 700 to 800 calls daily on our helpline,” said Debasish Bhattacharya, the chairman and managing director of the hospital chain.",2020-08-05 23:05:00
1078,Pranesh Sarkar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Nod for cycling on select roads of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The state cabinet has approved a policy of allowing bicycles on all small and medium roads in Calcutta and other major urban areas to ease the hardship to reach offices and other destinations in the absence of metro and local trains.“The Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue a notification mentioning small and medium roads where bicycles will be allowed. The decision has been taken considering that people are facing trouble to reach offices or work in the absence of metro,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at Nabanna on Monday.“People’s lives are most important.... Busy roads will be avoided to avert accidents. The Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue the list of roads after careful consideration.” Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma told The Telegraph: “We are working on a plan so that safety of cyclists is not compromised and... there is no disturbance to normal flow of traffic in the city.”Cycling is banned 24X7 on 22 thoroughfares in the city, including Park Street, Theatre Road, Camac Street, Red Road, Lalbazar Street, Council House Street, Rawdon Street and all flyovers. On 40 other thoroughfares such as Chowringhee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Central Avenue and some other roads, cycling is allowed from 11pm to 7am. During the lockdown, many people had cycled to work on these thoroughfares. Police sources said traffic cops had not prosecuted them on humanitarian grounds.“Usually, slow moving vehicles like a bicycle reduces the speed of other vehicles. That is the primary reason why they are not allowed on major thoroughfares. But we made an exception and did not prosecute cyclists during the lockdown as public transport was absent,” said an officer in the traffic police.There are separate cycle tracks in several parts of the country for free movement of cycles.Sources said the proposal — a temporary one because of non-availability of adequate public transport — was put forward by the heads of various departments after it was found that many employees could not reach office on Monday. Government offices started functioning with 70 per cent employees during the day.Various employees unions said attendance in different departments was around 60 per cent on Monday. “Many government employees stay in parts of North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly and depend on local trains and metro to reach office. These services are not available, so many employees could not reach office,” said a leader of the Trinamul-backed employees union.",2020-08-06 20:13:00
1079,Pranesh Sarkar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Bengal junior doctors’ stipend up - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has enhanced the stipend of nearly 10,000 junior doctors deployed mostly in state-run medical colleges and hospitals by at least Rs 4,425 a month, a move aimed at ensuring proper treatment of Covid-19 patients.“Despite the financial crisis the state is facing, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to enhance the stipend of junior doctors to acknowledge their effort to fight Covid-19,” junior health minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said on Monday.Sources in the state government said the move was timely because the number of Covid-19 cases was increasing rapidly in the state. “The junior doctors are the backbone of state-run healthcare establishments. They deserve a hike,” an official said.Bhattacharya also said the stipend of junior doctors would be revised whenever dearness allowance is announced for state government employees.Following the revision, the stipend of an intern increases from Rs 23,625 to Rs 28,050 and that of housestaff from Rs 38,391 to Rs 43,758.An official said the government had realised the importance of the junior doctors during the pandemic. “The difference was visible at MR Bangur Hospital, where a number of deaths were reported in the initial days after it was converted into a Covid-19 treatment centre. But soon after a number of junior doctors were sent to the hospital, the picture started changing,” said an official.",2020-08-06 20:13:00
1081,Pinak Ghosh,Coronavirus Lockdown: Luxury hotels of Calcutta try to lure customers with discounts and benefits - Telegraph India,"Eager to get their customers back, most luxury hotels in Calcutta are doing what they have seldom done before.Discounts of up to 50 per cent on room tariff and other facilities such as spa and sauna, concession on food rates at restaurants, flexible reservation and cancellation policies, digital menu cards replacing physical ones — the city’s star addresses opened on Monday after 74 days with a range of offers aimed at restoring the pre-Covid occupancy.The tariff of a deluxe twin room at JW Marriott is Rs 9,500 per night (without taxes). The EM Bypass hotel is offering almost half the price between June 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, if the booking is done this month, according to its website.The condition is that the bookings are non-transferable, meaning the person booking a room cannot transfer the booking to another individual.The Oberoi Grand is offering a 20 per cent discount on room tariff if the booking is made through its website.A customer ordered a 12-inch thin crust chicken pizza at The Bridge, a restaurant at The Park, on Monday. It cost Rs 1,210, instead of the usual price of Rs 1,593 (both include 18 per cent GST). The discounts on other food items ranged between 15 and 20 per cent.Hospitality majors such as Marriott, Taj Bengal and The Park said the idea was to increase the footfall after a prolonged lockdown and cater to the needs of the customers looking for food and room while keeping in mind the liquidity constraints.Not everyone has gone for a reduction in tariff — some are packaging benefits as part of the booking. Taj Bengal, for instance, is offering daily hotel credit of Rs 3,000 per room per night, which can be used for food and beverage, spa and laundry. The hotel is also offering upgrades to the next room category (except suites) based on availability and 20 per cent discount on salon and spa as part of the booking.The hotel is also offering flexible cancellation to avoid a penalty of one night, plus applicable taxes and fees, said officials.A major change is replacement of physical menu cards at restaurants in the hotels with digital ones. A guest has to scan a QR code to get the digital menu card on his or her mobile phone.“This is an innovation keeping in mind the safety and sanitisation requirements. It also has the benefit of tweaking the menu without the need to reprint,” said chef Sharad Dewan of The Park, Calcutta. It also saves cost.A key concern of most hospitality chains is the non-availability of certain items such as imported cheese, salmon, tuna etc. The other concern is that alcohol cannot be served, based on a government directive.The footfall at many of the star restaurants did not cross 20 per cent on the first day. The managements hope the offers will help push up the footfall.“We have introduced a scheme called ‘Save Now Stay Later’ across all our hotels in India. The scheme offers discounts ranging from 30 to 50 per cent. While the scheme is flexible, it’s not transferable. The offer is for a limited period and we will go back to normal rates,” said Gaurav Singh, general manager, JW Marriott, Calcutta.The hotels have also adopted a range of hygiene norms and are conveying them to prospective customers through various platforms to allay their concerns over contracting the coronavirus.“We are excited and relieved with the opening of our restaurants, at the same time we also understand that we have to move forward with caution and ensure complete safety for our guests and associates.... Hopefully the situation would gradually improve,” said Manish Gupta, general manager, Taj Bengal.",2020-08-06 20:31:00

When we contacted him over the phone, he said the key was with him,” an employee said.The caretaker is an employee of the PWD. The two employees went to the PWD office to find out what could be done.The PWD staff advised the employees to break the lock and enter the office, they said. But they refused and asked the PWD to find a solution.“As there were inadequate number of buses, it took me two-and-a-half hours to reach the office. Then we were asked to break the lock and enter,” said an employee.The health unit provides basic treatment to employees of various government departments that function from New Secretariat and also employees of the City Civil Court and the Bankshal Court.Asked about the norms to be followed in such cases, a PWD official whose office is in Salt Lake told Metro: “The caretaker should have left the keys, original or duplicate, with his colleagues before he left for his home state.”Several rounds of meetings were held between the employees of the state health unit and the staff of the PWD.“They (the PWD staff) kept insisting that we break the lock. We refused and waited till 4pm and then we left for home,” said an employee. They don’t know whether they would be able to enter the office on Tuesday.One of the employees said they hoped the PWD would work something out. When this newspaper contacted the caretaker, who is in his 50s, he said: “I have committed a small mistake. But a solution has been found and the employees could start entering the office from Tuesday.”He did not explain what the solution was.The caretaker said he would return to Calcutta once the train services resumed. The employees said they were under the impression that their office was sanitised with disinfectants before being reopened. “But as no one was around to open the office. It is clear the office has not been sanitised,” said an employee.",2020-08-06 21:11:00

A passenger exclaimed “great”. The driver said “pehli baar (for the first time)”.Not the usual chaos yet, but traffic in Calcutta resembled traffic in Calcutta for the first time since the lockdown was imposed 75 days ago to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.Police said there was nearly a 40 per cent increase in traffic volume this Monday compared to Monday last week.The passenger at Esplanade was excited that the roads were looking “somewhat like before”.It wasn’t a happy sight for many others, though.The number of private buses went up from around 700 to about 1,800. State transport department officials said about 1,600 government buses were on the roads, compared with the 1,000-odd last week.But that was hardly enough, given the number of people on the roads. Even late on Monday evening, people were trying to squeeze into crowded buses because there was no other way to reach home. A bus that was headed to Barrackpore from Esplanade shut its doors because it was packed. But still two men were seen hanging from the footboard.“Private buses that were there in the morning disappeared by the evening. I had to wait for 40 minutes at Beleghata to board a bus,” said Soumya Banerjee, an equity firm employee whose office is in Salt Lake. “I don’t know how to continue like this for the rest of the week,” said the Patuli resident.Every time a taxi drove in, a swarm of people chased it hoping for a seat. With so many people and so few transport options, distancing norms became a joke.“What will we do?” a police officer at Gariahat said, pleading helplessness.Private bus operators said they were still “testing the waters” to see if it was viable to run on old fares. “We hope by mid-week more commuters will be out on the streets,” said Rahul Chatterjee of the Bus Minibus Samanoy Samity. “We spoke to the transport minister today. Running full fleet for bus owners continues to be a challenge.”Transport department officials said they would soon call a meeting with private bus operators. “A sense of fear is holding back many drivers and conductors. We will talk to the owners again and try to allay the fears,” said an official.Close to 3,000 taxis were out on the roads on Monday, with state government offices opening with 70 per cent staff and many corporate offices logging in for the first time in nearly two-and-a-half months. Till the end of last week, only 800-odd yellow cabs had hit the roads. But cabbies were asking for astronomical sums or showing more interest in running shuttle services.“From Bypass, near Peerless Hospital, to Bosepukur, a taxi driver demanded Rs 500,” said Madhuri Basu, an employee of a private firm.Vehicles had to crawl on several arteries including Central Avenue, Beleghata Main Road, NSC Bose Road, AJC Bose Road and Diamond Harbour Road during rush hours.Across several parts of Calcutta, including Ranikuthi, Garia, Behala, Ballygunge, Beleghata and Ultadanga, autos ran with three passengers, all seated on the rear seat.“I drove to office in my car.

1088,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Complexes urged to keep tabs on elderly - Telegraph India,"Residents’ welfare associations of housing complexes should keep a close watch on the aged in their communities and let the police or civic bodies know if they need any help, Calcutta’s nodal officer for Covid-19 management said on Friday. The police and the civic bodies in and around Calcutta have been told to get in touch with the residents’ welfare associations and exchange phone numbers, said Alapan Bandyopadhyay, the state home secretary who was recently named Calcutta’s nodal officer for Covid management.“The members of the residents’ welfare associations of these complexes should have the phone numbers of ward coordinators, local police stations, the health department and other necessary numbers. The housing societies should be able to contact the authorities if there is any need,” Bandyopadhyay said. “On our part, we should have the phone numbers of officer-bearers of the associations. Police and municipal workers will establish this connection over the next few days.”Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Thursday spoken about the need to reach out to elderly people in gated communities and figure out a way to help them. At a meeting at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation on Friday, Bandyopadhyay said the police and the civic body would reach out to all housing societies or gated communities. Since health workers are often denied access to gated communities, the residents should keep tabs on the elderly neighbours themselves, he said. The police commissioners of Calcutta, Howrah and Bidhannagar and senior officials of the Howrah and North 24-Parganas district administrations attended the meeting. “We have seen that health workers get access to slums and middle-class neighbourhoods. But they are denied access to many gated communities. So we are requesting officer-bearers of the residents’ associations of the gated communities to keep a tab on the health of the elderly people living there,” Bandyopadhyay said. He said the nodal officer for North 24-Parganas was asked to adopt a similar strategy in Barrackpore and Dum Dum. On Thursday, Mamata asked officials to conduct a survey of senior citizens living alone, especially in urban areas, and set up a police helpline where one can seek help for elderly people.The chief minister said she had found out on Wednesday that one of her neighbours was ill and needed hospitalisation. “He is very senior. Both his daughters are professors. One of them came to visit him yesterday and then everybody came to know he had been running a temperature for three days, living alone…. Kalighat police station got him hospitalised immediately,” she had said.An official of the CMC said Friday’s meeting stressed the need to reach out to apartment buildings in Calcutta, Howrah, Bidhannagar and New Town. “All urban areas have to follow the same strategy. We are also asking all municipalities to open control rooms where people can reach out if they are in need,” he said. Bandyopadhyay said all municipalities have been told to increase the numbers of ambulances.",2020-08-08 03:10:00

Candidates need not visit any reporting centre amid the pandemic,” Mitra said.An official said a candidate would get a text message if all documents were accepted by a virtual reporting centre. “An alert will be sent if any document is rejected. He or she can log in and find out the reason for rejection. The candidate can also contact the central control room in the board’s office,” the official said.Documents will be physically verified when campuses reopen. The counselling is likely to start on August 12.A board official said that earlier the candidates would have to visit reporting centres for verification of documents after locking their choice for an institute. They would pay the semester fee only after their testimonials were vetted by the centre.The special measures also include making provisions to help students encountering connectivity issues so they could take part in the online counselling.The board has set up more than 17,000 service centres across the state where students without internet connectivity at home could register for counselling, upload documents and choose an institute where he or she would like to study. Earlier, such students would have to visit cyber cafes to get the work done.“Services at these centres will be free…. The list of the service centres will be announced soon,” said Mitra. Figures released by the board shows that 51 per cent of the students on the merit list are from the Bengal board, compared with 31 per cent from the CBSE.

But once this crisis is over, the sector will bounce back stronger than ever. People will start travelling — for business and leisure. Many people have been furloughed or have lost their jobs, creating a big gap. When the sector bounces back, there will be a demand for skilled professionals,” Bose said.Career prospects in hospitality management in the wake of the pandemic⚫The shift from online to physical classes⚫The lack of internships⚫What: Virtual Insights — an ABP initiative in partnership with IIHM presents a virtual session on “Careers in Global Hospitality Management”⚫Where: Zoom webinar⚫When: Sunday, 5-6pm⚫Registration: https://bit.ly/VIwithIIHMThe first 500 to register will be able to interact with the speakers directly on Zoom⚫Panel: Kumar Shobhan, general manager, Hyatt Regency Kolkata; Vijay Malhotra, cluster executive chef, ITC Royal Bengal and ITC Sonar; and Abdullah Ahmed, director, IIHM Delhi and associate director, Indismart Global ⚫Moderator: Suborno Bose, chairman and CEO of IIHM and IHC London ",2020-08-08 03:25:00
1091,Our Special Correspondent,Coronaviurs lockdown: Chartered flights get Bengal nod - Telegraph India,"The state government will allow chartered flights to bring back stranded people from abroad from August 10, provided they test negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before departure, officials said.The state government has prepared a standard operating procedure which states that a person from abroad with a negative test report (RT-PCR) need not stay in institutional quarantine for seven days, which they were earlier required to do.A number of chartered flights and evacuation flights had brought back people from Bengal stranded abroad till the state government suspended the services on July 1. Sources said this was the first step towards allowing evacuation flights to operate once again to Calcutta. The state government’s decision comes in the wake of the ministry of health and family welfare’s revised guideline which states that an international passenger with a Covid negative report within 96 hours before journey need not undergo institutional quarantine after landing in a city in India and can fly onwards immediately to their actual destination within the country. “.... the government of West Bengal has decided that presently only chartered flights carrying stranded Indian nationals from abroad having a negative test report (RT-PCR) conducted within 96 hours of flight departure may land at airports within the state of West Bengal,” states a letter from the state government to the external affairs ministry. The airlines whose aircraft will be hired for chartered flights should apply for a no-objection certificate from the state government by giving details such as the names of the sponsors who have hired the flights and an undertaking that all passengers have tested negative for Covid. On arrival, passengers will have to stay in home quarantine for 14 days. If they develop any Covid symptoms, they will have to contact the local medical officer or the state government.A public health expert in Calcutta said the incubation period for the novel coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, is five days, after which symptoms manifest.Evacuation flights to Calcutta were stopped on July 1, after the Bengal government requested the civil aviation ministry not to allow any such flight without a no-objection certificate from the state. When such flights were allowed, hundreds of evacuees, many of them medical students, had gone home straight from the airport in violation of the quarantine norm. A few days back, representatives of airlines had spoken to the airport authorities requesting them to urge the state government to allow resumption of evacuation flights. The Telegraph had on August 1 reported that the airline operators committee was planning to write to the state government on this. Later, the committee and the travel agents’ associations spoke to state government officials requesting them to allow evacuation flights.IndiGo airline said it was planning to provide aircraft for chartered flights. “We had operated around 15 chartered flights before July 1. Now, many operators are keen to hire aircraft,” said an official of IndiGo.“Calcuttans stuck in places such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Singapore are requesting us to operate chartered flights. We’ll arrange for such flights soon,” said Pallavi Singh, an official of Accretion Aviation, which arranges evacuation flights. “This is the first step but there are many passengers who might not get a seat on such chartered flights. So, the state government should think of allowing evacuation flights with the same SOP,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.State government officials said they were not allowing  evacuation flights by airlines like Air India because then the responsibility of testing would be on an individual.",2020-08-08 03:31:00
1092,Debraj Mitra,Coronaviurs lockdown: Gym comes home as fitness gear sales soar    - Telegraph India,"When you cannot go to the gym, bring the gym home.The sale of fitness equipment and weights has seen a sharp spike for domestic use in the past few months, according to several retailers in Calcutta.From treadmills and cycles to resistance tubes and dumb-bells, every equipment has takers.“There has been an almost 40 per cent jump in the sale of equipment like treadmills, cycles and cross trainers. The sale of dumb-bells, barbells and folding benches have registered a near 60 per cent rise. All of them are domestic orders,” Gagan Sachdev, the owner of Bodyline chain of stores, said.The chain has four stores — in Ballygunge, Hiland Park, City Centre II and Avani Mall.The spike has been visible since mid-April and has stayed so far, he said. Till March, Sachdev sold around 30 treadmills a month, from four stores combined. Since April, he has been selling over 50.Gyms have been shut from mid-March. But it took fitness freaks a while to realise the shutdown will be a lengthy affair.The trend is here to stay even after gyms reopen, according to retailers.Aishwarya Krishnan, 20, a rower and fitness enthusiast, was a regular at a Ballygunge gym before the lockdown. “But I am not ready to head to a gym now. My parents, too, are concerned. They have asked me to get whatever stuff I need and work out on the rooftop. That is what I have been doing for the past four months,” she said.Her list includes dumb-bells, barbells, kettlebell and resistance tubes. On Friday afternoon, she did an hour’s workout with resistance tubes on the rooftop of her Lake Road home.Rajdeep Lahiri, a Tollygunge resident, ordered a treadmill in the second week of May. “I used to run for three 15-minute sessions at a local gym to lose weight. Since the gym shut down, I tried running at a park. But the number of people at the park kept increasing with every passing day. So, I thought of buying one.”Even those who are not fitness freaks have woken up to the concept of fitness, thanks to the pandemic, Adeep Kapoor, the third-generation owner of GK Sports, said. “They are ordering treadmills and cycles.”GK Sports has outlets on Ballygunge Circular Road and Park Street.His stores have seen “an at least 50 per cent jump” in the sale of fitness equipment. Apart from treadmills and the usual dumb-bells, the hot-selling items include skipping ropes, toning tubes and twisters, Kapoor said.Lifters are not to be left behind. Sukhdeep Singh, 22, bought a pair of dumb-bells and barbells. “I cannot do without my daily dose of workout. Gym is better but if not, home has to be acceptable,” Singh, a Sinthee resident, said.Amid the craze for ordering equipment, strength and conditioning coach Ranadeep Moitra had a word of caution.“Any machine-based workout should be under the guidance of a trainer. Random use of treadmills and other equipment can lead to aberrations in muscles and injuries. If people are hesitant to step out, they can take the advice of trainers online,” Moitra, the co-owner of Endorphins chain, known for training schedules that are not machine intensive, said.",2020-08-08 03:36:00
1093,Kinsuk Basu,Coronaviurs outbreak: Plasma therapy for select patients at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has decided to start plasma therapy for a select group of Covid-19 patients as an alternative treatment at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.Immunohaematology experts will join a team of doctors engaged in treating Covid patients and decide who all can get plasma therapy, depending on their degree of infection and status of immunity. A team of doctors will closely monitor those receiving plasma therapies.“We will start this therapy, hopefully, in the next two weeks,” Prasun Bhattacharya, the head of the department of Immunohaematology and blood transfusion at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, said.The hospital is now a dedicated Covid treatment centre. “Given the rise in the number of Covid patients, we had to start this therapy,” Bhattacharya said.In plasma therapy, plasma from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid is transfused to a critically ill Covid patient. The blood of a person who has recovered from Covid develops antibodies. When injected into the blood of another patient, these antibodies are supposed to help the patient fight the virus.Doctors will rely on the plasma bank that is coming up at the hospital, a health department official said. Plasma cells — donated by people who have recovered from Covid — from the bank will be infused into patients undergoing treatment for the disease, the official said.Plasma collected from the blood of a person three to four weeks after he/she has recovered from Covid is expected to contain antiviral antibodies.As part of the therapy, a patient will get 200ml of plasma, thawed after being stored in -80 degrees centigrade, daily for two days. After a few days, the blood will be analysed for immune-response. “We have decided that only critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will be chosen for the therapy,” Yogiraj Ray, a specialist in the Covid expert committee set up by the health department, said.“There is no shortage of plasma donors now; so, getting plasma will not be a challenge. A team of specialists will take the final call on the patient to receive plasma therapy. This team will include an expert in medico-legal affairs.”Several states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, have already started plasma therapy as an alternative treatment for patients whose oxygen requirement progressively increases despite using steroids.Several private healthcare units in Delhi and Maharashtra have been giving plasma therapy to patients. In Calcutta, this alternative mode of treatment has started in a few private units.“We tried plasma therapy on a young patient. He showed signs of improvement but unfortunately we couldn’t save him,” Rupali Basu, the CEO of Woodlands, said.The infrastructure is ready at the Calcutta Medical College, a health department official said. The Drug Controller General of India has given the permission for this treatment.The immediate requirement, though, is kits to collect plasma. “Each kit costs anything between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000. We are getting kits so that plasma can be collected and stored in the bank,” the health department official said.The treatment will have nothing to with the ongoing randomised controlled trial on plasma therapy, Dipyaman Ganguly of the Translational Research Unit at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology said. The trial is taking place at the Beleghata ID Hospital and initial findings have thrown up encouraging results. “We expect to complete the trial in another one-and-a-half months,” Dipyaman Ganguly said.",2020-08-08 03:48:00
1094,Subhajoy Roy,Advanced CT-scan unit at Fortis - Telegraph India,"Fortis Hospital in Anandapur has introduced a CT scan machine, which gives faster and clearer pictures of the lungs and the heart and helps doctors diagnose clots in the lungs of a Covid patient, doctors of the hospital said on Friday.The machine will be able to take images of every bit of the chest in one go and the patient need not be brought again and again for taking images of various organs.A city-based pulmonologist said pulmonary embolism, a blockage in pulmonary arteries of the lungs, is common in Covid-19 patients and doctors conduct CT scans to detect the complication.“At a time when the number of tests were low, a CT scan of the lungs was done to assess whether someone had symptoms of Covid-19. But now tests are done to assess the complications in a Covid patient,” said Sumit Sengupta, a city-based pulmonologist.Raja Dhar, a pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital, said clots in segmental arteries or branches of the pulmonary artery have also been noticed in Covid-19 patients. “The CT scan that we introduced in our hospital will be able to detect the clots even in the segmental arteries that an older CT scan machine may miss.”A CT scan gives more detailed pictures of organs inside a human body and allows doctors to diagnose an illness better. The images produced by a CT scan is more detailed, said a radiologist.The machine will also help in diagnosing ailments in elderly, children and trauma patients. “Unlike the older machine, this one can take the picture so fast that a trauma patient with multiple injuries does not need to be sedated before they are put in the gantry,” said Salim Pervez, the head of radiology of Fortis Hospital, Anandapur.Pervez added that children and elderly patients, too, would benefit.",2020-08-08 03:58:00
1095,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronaviurs outbreak: Drive in for contactless pandal-hopping this Durga puja - Telegraph India,"This Puja, Calcutta will get to experience drive-in darshan of the goddess.Three pujas in a lane near the Rashbehari Avenue crossing have joined forces to offer an experience for which one would not have to get out of the safety of one’s car. The idol will be right on the streetside facing the street and one will simply have to slow down in front of the pandal, take a look and drive on.Two of the three pujas figure among south Calcutta’s crowd-pullers — Badamtala Ashar Sangha and 66 Palli. A third along the lane — Kalighat Nepal Bhattacharjee Street Club — has been pulled in to complete the triad.“This is the first time in the history of the city’s Durga puja that three pujas are coming together. Desperate times call for desperate measures. With social distancing being a mandatory safety norm, drive-in is the one way in which pandal-hopping can take place without jostling in the crowd,” said Sandip Chakraborty, the secretary of Badamtala Ashar Sangha.The idea was mooted by New York-based businessman Mridul Pathak who has roots in the neighbourhood and whose non-profit outfit International Foundation for Sustainable Development (IFSD) has been involved with Durga Puja since the mid-90s. Speaking to The Telegraph from Texas, he said: “The boys were crest-fallen at the uncertainty over organising Puja this year. So I called them together in a video conference in June. Here in the US, all shopping malls have started a drive-in counter whereby people pay online in advance and simply pick up their order from the counter without getting off the car. “Even if things do not improve by October in Bengal, people will still go out by car. So I told them to make the pandal two-dimensional, cutting out the third dimension of depth which requires visitors to go closer to the idols. That way people can watch while simply driving by. Another lane can be kept for pedestrians. Traffic would be easier to control if all three pujas in the lane follow the same principle. This will reduce budget and yet allow each club to retain its autonomy.”The drive-in concept is gaining ground across the world because of the zero-contact experience. Drive-in theatres, popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s, are making a comeback. Walmart, for instance, has announced transforming its parking lots at 160 stores across the US into drive-in theatres with customers having to sign up to reserve parking space. Each site usually has a pole with a speaker. Bangalore has started one in July. Drive-in eateries are also starting, with two already in operation in the city — in New Town and Salt Lake. “So why not drive-in Durga puja?” said Pathak. IFSD is facilitating a digital campaign to market the concept.Badamtala already had Satyajit Ray in mind as the theme, given that this is the start of his centenary year. With three pujas on board, the Apu trilogy became a natural choice. “Badamtala will portray Pather Panchali, we will do Aparajito while Kalighat Nepal Bhattacharjee Street Club will do Apur Sansar,” said Pradyumna Mukherjee, the general secretary of 66 Palli Sarbojanin.He pointed out that the area is connected to the trilogy. “Bachan Singh, the owner of Bachan’s Dhaba on the main road, from where our drive-in route will start, used to be a taxi driver earlier. It was his duty to drive the young Subir Banerjee, who played Apu in Pather Panchali, to the shooting spot every day,” he said. A second link is a scene in Aparajito where Apu is leaving the village after his mother’s death. “When his great uncle asks why he was leaving without performing the last rites in the village, Apu replies that he would do it at the Kalighat temple, which is right next door to us,” Mukherjee added. The organisers have asked their theme maker duo, Eshika Chandra and Deep Das, to incorporate the scene in the pandal décor.The worsening Covid-19 infection graph has kept all plans on tenterhooks. “We have only decided on an 11ft idol. How elaborately we can execute the theme will depend on the time we get once the government gives the go-ahead,” said Snehasish Maity, who is in charge of the Badamtala pandal.Chakraborty plans some basic safety measures — a piped sanitising shower for the cars at the entry point, hand sanitisation and thermal  check for pedestrians, and no stalls next to the pandal. “We want to dedicate the entire stretch to Ray. Food stalls, if any are allowed, will be booked in the lane between us and 66 Palli.”Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) observed the 79th death anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore at the Jorasanko Thakurbari, the poet’s ancestral house, on Friday. A team of senior RBU officials paid tribute to the poet at the Nimtala crematorium, where he was cremated. The team then went to the Thakurbari and placed flowers in the rooms where the poet was born and breathed his last. The officials then garlanded the poet’s bust.Since Tagore passed away in 1941, a programme remembering him would be held at the Thakurbari on this day. “The programme had to be cancelled this time because of the pandemic,” vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhury said.",2020-08-08 04:08:00
1096,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus outbreak: ‘Body swap’ at BR Singh Hospital - Telegraph India,"The body of a woman who died at BR Singh Hospital after testing negative for Covid-19 has been handed over to the CMC for cremation instead of a Covid positive person’s body, her family has alleged.The Telegraph could not contact the hospital.Family members of the woman, a 67-year-old Howrah resident, have made the allegation in a letter to Narkeldanga police station. They said the hospital called them on Friday to collect the body as her test reports were negative.On reaching the hospital they were handed over another body. It was then they got to know the woman’s body had been handed over to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for cremation two days ago in an apparent case of mistaken identity with another woman who had died of Covid-19, the family has said in the letter.The family received a communication from the hospital, signed by its director, saying the body had been “wrongly handed over after identification of the dead body” by the other woman’s son. The letter said the process of handing over the body had been videographed. This woman died on July 31 and the Howrah resident on August 3.

1098,Ayan Paul,Work-from-home has been a boon for pet lovers - Telegraph India,"If you have been working from home from the beginning of the pandemic and have pets at home, chances are you have been having mixed feelings about having them around. While it is surely a joy to have them for company, it can also be a hindrance sometimes if they get in the way of your work. But when t2 spoke to a few pet owners from cities, most of them felt that the plusses outweigh the minuses. They recount their funny and unique experience of being 24x7 with their dear ones and enjoying their work more now thanks to them…Milk and Cookie are now super excited as their guardian is with them 24x7 and they are going out to walk twice a day instead of twice a week for the first time in three years of their existence. For the twin Pomeranians, it’s like a weekend that’s never ending. “I have always been in advertising agencies and I have to work under immense pressure. So I always felt guilty because I couldn’t give much time to them. I used to spend hardly three hours with them. But now I’m with them always and can take them out anytime. So the pandemic becomes a blessing in disguise for us,” said Kobita Banerjee, a 32-year-old who works with an ad agency in Bangalore.Pikachu and Dobby are so happy nowadays that they are eating more than what they usually do. Pikachu is a three-year-old cat while his sister Dobby is one year old. “When my cats used to be alone, they would often fall asleep and skip their meals. But now since I’m with them all the time, they are always awake and having lots of food. They have gained weight in the last few months,” said Anna Sakhi John, a content writer based in Chennai.Pocket, Golla and Lakkhi have at last found freedom to play whenever and wherever they want. “My cats have a problem with vision. So when I’m not at home, they are not allowed to go out of their room and play. But now things have changed. I’m always with them and they can go out and play whenever they want,” said Chaitali Chakraborty, a 26-year-old IT professional from Calcutta.Suvarghya Dutta has turned his study into a mini office and he has found two new ‘colleagues’ — his pets Portia and Martini. Both are seven-year-old Indian dogs. Suvarghya has to keep the door of his study open and the two enter and leave the room whenever they want as they like to stay with him all the time! “Unless there is a very important meeting when I need a calm and quiet environment, Portia and Martini are always with me,” said the 47-year-old who works in an IT firm and is based out of Calcutta.Kobita has also set up her workspace in her living room and Milk and Cookie sit under Kobita’s desk as long as she works. The two now spend more time watching Kobita work than barking at people from the balcony. “My colleagues say jokingly that my dogs must have thought I have been fired,” said Kobita.Chaitali’s office colleagues are now used to seeing Golla running over her laptop and Pocket screaming “meow meow” in front of the laptop when a meeting is in progress. “It’s a welcome change for them as well,” said Chaitali. Golla is seven years old and his two sisters, Pocket and Lakkhi, are one-and-half years and one year old respectively.Pikachu and Dobby always walk around Anna when she works. “It gets difficult during meetings as they often come and jump on my laptop. However, my colleagues take it sportingly,” said the 29-year-old.Whatever Chaitali does throughout the day, be it having breakfast, watering the plants or taking a stroll on the terrace, Golla and gang are always there with her. Portia and Martini even sleep in Suvarghya’s study only to be with him always. Anna said: “When I’m at home, my cats don’t like to be in any other room even for a few minutes. It keeps bothering them if I don’t allow them in my room. They follow me wherever I go.”Milk and Cookie often take a ball and put it on Kobita’s lap when she works. Sometimes they put their heads on her lap. “It’s like ‘please play with us’. They are like children. So they seek attention and want to get pampered. I also love to spend time with them. These little breaks are very much necessary for me. Moreover, when I feel sad or I’m not in a great mood, they can easily sense it and they immediately come to me and try to lift my mood,” said Kobita.Suvarghya feels the presence of Portia and Martini is a huge stress buster for him. “I love to play with them. It helps me rejuvenate myself and concentrate on my work better. It’s actually reducing the stress of work.”For Chaitali, having her cats always by her side gives her immense energy. “Before lockdown, it was like a 10am-7pm job for me. But now since I’m at home, I have to work almost 10 hours a day. So seeing them and playing with them in between work gives me a lot of positive energy,” Chaitali quipped.",2020-08-09 00:57:00

Officers said his cellphone was switched off.The investigators met Pandey’s mother and sought details about her son and the keys to his Honda City, found parked in the garage.According to sources, Pandey’s mother said she did not have the car keys, nor did she know where he was. This newspaper could not contact the family for their version.Officers said the police had seized the Honda City on Monday, towing it away from the garage.The police have registered a case invoking the charges of attempt at culpable homicide not amounting to murder, outraging a woman’s modesty, rash and negligent driving, and causing grievous hurt by an act that endangers lives. Conviction can lead to a maximum of three years in jail.A man whom the police had detained on Sunday night for questioning has been released. Police sources said he was attached to the showroom from where the Honda City had been bought, and had been summoned to the police station to provide details about the vehicle’s owner.Pandey, who the police said works with a private insurance firm, had allegedly assaulted the woman in the car when she insisted on being dropped at her home as it was past midnight.She was allegedly pushed out of the car when Nilanjana’s husband, hearing the woman’s screams, pulled his car over in front of the Honda City, blocking its way.As Nilanjana got off the Maruti Alto to help the woman, the Honda City turned round and sped away, crushing her left leg.Asked why the police had failed to arrest Pandey till late Monday night despite securing his phone number and address on Saturday night, officers at Anandapur police station blamed the initial confusion over the suspect’s name.",2020-08-09 01:46:00

In all, around 28,000 passengers travelled,” an official at the airport said. On May 28, the day services resumed after the lockdown, 11 flights had taken off and a similar number arrived. About 3,000 passengers had travelled through the airport that day.On Sunday, 16,350 passengers took flights out of Calcutta and 11,727 passengers arrived.As the number of passengers has started increasing, lounges, bars, food courts and retail stores at the terminal are opening up and their business has started picking up, officials said.Several airlines said many flights for Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and Bangalore were overbooked and some were full.Officials of several airlines said about 85 passengers on Sunday were first-time fliers, many of whom were returning to the cities where they were working. There were businessmen, too, among the fliers.Many patients who were waiting to get treated at hospitals in Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai have started travelling following the Centre’s announcement of Unlock 4 and the Bengal government’s decision to allow resumption flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur three days a week. Flights from the six cities to Calcutta were suspended on July 6, following a request from the state government, because of high Covid prevalence there.Even in August, the number of passengers taking flights out of Calcutta daily was below 10,000.  Airport officials said that on Sunday, Vistara operated a Boeing B787 Dreamliner aircraft on the Calcutta-Delhi-Calcutta route. In all, 293 passengers flew out of the city and 272 flew in on the aircraft, which can seat around 300 passengers.AirAsia sources said the airline had been operating three flights every day since operations resumed. On Sunday, the airline operated six.IndiGo officials said the airline was operating around 35 flights daily last month. The number went up to 52 on Sunday and most had cent percent occupancy.The increase in the number of flights and passengers is helping food and beverage, and retail stores to come back to business. “Most retail and F&B stores have opened and they are having a decent number of passengers,” airport director Kaushik Bhattacharya said.After the state government gave permission, bars at the airport have started opening up, too. Ultra Bar, operated by Travel and Food Services, opened last week. TFS, which operates the lounges at the airport, said it's domestic section lounge has started serving passengers again and the number is picking up.“Over 130 days post-lockdown and airports reopening, we have seen a very positive growth in passenger traffic and spending sentiment. Transaction Averages are back to pre-Covid levels and I am confident as new flights get added, we will improve the penetration further and get back sales. From less than 30 passengers a day to 180 passengers, we have seen the lounge penetration grow over the last few weeks, thereby indicating the growing passenger confidence,” said Gaurav Dewan, COO & Business Head, TFS.Metro reported on Sunday that the state government was allowing air transport bubble flights from international destinations to Calcutta provided only those who test negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before departure are allowed to board the aircraft.",2020-08-09 03:49:00
1101,Monalisa Chaudhuri,21 trafficked children from Bihar rescued near Maidan - Telegraph India,"A group of 21 minors from Bihar’s Samastipur, all alleged victims of trafficking, was rescued from a bus in the Maidan area early on Monday.Police said the children, aged between 12 and 14, were being taken to Howrah to work in bangle factories. Most of the children told the police that they were under the impression that they had been brought to Calcutta for a picnic, but some apparently knew that they would be made to work.Three men in their 20s who were accompanying the children have been arrested on charges of human trafficking and criminal conspiracy. The children have been handed over to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC).According to the official procedure, family members of each of the 21 children will be contacted and asked to appear before the committee. “The children will be allowed to go home only if the CWC is satisfied with the family members’ explanation on why they were allowed to leave home. Else, the kids will stay back in government homes,” an officer said.The Child Labour Amendment (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 2016, does not allow children below the age of 14 to work except as a child artiste or in a family business not deemed hazardous. Parents are liable to be punished if they are found to have engaged their children below 14 in work in violation of the act.Several police officers Metro spoke to said the rescue of so many victims of human trafficking at one go in the city was rare.“These things happen in suburbs. We rarely get any human trafficking cases in proper Calcutta except while conducting raids at brothels or parlours. But so many children being trafficked together in a bus is unusual,” said a senior officer of Calcutta police.The bus was intercepted near Babughat around 5.30am. Calcutta and Howrah police had set up night pickets to intercept the bus following a tip-off from Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO, which gave specific information about the vehicle and the 21 children who were being allegedly trafficked.“The children underwent an overnight journey from Samastipur, around 550km from Calcutta. The plan was that the bus would stop for a while near Babughat, from where the children were to be sent to Howrah in smaller groups in various vehicles to avert police glare,” an officer said.Bengal is among the states that account for maximum trafficking cases in the country. Hundreds of children and women are smuggled out of the state — at times with false hopes of livelihood and at other times with false promises of marriage.“It is easy to lure poor people with money and pretension of love. Many girls in villages in South 24-Parganas go missing after falling in love with strangers, whose real identity and intention are hidden from them till it is too late. By the time they realise, the girls have been sold,” said Bappaditya Mukherjee of Prantakatha, an NGO that deals with trafficking survivors.Mukherjee said widespread joblessness during the Covid pandemic had left children and their parents more vulnerable to migration and trafficking. In a large number of cases, it is found that children have been forced to leave home by their poor parents who are in desperate need of cash to run their families.",2020-08-09 03:53:00
1102,"Kinsuk Basu , Subhajoy Roy",Kolkata molestation case: Four-hour surgery to fix saviour’s leg - Telegraph India,"The 48-year-old woman who showed exemplary courage and saved a younger woman who was allegedly attacked and thrown off a speeding Honda City on Saturday night underwent a four-hour surgery on Monday.Nilanjana Chatterjee will have to spend a few more days in complete rest at the hospital before doctors make her walk again with support. She can only be discharged after at least a week, doctors have told the family. Returning back to normal life will take a few more months.An official of Ruby General Hospital, where Chatterjee is admitted, said the surgery was done to fix the tibia and fibula bones of her left leg, both of which broke after the Honda City ran over her leg.“The doctors inserted titanium rods, plates and screws in her leg to fix the bones. She is doing better and has been taken out of the intensive care unit. She also underwent a plastic surgery as a portion of the skin tore open and the interior of the leg got exposed when the car ran over her leg,” said the official.Nilanjana’s husband Deep Satpati, who was at the hospital, said that a longer battle for recuperation would now begin. “It was a long surgery. Surgeons told me they had to carry out grafting of several injuries of the bone. She needs to be in the hospital for at least a week,” Deep said.He was speaking around 4.30pm, shortly after Nilanjana was wheeled out of the operating theatre. The couple’s daughter, who works for an e-learning platform, was present at the hospital.  “It will be another battle now till Nilanjana can stand on her legs and walk. Doctors have warned that there should not be any infection,” Deep said. “There are a few spots which have been left open. Doctors said if they had closed them, the skin below would have started to rot.”The family decided that after discharge, Nilanjana would be taken to her parent's apartment at Abhyudoy Housing Complex, which is close to the hospital. A nurse who takes care of her ailing father will look after her as well.The couple and their daughter live at a housing complex near the intersection of EM Bypass and Prince Anwar Shah Road.Late in the evening, Deep visited Anandapur police station and submitted a complaint alleging that the man who was driving the Honda City had tried to kill his wife through rash driving while taking a U-turn. The complaint has been tagged to the main case of alleged molestation.“Officers have said we might have to testify as witnesses in court after the accused is arrested. We will do it,” Deep said.A Ruby official said usually patients were discharged from hospital after tibia/fibula surgery when they were in a position to walk with help of a walker. “It takes about 5 to 7 days for a person to be able to walk with a walker. They are discharged when they can go to the washroom or perform other basic functions without any help from others,” said the official.",2020-08-09 04:03:00
1103,Subhajoy Roy,CMDA seeks nod from NGT for Chhath at Rabindra Sarobar - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), the custodian of Rabindra Sarobar, has filed a review petition at the National Green Tribunal seeking a “special permission” to allow Chhath Puja at the Sarobar.The tribunal has banned any kind of puja celebrations on the 192-acre Sarobar campus.The authorities had locked the gates of the Sarobar on the day of Chhath Puja last year but thousands of devotees broke open the locks and entered the premises.A CMDA official said their petition before the NGT was a “suo motu” action. The official was asked why the CMDA, whose duty as custodian is to protect the sprawling water body and the surrounding greens, was seeking a relaxation of the ban. He said the agency was doing so because the matter involved “the emotion of lakhs of people and the CMDA was not in a position to stop a mob” from entering the premises.“We are not a law enforcement agency. From our experience last year, only a lathicharge or use of force could have stopped the people from entering the campus and we did not want that to happen,” a CMDA official said.State urban development and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim told Metro: “Yes, we have filed a review petition for allowing Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar. We do not want police to use force on people coming to participate in a religious programme.”There are many who have been performing Chhath Puja rituals at the Sarobar for decades and the authorities did not want to hurt their sentiments, Hakim said.In its petition, the CMDA says it took all possible steps to improve the condition of the Sarobar and reduce pollution. The review petition, filed early last month, is likely to be heard towards the middle of this month, a source said.",2020-08-09 04:06:00
1104,Subhankar Chowdhury,Leave ‘highly risky’ campus: IIT to students - Telegraph India,"IIT Kharagpur has requested the 60-odd students still on the campus to leave at the earliest as it is “highly risky” to stay in hostels amid the Covid-19 pandemic considering the “stressed and insufficient medical facilities” in the town.The dean of students’ affairs at the institute, Somesh Kumar, has written to the students saying: “Due to stressed and insufficient medical facilities in Kharagpur, it is highly risky to stay put in hostels. I again request all of you to please make arrangements to reach your home and stay with your family members as early as possible.”A spike in the number of Covid cases on the campus has prompted the IIT authorities to shut down the campus at least for a week till September 13.The dean’s letter follows a joint appeal from research scholars to director V.K. Tewari on Sunday that the students who had gone home be called back and research activities resumed as soon as possible.An official said the dean in his mail had drawn attention to the rising case count on the campus as well as immediate surroundings. Besides, the outpatient department of BC Roy Technology Hospital on the campus has been closed till further orders.“The dean is justified in saying that the medical facilities in Kharagpur are insufficient,” the official said.South Eastern Railway Main Hospital, about a kilometre from the IIT campus, is operational but had to be closed for a few days earlier after several doctors and nurses tested positive. “There are hardly any beds in the state hospital outside,” the dean has written, referring to Kharagpur Subdivisional Hospital near the campus.Midnapore Medical College and Hospital is about 17km away.A West Midnapore district official denied any paucity of Covid beds. But many on the campus said they were still reliant on hospitals in Calcutta for critical treatment.A scholar said their appeal to the director to let research resume followed an order from the ministry of home affairs on August 29 that said higher educational institutions would be permitted to function only for research scholars and postgraduate students of technical and professional programmes requiring laboratory/experimental work.A professor said the order was not applicable to the IIT because of a steady rise in the number of Covid cases on the campus and outside.Close to 3,500 students were on the campus till June 20, the day the first order on vacating the campus was issued.",2020-08-09 04:09:00
1105,Debraj Mitra,Fish fingerlings to save Sunderbans from erosion - Telegraph India,"Around 20 families in a Sunderbans village will get fish fingerlings to be reared in five ponds.The conservationists and foresters behind the project are hoping that the scope of an alternative livelihood will prevent the families from carrying on an old fishing practice that makes the riverbeds more prone to erosion and also increases the risk of man-wild conflict.During low tide, large fishing nets are cast along exposed or shallow river bed (chor) and across creeks (khal) inside forests. The water incursion during high tide leads to a haul of fish — big and small — trapped in the nets.When the water recedes, the nets are taken away by fishermen. When dragged manually, these nets — many of them spanning over a kilometre — destroy numerous mangrove saplings swept onto the river bed by tidal waters.Mangroves are known for viviparous germination where seeds germinate and develop into saplings while still attached to the parent tree. Sapling-bearing fruits shed by mangroves are washed away during low tide and brought to the land during high tide. Back on land, they form mangrove colonies over a period of time.“People are dependent on these practises to earn livelihood. But in the process, they are damaging the delicate ecosystem of the Sunderbans. Storms have depleted a sizable chunk of the mangroves. The destruction of saplings is making river beds more barren and prone to erosion. The nets across the creeks inside the forest make people more vulnerable to tiger attacks,” said Suvrajyoti Chatterjee of Human and Environment Alliance League (HEAL), the NGO that is providing the alternate livelihood to the families.At least 17 fishermen have been killed by tigers in the Sunderbans this year. The pandemic has robbed people of livelihoods and more people are turning to fishing, said foresters and activists.The families getting the fingerlings are from Purba Gurguria village in Kultali block of South 24-Parganas. Indigenous catfish fingerlings will be released into five ponds in the village, each to be looked after by four families.“We are releasing 60,000 fingerlings, 12,000 for each pond,” said a HEAL volunteer.A forest official who had helped in the project said the project could be implemented on a larger scale across the mangrove delta.“This should have been done much before. But the challenge is to keep the fishermen away from river beds and creeks for the next six months — the time taken for the fish to grow in the ponds,” said the official.“We go fishing, risking our lives, to run our families, not because we love going there. If there is another way of earning, I will not go fishing,” said Amalesh Bhunia, a beneficiary of the project.",2020-08-09 04:12:00
1106,Snehal Sengupta,"Car falls into VIP Road canal, 1 dead - Telegraph India","A 32-year-old Dum Dum resident was killed after the cab he was travelling in rammed into the culvert of the Kestopur canal on the airport-bound flank of VIP Road and plunged into water around 2am on Monday, police said.Ratan Das, an ambulance driver, was headed home to Dum Dum’s Rabindranagar and was on the rear seat, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said. He got trapped inside the vehicle when it submerged in the water. The driver managed to get out of the vehicle and fled on foot, the officer said.“The car was speeding and the driver lost control. There are no signs on the road such as tyre marks to indicate that the driver had braked to avoid ramming into the culvert,” the officer said.“A probe has been started to track down the driver. We have got in touch with the owner of the vehicle to find out how long the driver was at the wheel at a stretch.”Metro visited the accident spot on Monday morning and found that the culvert on VIP Road appears suddenly after a smooth wide stretch. The road forks into a Y and can take those who are not used to driving down the stretch by surprise.There are no signs on VIP Road warning motorists about the culvert. There are no reflectors or reflective paint on the wall of the culvert. Guardrails fitted with reflective tapes were erected only on Monday afternoon.A couple of vegetable sellers who were on their way to a wholesale market in Rajarhat rushed to the Baguiati traffic guard nearby and alerted the cops about the accident.A crane was deployed and it took more than 30 minutes to take the vehicle out of the water.Das was lying slumped on the back seat. He was taken to a nearby nursing home, where he was declared dead.Shimul Mondal, one of the vegetable sellers who alerted the cops, told this newspaper that he saw the car hit a concrete slab of the culvert before falling into the water. “I rushed there but realised that I will not be able to do anything as the car was at least five feet below the road’s level and was sinking. I alerted the cops,” said Mondal.",2020-08-09 04:17:00

1108,Debraj Mitra,Filmmakers pay tribute to Father Gaston Roberge - Telegraph India,"Father Gaston Roberge: father of film studies, great lover of Calcutta, the founder of a first-of-its-kind film centre and the proponent of seeing Indian cinema in an Indian context.The many facets of Father Roberge were relived on Sunday evening as a group of filmmakers paid their tributes to the Jesuit priest-turned-film academic who died on August 26. He was 85.Filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Buddhadeb Dasgupta and Goutam Ghose were among the participants in the virtual session, moderated by film critic and journalist Saibal Chatterjee.Gopalakrishnan described Father Roberge as the pioneer of film studies in eastern India before listing his “very very important” contribution.“I had very few opportunities of meeting him…. But I knew about him because he is the one who started film appreciation as a subject of study in the eastern part of India, particularly in Bengal,” Gopalakrishnan said.“Original Indian work is not very accustomed to the West. This I have understood from the experience of my life.... Father Gaston Roberge has really contributed a great deal to the fact that Indian cinema has to be understood against the perspective of our culture. That’s very very important.“When you see a small thatched house, you don’t see facilities attached to modern life; you seem to consider them poor. As long as the person gets what he needs, he is not poor…. Despite not having all the facilities of modern life, people are not unhappy. They are happy with what they have. Our greatest contribution… renounce, and be happy. This has to be understood.”The webinar on the life, works and legacy of Father Roberge was organised by the St Xavier’s College (Calcutta) Alumni Association in association with The Telegraph. The event was supported by the Film Federation of India.Father Roberge founded Chitrabani, a centre for film studies, with the help of Satyajit Ray, in 1970 and remained its director till 1996. He taught in the film studies department of St Xavier’s College, Calcutta.He was the founder-director of the UGC’s Audio Visual Research Centre, which later became Electronic Multi Media Research Centre under St Xavier’s College, Calcutta.Father Roberge lived on the college campus and for the past few years had been in the infirmary for priests.“Father Roberge was a French-speaking Canadian from Montreal. He developed love, attraction and respect for India and its people since his formative years. He was highly impressed by Tagore’s Gitanjali and that might have been the reason for him to volunteer for India in general and Calcutta in particular as a young priest,” Father Dominic Savio, the principal of St Xavier’s College, said in his introductory address.He spoke of Father Roberge’s association with Satyajit Ray.“He watched Apu’s Trilogy on the eve of his maiden journey to Calcutta 60 years back and that had made an indelible impact on his mind… he had deep respect for Satyajit Ray…. He waited for many years to learn the Bengali language and get acquainted with the Bengali culture to have a meaningful discourse with Ray on hisfilms. He met Ray and became friends and author of books on the legendary filmmaker,” Father Savio said.Ghosh said Father Roberge was an “inspiring figure for filmmakers like us”. “He believed that you have to study cinema, learn cinema just like you learn a language and grammar. You have to know about great filmmakers and what they did.”",2020-08-09 04:26:00

They zeroed in on the phone’s location — a place in Nadia district. “We managed to get hold of the phone number of the youth’s father and contacted him in less than half an hour after receiving the mail from Facebook. His father was clueless and he immediately rushed to his son’s rescue,” a detective department officer said.After speaking to the youth’s father, the city police alerted Bhimpur police station in Nadia and sought their help in the rescue. The youth’s father, along with cops, broke open the door to his son’s room and found him unconscious. He was taken to a government hospital in Nadia where he was treated for “superficial” wounds.The youth’s family has apparently told cops he has been depressed for the past few years and that he had tried to kill himself in the past as well.",2020-08-09 04:33:00
1110,Mita Mukherjee,St Xavier’s College sets rules for exams - Telegraph India,"St Xavier’s College will conduct the final semester undergraduate and postgraduate exams. Students will have to write and upload answers within six hours of the start of the exam.Questions will be “analytical” that require original thinking of the students as they will not take the test sitting on the campus, Father Dominic Savio, the principal of St Xavier’s College, said.Question papers will be mailed to students half an hour before the start of the exam. The question papers will have an email address to which students will have to mail back the answers. The email addresses will vary from department to department to avoid disruption when too many students upload answers at the same time, a college official said.Students can key in answers or write them in A4 sheets. In case any student is unable to upload the answers because of Net connectivity problems, they can courier it to the college.The college had conducted a survey to find out how many students could find it difficult to take the exams for want of a smart device or because of poor Net connectivity. No student had complained of such problems, the official said.“The exams are for three hours; students will get another three hours to upload the answers in case they face connectivity problems on the day of examination,” the principal said.If students type in their answers on a word document, they will have to create a PDF, name it, attach it as a document, and mail it to the address provided in the question paper. If they use pen and paper, they will have to scan the pages “chronologically and sequentially” and convert the pages into a single PDF document and mail it, the principal said. The exams will carry 80 per cent as is the rule. The remaining 20 per cent is on internal assessments. The question pattern, though, will be different from the usual tests.
Multiple-choice questions have been included in all subjects, along with short and long-answer questions.    “Students will not write the exam on the campus. So, we have decided to bring in some changes in the question pattern. Questions will be set in such a way that they will demand original thinking and analytical ability of students,” Father Savio said.But the number of alternative questions will be much more this time. The alternative questions have been substantially increased, considering the stressful situation students are going through at present, the principal said.",2020-08-09 04:42:00
1111,Our Bureau,Covid: Work paucity cloud on death - Telegraph India,"A 24-year-old woman was found hanging in her rented accommodation in Jadavpur on Sunday.Police identified her as Bithi Mondal. Preliminary investigation suggested she had committed suicide, the police said.Mondal, who hailed from Joynagar in South 24-Parganas, did some modelling jobs and had enrolled in an air-hostess training course at a private academy, the police said.“She worked with a couple of event management companies. She was depressed as her work was not going well because of the pandemic,” an officer of Jadavpur police station quoted Mondal’s sister as saying.No suicide note has been found, the officer said.Mondal used to stay in a rented flat in Samajhgarh Park. “She was found hanging from the ceiling fan with a dupatta around 4pm on Sunday. The door was bolted from inside. She was declared dead at Baghajatin State General Hospital,” the officer said.An officer said investigations did not reveal any foul play. “No complaint has been received from anyone so far. A post-mortem will be conducted to ascertain the actual cause of her death.”The police have started a case of unnatural death.The pandemic has crippled livelihoods. Several companies have stopped spending on publicity. As a result, event management companies are hardly getting contracts.“Many struggling models and actors from districts share rented apartments in Calcutta. For starters, modelling is a low-paying job. The pandemic has only made things worse,” the owner of a Calcutta-based event management firm said. “Television shooting remained suspended for a long time.

1112,Subhankar Chowdhury,Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee airs NEP worry - Telegraph India,"The Centre should give priority to Covid-related matters during the pandemic instead of holding discussions to implement the National Education Policy, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Monday.The policy “tries to dilute the country’s federal structure”, Chatterje said after taking part in a virtual interaction on the policy with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind and Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal among others.“It maybe appreciated that in the current pandemic situation, Covid-related issues should get utmost priority.At a time Covid-19 is raging, they (Centre) are giving emphasis on discussing the National Education Policy,” he said.“But they are not giving any priority to how the spread of Covid-19 can be prevented. They are not giving any priority to how loss of lives can be prevented and the health of common people protected. This should have been discussed first. We have told the President it was high time that discussions were held on Covid-19.”The policy is centralised in nature although education comes under the concurrent list, minister Chatterjee said. “It tries to dilute the federal structure of the country, which is guaranteed in our Constitution, by trying to prescribe almost everything centrally.”Minister Chatterjee wondered whether the 6 per cent of the GDP would be adequate to meet the goals set in the pol-icy and said it was unclear how the fund sharing would take place.“There is no clarity on the issue of fund sharing,” Chatterjee said.A state government official said: “Until we manage to overcome the onslaught of Covid, we will not be left with enough resources to spend on this project. The Union government should be realistic.”Chatterjee said the Bengal government had “strong” reservations about the common test concept at the national level for admission to undergraduate courses, multi-layered undergraduate courses, and discontinuation of MPhil courses — some of the changes that have been enumerated under the policy.“We, therefore, request the Centre to provide us with appropriate time to present our complete views,” he said.Sugata Bose, the Gardiner professor of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University, had written in The Telegraph on August 17, describing the policy as a recipe for unenlightened over-centralisation.He wrote: “The announcement of the policy bypassing Parliament and any real consultation with the states is one more brazen and cynical attempt to advance the ruling configuration’s ideological agenda under the cover of Covid-19. It is a recipe for unenlightened over-centralisation.”An official of the higher education department said: “No one knows when the academic session will start. At a time like this, Covid-19 should be the first and only priority for any such interaction at a forum like this.”",2020-08-09 05:04:00
1113,Monalisa Chaudhuri,"Coronavirus outbreak: Fake news can land you in trouble, tweets Anuj Sharma - Telegraph India","The Calcutta police commissioner on Wednesday warned everyone against sharing or forwarding any social media message without properly verifying it.“Spreading #FakeNews can land you in trouble! Don’t forward any message/post on social media before properly verifying it,” top cop Anuj Sharma tweeted on Wednesday.In the past four months, police have arrested at least 50 people and summoned more than 100 for spreading fake news on social media.“People using social media should keep an eye on posts by others. In case they find anything offensive they should report it to the cyber cell or the detective department at Lalbazar,” Sharma told The Telegraph.The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday a study by health researchers in Bangladesh has identified India as the “topper” among five countries in spreading rumours and misleading information regarding the coronavirus on social media and online platforms.The other four countries in the top five are the US, China, Indonesia and Brazil. Rumours, stigma and conspiracy theories have circulated as infodemic waves between January and early April in these countries.The number of cases of “fake news” has gone up considerably after the outbreak of the pandemic, many officers said.“Half the cases (of fake news) are related to Covid-19. There have been several cases where information and incidents have been distorted to deliberately spread panic and unrest in society. At times the posts are unintentional, too,” an officer said.The police have come across cases where information about the body of a Covid-19 patient being dumped on the road by men wearing PPEs has been circulated on social media only to be found later that neither the patient had died of Covid-19 nor was the body dumped on the road, the officer said.Similar instances have been reported on social media where someone has posted the photograph and name of a person and identified him as a Covid-19 patient without any proof. This results in harassment of that person. A young woman was arrested in connection with this offence.A few weeks ago, a school teacher was arrested in New Alipore for posting false information that several people had tested positive for Covid-19 in some of the blocks in New Alipore, the police said. It had triggered panic among people in the neighbourhood.“Our social media cell has been keeping an eye on various social media platforms for necessary action. In most of the cases, it has been found that the person has circulated the information without realising it is false. In such cases we allow them to go after a warning,” an officer said.But in cases where it is found that a particular post has been circulated deliberately to spread communal tension, people involved are arrested, the officer added.",2020-08-13 02:32:00
1114,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus outbreak: Police stations told to ensure walkers’ safety - Telegraph India,"All police stations across the city have been asked to remain alert against snatchers, especially in the morning and the evening, when hundreds of Calcuttans step out for their daily dose of fresh air, officers said.Walking has turned out to be a popular work-out during the pandemic, as gyms were closed during the lockdown, and it has become more important to maintain vigil on parks and lakes where people usually gather for their daily walk.Anti-rowdy officers of the police stations have been asked to remain alert against criminals in their respective areas to ensure safety of morning and evening walkers. “Senior officers have observed that deployment is thin at lakes and parks, which are popular among walkers. So, all anti-rowdy officers have been asked to remain alert,” said an officer posted in the south-east division.The instructions came a day after a complaint of snatching was reported in north Calcutta on Tuesday morning.Hundreds of citizens are opting for morning or evening walk to stay fit during the pandemic.“I have been working from home for the last three months. The gym at my housing complex is yet to open. I was never an early riser. But now I have started jogging in the morning,” said Rahul Pramanik, a resident of south Calcutta who visits Rabindra Sarobar every morning.The night motorcycle patrol of every police station that has parks and lakes in its area is deployed on early morning duty at the walk spots. Cops are usually posted near lakes and parks between 5am and 7.30am.In the evening, at least two police cops of the rank of assistant sub-inspector and constable are entrusted with the security of walkers. 
Despite phases of unlocking, many roads are deserted because lack of customers prompts shopkeepers to down their shutters after sundown.“Earlier, I would take a walk at Vivekananda Park, off Southern Avenue, every evening. But these days the entire Southern Avenue is deserted in the evening. I no longer feel safe to walk in the evening. So, I now visit the park in the morning,” said Debojyoti Choudhury, a 67-year-old resident of Hindustan Park.Officers said elderly people were most vulnerable. “It is easy to trick them and rob them of their valuables,” an officer said.",2020-08-13 02:41:00
1115,"Kinsuk Basu , Subhajoy Roy","Coronavirus lockdown: Traders, in Burrabazar, count losses in thousands of crores as Covid crisis keeps customers away - Telegraph India","A nearly empty Kalakar Street or a handful of people in Phageya Patti on a weekday afternoon would seem unimaginable to a Burrabazar regular who has not visited the trading hub recently.Ask any trader from the area. He will say the ever busy and crowded lanes of Burrabazar have changed during the Covid-19 pandemic and the change is far from pleasant. In the pre-Covid days, Posta in Burrabazar would see a turnover of around Rs 100 crore a day. That has come down to around Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore, a trader said. The textile trade is barely 15 per cent of what it used to be around this time of the year, post-Janmashthami and in the run up to Durga Puja, said a member of the Chamber of Textile Trade and Industry (Cotti). Businesses are down, many shops are opening on alternate days, some are yet to open and customers are few and far between.“We have not seen anything like this. Burrabazar has never seen businesses remain so low for so long,” said a Pawan Hamirbasia, a textile trader who has a shop on Jamnalal Bajaj Street.Eastern India’s largest wholesale market, Burrabazar is a place where one can find almost anything under the sun. Garments, groceries, utensils, toys, paper products, spices, plastic items, use-and-throw cups and dishes, steel products, tarpaulin sheets, jewellery and what not. Almost all trades have been hit. Textile trader Mahendra Jain, the secretary of Cotti, said they had already suffered huge losses during two peak business periods, Id and the Bengali New Year. “It seems the scene will not improve drastically before Durga Puja and Diwali. Usually around this time, we start supplying to our customers, most of whom are retailers. We had no time to breathe. But there is hardly any customer this year,” said Jain. According to him, the textile trade in Burrabazar alone has suffered losses worth nearly Rs 10,000 crore in the four-and-a-half months since mid-March. What that part of Burrabazar is to garment wholesalers, Posta is to those dealing with grocery items. Pulses, oil, flour, wheat, jaggery, salt, masalas — around 1,000 shops are in almost 24X7 business selling grocery items.Trucks used to bring stuff from all parts of India at night. During the day, traders from across Bengal would flock to Posta to pick up their consignments. Not anymore. “Posta used to witness sales of around 600 tonnes of pulses a day. It has come down to around 50 tonnes a day,” said Chandan Chakrabarty, of Posta Bazar Byabsayee Samity. “The daily turnover at Posta was around Rs 100 crore a day before the pandemic. Now, it’s around Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore.”Barring a small number of traders, who have been doing business for decades with several crores of rupees in credit, most regulars have shied away from the hub amid the pandemic. Many traders said the demand for grocery items across Bengal had come down and medium-sized traders were not feeling the urge to turn up at Calcutta for refills.Retailers who would earlier turn up at Posta from district towns hiring Matadors and trucks have started establishing contacts with mills and factories in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for their supplies. Factories and mills from those states have started accepting smaller orders, something they did not do earlier. This has meant further loss for the wholesalers in Posta. Faced with the downturn, several traders in Posta have decided to keep their shops shut for days. “Dukan khulney sey koi faida nahin. Bazaar nahin hain (There is no point keeping shops open. There is hardly any demand),” said a pulses trader from Jagannath Ghat Cross Road in Posta.  After the lockdown was relaxed in June, most stores in Burrabazar started to open on alternate days. If one shop opened on Mondays, the one next to it would open on Tuesdays. Traders said they had made the arrangement to avoid crowding as a precaution against Covid-19. Another decision they took was that the shops would remain open from 11am to 4pm. “We had expected business to gain momentum with time and we would extend our hours. But nothing has changed and almost all shops in Burrabazar close by 5pm. Earlier, they would remain open till 7pm,” said a trader. The toy business, too, has been hit. Mohit Banthia, a wholesale trader of toys, said business was down by nearly 75 per cent. “We had a lot of customers from outside the state but not any more. I open my shop thrice a week. If the government imposes lockdown on one of those days, my earning takes a further hit,” he said.The dip in business means that the earnings of lakhs of people who work in the trade hub and are involved in allied services such as transportation and loading and unloading have been hit hard, too. The transport business, which thrived on ferrying stuff to districts or to other states in eastern India, is struggling, too. “A truck on an average is carrying 10 to 20 tonnes of goods, compared with its capacity to carry 50 tonnes. Orders from outside have dipped. Truck owners will not make any profit by carrying so little goods,” said one trader. Across Burrabazar, goods are unloaded from trucks from faraway places between 5am and 3pm. Even in early March, this would go on till 10pm. “Earlier, around 450 trucks would leave Burrabazar and Posta daily on an average. Now, barely 200 leave,” said Krishna Singh, a transporter.",2020-08-13 02:48:00
1116,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Indian Medical Association  gives a list of doctors to Calcutta police  - Telegraph India,"The Indian Medical Association has sent Calcutta police the names of doctors who can be contacted by officers at police stations if families of Covid-19 patients in home isolation need any medical help.Officers clarified that the families can approach the local police stations for any emergency related to any member, not just the Covid patients.The list has tagged two to four doctors with every police station. The doctors either live or work in the areas guarded by the respective police stations, said a member of the association.  Santanu Sen, the state president of the association, said the list of doctors was prepared after complaints emerged that the condition of some Covid patients in home isolation rapidly worsened between the time family members called the health department’s helpline for an ambulance and the arrival of the ambulance. The families panicked not knowing what to do and where to go. At a meeting held at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) last week, officials had discussed the problem faced by many families when a Covid-19 patient developed breathing trouble or other complications but had no confirmation when an ambulance would turn up to take the patient to hospital. “People should first call any of the health department’s numbers mentioned on its website for an ambulance. But an ambulance often takes some time to come. If the patient’s condition deteriorates meanwhile and the family approaches police, cops can call any of the doctors whose names are mentioned on the list and seek help,” said a senior state government official who was present at last week’s meeting at the CMC. A civic official said providing phone numbers of the doctors to the police stations was among several measures the government was taking to minimise hassles faced by families of Covid patients. The numbers of the doctors will not be displayed publicly and will only be available with police officers. “Police officers should exercise discretion and decide whether the condition of a Covid patient is such that the family should have a telephonic consultation with a doctor. There is a telemedicine helpline of the health department. So, officers should not call doctors whose numbers have been provided every now and then. It is only for emergencies,” said a member of the Indian Medical Association.The police can also call a doctor from the list if someone with fever fails to get a doctor’s appointment. There have been complaints that some doctors are refusing to see patients with fever. “In such a situation, an officer at a police station can call a doctor from the list with the request that he or she examine the fever patient,” the association member said.",2020-08-13 03:04:00
1117,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Bengal to ‘consider’ evacuation flights plea - Telegraph India,"The state government will “consider” a request from airlines to allow international evacuation flights to Calcutta so that thousands of people stuck around the world could return home, said officials.On Monday, representatives of various airlines held a meeting with the state government and Calcutta airport officials on the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for chartered flights from abroad, which the Bengal government has allowed. “At the meeting, the airlines requested the official representing the state government to allow evacuation flights from other countries to Calcutta. The official promised to consider the request,” said an airport official.On Wednesday, a state government official said they were considering the request and that they were going through the SOPs before deciding whether international evacuation flights could be allowed.“If the state government wants to impose stricter SOPs, we will accept that. The airlines that can meet the SOP demands will operate evacuation flights and others will not,” a representative of the airline operators committee at the Calcutta airport said. The state government, while allowing chartered flights from abroad, announced that only those who would test negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before departure would be allowed to board the aircraft. The agency hiring a chartered flight will have to ensure that all passengers follow the SOPs.Evacuation flights, operated by airlines, will have individual passengers booking tickets.The government had stopped such flights in July after hundreds of evacuees, many of them medical students, had refused institutional quarantine and gone home straight from the city airport.The Telegraph reported on Wednesday that travel agents’ federations had written to the state government urging it to allow evacuation flights. The airline operators’ committee made a similar appeal to the government during the day.“We appreciate the state government’s move to allow chartered flights. Now, if the evacuation flights are allowed, many who can’t afford to buy a seat on such chartered flights can get a chance to return home,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India. The tour operators and airlines have also requested the state to allow resumption of domestic flights from six cities with high Covid prevalence to Calcutta. All flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur had been banned on July 6 following a request from the state government. The ban was to end on August 15 but has been extended till August 31.",2020-08-13 03:18:00
1118,Our Special Correspondent,Kolkata weather report: Met spies wet Independence Day weekend - Telegraph India,"Independence Day weekend is likely to be rainy in the city.A low-pressure area is expected to form over the Bay of Bengal from Thursday, the Met office has said. Under its influence, there is likely to be a rise in rainfall in south Bengal between Friday and Sunday.The monsoon trough, passing over south Bengal, has been triggering rainfall in many places, including in Calcutta. The intensity is likely to go up because of the low-pressure system, the Met office has said.Several parts on the southern fringe of the city and South 24-Parganas received a sharp spell of rain on Wednesday afternoon.“The system is a cyclonic circulation on the north-west Bay of Bengal as of Wednesday and is expected to intensify into a low-pressure area on Thursday. The next three days are likely to see an increased amount of rainfall,” said G.K. Das, the director of the India Meteorological Department, Calcutta.“The rainfall could be heavy if the system is strong. But it is too early to predict. Things will become clearer on Thursday,” he said.August has so far received over 130mm of rain. The normal quota for the month is around 345mm.July ended with a marginal rain deficit in the city. Most of the showers over the month were because of local cloud formation. They were quick, sharp spells unlike slow and steady monsoon rain. A system over the Bay of Bengal — that could have dragged the monsoon trough down from the foothills of the Himalayas — was absent.A low-pressure system over the northern Bay of Bengal had been tipped to bring heavy rain in the city and the rest of south Bengal last week. Calcutta received 40mm of rain last Tuesday and around 25mm last Wednesday. Heavy rain, in Met parlance, is over 60mm in 24 hours. The system’s route was farther from the city than expected, the Met office had said.The monsoon trough is now passing over Santiniketan and Canning to the north-east Bay of Bengal, a Met official said.“If there are a couple of more such systems after this weekend, the August rain will be normal or above,” said the official.The cumulative volume of rain in the city so far — from June 1 to August 11 — has been over 850mm compared with the usual quote of around 800mm, the official said.",2020-08-13 03:26:00

Mohan Rao moving around the truck minutes before it left. This made the cops suspicious.He was arrested on August 10. Preliminary inquiry revealed Rao had planned the theft with the truck driver, its owner and others.“The truck left the Taratala godown on August 3. It crossed Vivekananda Setu and Dhulagarh to enter the Barrackpore area via the Nivedita Setu,” an officer said.The footage of CCTV cameras at the toll plazas on the truck’s route was scanned to track its movement.The goods were shifted to another truck at Madhyamgram and taken to a warehouse at Shibrampur, Maheshtala.

1121,Jayanta Basu,Green body glare on garbage - Telegraph India,"The National Green Tribunal has recently warned Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC), Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA), New Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) and the environment department of “civil imprisonment, withholding of the salary of concerned personnel, payment of penalty” if the agencies fail to comply its orders regarding waste management in East Calcutta Wetlands, an wetland of international repute. The order was passed on July 28 in response to a petition filed by environmentalist Subhas Datta in 2019, alleging illegal dumping of solid waste in Mollar Bheri over a long period within the wetlands area, seriously impacting the ecosystem. The wetlands are considered the kidneys of Calcutta and its fringe areas for their ability to naturally filter the waste water.   A senior BMC official admitted to the delay but claimed that they had been trying hard to comply with the tribunal directive.The tribunal pointed out that the action of the civic body was not adequate on the basis of its submitted affidavit while pointing out that the NDITA, the NKDA and the environment department had not even submitted the affidavit despite the tribunal’s order. Petitioner Datta earlier pointed out with photographic evidence that all these agencies failed to protect the wetland area from waste contamination.“We have noted the action taken by the BMC… however we do not find the actions to be adequate in terms of its speed and no tangible result found tangible,” observed the principal bench of the tribunal constituted of Justice S.P. Wangdi and expert member Nagin Nanda.The bench also pointed out that the civic body had failed to stick to the timeline fixed by itself regarding proper solid waste management, including removal of legacy waste besides the Mollar Bheri (wetlands) located within East Calcutta Wetlands where Salt Lake and fringe urban local bodies have been disposing solid waste for a number of years.A Calcutta high court directive in the early 1990s prohibited the change of land use character in the East Calcutta Wetlands. The Ramsar ratification in the early 2000s came as a formal acknowledgement of its status as a wetlands of international importance; and finally the 2016 wetlands norms of the union government bar any change of land use within the wetlands including disposal of solid waste.Datta complained that the waste and its run off have been polluting the wetlands which, apart from impacting the wetland ecology, also affects the livelihoods of thousands depending on the ecosystem.During the last hearing on video, the bench expressed displeasure that its earlier orders have not been carried out by BMC, along with NDITA, NKDA and state environment department; the last three, according to the bench, did not even submit the affidavit.“We make it clear that failure to comply with the direction even during the extended period shall entail issuance of coercive orders which would include civil imprisonment, withholding of the salary of concerned personnel, payment of penalty, environmental compensation etc,” reads the order. “Our first two tenders about removing the legacy waste from Mollar Bheri have to be cancelled and now we are in process of a third tender which will be opened in mid-August,” said Debasish Ghosh, commissioner of BMC. Ghosh however claimed that they were now disposing of the waste in Dhapa and also shared that the process of shifting the legacy waste to the Dhapa area had started following the norm of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.The next hearing is listed on September 14.",2020-08-14 00:12:00
1122,Brinda Sarkar,Flag sales drop - Telegraph India,"Not many shops in the twin townships will be decked up with Tricolour flags and badges this week. Like everything else, the pandemic has taken a toll on the Independence Day shopping list.“Remember how hawkers would run up to cars at traffic signals and sell miniature flags around August 15? They are selling masks now,” says Sarman Pandit of Modern Decoration Centre in CA Market. “These small time hawkers would buy flags from us before but this year none of them have showed up.”Students Corner, a stationery shop in GD Market, will not have a single Tricolour flag, badge or wristband on sale this year. “I am unwell and I don’t have the manpower to go buy these memorabilia from Burrabazar. Other stationery items are delivered to us by companies but such seasonal products have to be picked up in person,” says Bappa Sarkar, who runs the store. Another stationery shop in GD Market — Loknath Stores — has some paper printouts of the tricolour and table flags. “One or two customers have asked for flags on straws — that cost Rs 3 to 5 — but that’s it,” says Ajit Kundu. “Neither is there demand this year nor do we have much to offer.” Sri Guru Bhandar in IA Market will display flags, badges and tricolour wristbands from today. “But we haven’t bought anything afresh. We are simply selling leftovers from last year,” says Rishiraj Ghosh, who runs the store. “In other years, nearby hotels and hospitals would come buy merchandise to decorate their premises but this year one can hardly expect them. The bulk of buyers would be students using the items for programmes at school. Even that won’t be happening this year.”Nonetheless they are stocked with Rs 10 badges of India’s flag and map and Rs 10 synthetic wrist bands. The price of cotton flags begins from Rs 25 and the largest 6ft silk flags cost Rs 220. IA Market traders will themselves be hoisting the Tricolour on Saturday with a flag from this store.At New Town Gift Gallery in Eden Shop, Nasirul Islam says they have about 10 per cent stock of what they had last year. “And it is all last year’s leftovers taken out of cold storage. Students and offices from the nearby DLF building would be our main customers but now schools are shut and offices are operating from home so we haven’t bought anything new,” says Islam. Prasenjit Pal had gone to Needs, a miscellaneous store in Baisakhi, to buy drawing books for his three-year-old when he got attracted to an inflatable Tricolour. “My son has an online Independence Day programme from his playschool this year. They haven’t really asked him to get any flags but this inflatable one looks cute and I’m taking one home for him.”The Baisakhi store has a good collection of Independence Day merchandise — ribbons, paper hats with ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ written, paper flags, badges…. “We have the works but sales are low,” Nitai Chandra Debnath shakes his head. “In other years, customers buy big flags as well as small ones to place in cars and on bikes. This year the saving grace is this inflatable flag that is a novelty and hence being picked up by some. It costs between Rs 30 and 40.”Srimaa, a clothing store in CK Market, has a mannequin with a tricolour sash over a kurta. “We went and bought 30 to 40 such satin scarves before Independence Day. They are quite popular for dances and other stage programmes and even if they don’t sell this week, I’m sure they will sell off and on around the year,” says Tamosha Mukherjee. The scarves cost Rs 50.Even though retails sales may be modest, Modern Decoration Centre in CA Market says they have been contacted by offices in New Town to decorate their premises. “We shall do so with tricolour balloons, ribbons and flags. We’ve got to make the best of the situation.”",2020-08-14 00:15:00
1123,,Medieval traditions unite Bengal and Scotland - Telegraph India,"In the medieval societies of Bengal and Scotland, kings and priestly classes developed a way of recording transfer of property ownership in strikingly parallel terms using related vocabulary and philosophical concepts.In Bengal, land gifts were recorded in Sanskrit etched in copper plates and stone inscriptions. In Scotland, it was recorded in charter parchments in Latin. In both societies, it was the king who made the donations of land to the priestly class.John Reuben Davies, a research scholar at Glasgow University, came to Calcutta in 2011 and was surprised to find in Asiatic Society copper plates from the Pala era in Bengal (10th to 12th century CE) that had close similarities with parchment charters from Scotland belonging to the same period. Charters are written records of transfer of property.While the copper plates had the Sanskrit word “danam” inscribed in them, the parchment charters bear the word “donum” in Latin. Both of giving as a gift is ‘danam’. Latin, the same Indo-European root, provides the noun ‘donum’, a gift, indicate a gift of land from the king to the priestly class for eternity.“In Sanskrit, the word for the method and the verb ‘dono’, I give as a gift,” said Davies.“The concept of transferring ownership of property by giving as a gift is at the heart of property records both from Bengal and Scotland. And both in Bengal and Scotland, a word that has the same origin in Sanskrit and Latin was used to describe the transaction and give it legal force. So in two early medieval societies, 6,000 miles apart with no known contemporary connections or influences, had evolved an almost exactly similar way of recording transfer of property in strikingly parallel terms and using directly related vocabulary and philosophical concepts.”Davies made the statement during a recent online lecture as part of the Stories of World Culture, an Indian Museum’s virtual initiative during the pandemic.Davies and retired Calcutta University professor Swapna Bhattacharya, who has worked on Indian copper plates and European charters, collaborated and co-edited a book on these findings, Copper, Parchment and Stone: Studies in the Sources of Land Holding and Lordship in Early Medieval Bengal and Medieval Scotland, published by the Centre of Scottish and Celtic Studies of Glasgow University.Glasgow University has decided to include the findings of Davies and Bhattacharya in the first-year undergraduate and postgraduate syllabus. Classes on the topic will start next year.Regarding its inclusion in the history course, Joanna Tucker, a history lecturer at Glasgow University, said in a WhatsApp message to Metro: “The digitisation of texts and the surge in availability of digital resources have partly (and paradoxically) led to a new appreciation of the ‘physicality’ of our manuscript sources…. One recent publication (Davies, 2019) compares Indian and Scottish gifts of property in parchment charters and in copper and stone inscriptions. This provides a way to show our students that recent work in the field of medieval Scottish history has been taking a global perspective….”Davies found further similarities like properties could be owned outright forever. A very similar conceptual, linguistic and textual framework evolved to guarantee the conveyance and ownership of property. The king was the supreme authenticating authority, provided he is the legitimate heir proved by the publication of his genealogy in copper, stone or parchments that he could govern and guarantee the rights of his subjects.",2020-08-14 03:50:00

Till last year, an applicant had to pay separately for each course, a department official said. “Now, be it a single application or multiple applications, a college cannot charge the candidate.”Candidates cannot be charged for applying in multiple colleges as well, the official said.While submitting applications, candidates visit cyber cafes to get their Plus II mark sheets and other documents scanned. Cafe operators charge them for the service. By saying no applicant can be charged for scanning/uploading documents, the department has advised colleges to develop facilities to offer such services free, another official said.“This year the state joint examinations board has created 17,000 common service centres to help BTech aspirants take part in online counselling free. Colleges can approach the board so that undergraduate aspirants can use these centres to upload their documents free of cost,” he said.The decision has been taken in view of the hardship students and their families are going through during the pandemic, education minister Partha Chatterjee said.Colleges have been outsourcing their admission portals to various agencies since the government introduced the online admission system in 2016.From receiving applications and offering payment gateways for services to accepting documents and preparing the merit list, everything is done by these agencies.Whatever colleges earn by way of application fees and uploading documents, a part of it is shared with the agencies, a principal said.Those who have already applied will now seek a refund, another principal said.The department had on July 16 issued the notification to start the undergraduate admission process.“Calcutta University had uploaded the admission notification on July 24 but hadn’t said anything on the fees,” a principal said. “We have to pay the agency that is managing the admission portal. The department should support us as it has waived the fees.”“Let the colleges appeal. We will then take the call,” a department official said.",2020-08-14 04:15:00
1126,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Kolkata teens fight cyber sexual peril - Telegraph India," A group of students has started an online campaign to create awareness against trafficking and to stand up for human rights at a time when traditional ways of trafficking is going the online way.The students, from Classes IX to XII, have undergone a three-week training by NGO International Justice Mission, Calcutta, to encourage youngsters to speak up against human trafficking. The idea is to reach students through their peers at a time when the pandemic has forced every activity to be online and “spotters” are using the cyber space to track and trap students online and solicit sexual services for clients.The student leadership programme was held for four students each from La Martiniere for Girls, St Xavier’s Collegiate School, The Heritage School, Delhi Public School Megacity, South City International School, Sri Sri Academy and The Newtown School.Trafficking and child sexual abuse is not limited to those from slums or the lower-end of society, an official of the NGO said. Even children from the upper middle class or higher social strata or from broken families are vulnerable targets, the official said.“We have to tell kids about the dangers. Children are unaware of these dangers and the social protection they have in schools or at homes is not there in the online space,” Sisir Thanikal, the NGO’s community engagement head, said. “So, we need to talk about it freely… that anybody and everybody is vulnerable and has to be careful.”The perpetrators have adapted themselves to the online space, Thanikal said. “They enter platforms or groups of youngsters and befriend them with a false identity and seek salacious videos or photographs and blackmail them with those. They are generally asked to enter a private group online and perform or links are sent to clients and perpetrators get paid.”Students get to know of the dangers of the online world through value education classes but it is more acceptable when it comes from their peers, Rupkatha Sarkar, the head of La Martiniere for Girls, said.“In the current times when students are using the Net prolifically they must be aware of cyber security and bullying and of the kind of networking that happens online and that they can become victims unknowingly,” Sarkar said. “They need to know whom to befriend on the Net, the limits they need to set and how much exposure they can allow.”Young students take this online world to be real but it is filled with people with fake identities. “The perpetrators make students feel comfortable and win their confidence so that they share videos of themselves. Often, students are trapped online because they are misled by romance and excitement,” Agnes Toppo, the NGO’s senior coordinator for community engagement, said. “The current trend has shifted online with most young people holding a social media account.”",2020-08-14 04:22:00
1127,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Kolkata cancer hospital issues appeal for blood - Telegraph India,"The Thakurpukur cancer hospital has appealed for blood saying the country is “not as Independent” as it was last year and people should come forward to help fellow citizens with blood.Hospitals like the one in Thakurpukur are suffering from severe shortage of blood because of the Covid pandemic. People are wary of donating blood in this situation and camps are few because of the distancing norms announced as a precaution against Covid-19. As a result, many blood banks are running dry.Arnab Gupta, the director of Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre & Research Institute, in Thakurpukur, made a social media post on Wednesday: “As we approach Independence Day, we realise that we are not as Independent as were last year. Along with the Corona pandemic where many people have fallen victims, what we are now seeing all over Bengal and many parts of India, is the severe scarcity of blood. We would request you to kindly come forward and save your fellow countrymen, especially children by donating blood. Many are afflicted with cancer, thalassaemia and now dengue. You may contact any local blood bank/hospital. That’s the best way to pay tribute to our freedom fight-ers and to Mother India….Of course one has to be fit to donate.”The blood crisis at his institute is delaying cancer treatment, Gupta told The Telegraph.The hospital caters to many underprivileged people, including children, who are treated at reduced costs or the hospital arranges for funds for them through sponsors to make treatment available to them.Many of the patients come from districts and it is even more difficult for them to arrange for blood.“Our average monthly blood collection used to be 600 units before the lockdown, which could just meet our requirements. Now the collection is less than 200 units per month, resulting in a huge shortfall. Availability in other blood banks is scarce, too,” said Gupta.The reserves are constantly depleting and on Thursday, the institute had just seven units of B-positive and two units of A-positive in its blood bank.This newspaper had on Monday reported that a sharp drop in the number of blood donation camps because of the Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in a crisis in availability of blood in Calcutta as well as the rest of Bengal.Last Sunday, long queues were seen in front of counters of several blood banks in the city. Most people in the queues were told by blood bank officials that there was no guarantee they would get blood even after waiting for hours.Ever since the pandemic started, the number of blood donation camps has been decreasing. The situation worsened as time passed, according to officials of multiple blood banks. Blood bank officials say almost all banks are supplying blood only if those in need bring donors.Gupta said that in the Thakurpukur hospital, the blood was separated into three components — RBC, platelet and plasma. The treatment in the hospital, he said, includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.“For any major cancer surgery, we need to have a back-up of blood, in the absence of which treatment is being postponed. Blood parameters have to be corrected for anybody who has low haemoglobin and low platelet for any further treatment. And blood is required for that,” said Gupta. “Children with blood cancer are more susceptible because there is a chance of internal bleeding with low platelet count,” he said.Gupta suggested that blood donation camps could be organised with small groups of people and by maintaining the distancing norms.",2020-08-14 04:29:00
1128,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Cat goes missing from home in Alipore - Telegraph India,"Max, the Maine Coon, from Alipore has left home and maybe moving around with cats beneath his status.The cat, one of the largest domesticated species in the world, has not returned home in the past week and its owners have launched a search on social media.The two-and-a-half year-old was last heard responding to a mating call on Friday night when his owners thought he was still inside their Alipore Road bungalow. It was only in the morning when Max did not turn up for breakfast, Sonali Lakhotia realised he was missing.“My husband and I were watching TV in our room when we last heard Max responding to a mating call. You cannot miss his baritone meow. I had thought like other days, he must be somewhere inside the house,” Sonali said.The next morning, when Max did not make his mandatory appearance at her room where he would usually cry trying to grab her attention towards his breakfast time, she realised he was missing.Nothing has been the same for Sonali and her family since then. Her daughter Mahi, 10, and son Viraj, 8, consider the cat their friend.Main Coon is a domesticated breed known for their size and elegance, Max’s vet Aparajita Chakraborty Roy said. “They are big house cats with no wild streaks in them. They are extremely friendly and would get into anyone’s lap without any protest. They are equally majestic, too, and their body language will make it clear they are loyal to their owners.”Max, however, is “rare,” she said.Unlike other male cats that usually lack the protective instinct for kittens, Max had rescued a stray kitten and brought him home. The Lakhotias have adopted him, too, and named him Chewy.Max spends a considerable time of the day sleeping. He is most active in the afternoon when he strolls out in the lawn and lazes under the trees or at times even walks outside the bungalow.The past one-and-a-half month has been different, though. “We were worried about the infection spreading through animals. So, we decided to restrict his movements inside the bungalow. He was not allowed to step out on the lawn. At times we took him out for a walk, just like a pet dog,” Sonali said.Sonali and husband Sidharth have been looking around for Max in the neighbourhood without any result. The family has posted an emotional appeal on social media with Max’s photograph, requesting people to report if they spot him.Max, who had pancreatic problems, has only hepatic diet. The fact he will not eat anything else outside has left the Lakhotias more worried.“Domestic cats take a long time to adjust to new surroundings. Even if someone has taken Max, he will not be able to adjust to the new home. He will stop eating and drinking water. It will lead to gradual dehydration and gas formation in his stomach and may trigger health issues,” Max’s vet Chakraborty Roy said.The family had adopted two-month-old Max after losing two Labradors and a cat in a row years ago. “We can just request people to return him. He is too docile to even protest if someone overpowered him. Whenever he picked fights with stray cats, he invariably returned home scratched. He doesn’t stand a chance for resistance. Please return him,” Sonali appealed through Metro.The lockdown and the scare of Covid-19 have hit pets, too.A few weeks ago, Shabby, a Labrador, had slipped out of the window of her owner’s car when she was taken out for a ride after weeks of confinement at their Phoolbagan home. She was found with the help of police.",2020-08-14 04:39:00
1129,Mita Mukherjee,NUJS students seek fee relief - Telegraph India,"Students of the National University of Juridical Sciences have appealed to the authorities to waive some fees because they are attending online classes and not using some of the facilities.The students have demanded reduction of fees for the July-December semester to be charged for exams, students’ welfare, moot courts, hostel and study materials, an official of the law school said.A fourth-year student said the fee for the current semester of his batch was around Rs 1.6 lakh. A student of the batch will have to pay around Rs 46,000 less if the authorities accept the demand.“Almost every student is facing a financial crisis because of the pandemic. Reduction of Rs 46,000 will be of great relief to us,” the fourth-year student said.“If the students’ demands are accepted, the fees for the current semester will reduce by Rs 46,000 to Rs 51,000, depending on the batches,” an official said.Vice-chancellor N.K. Chakrabarti said: “The appeal is under consideration. The matter will be placed in the next meeting of the executive council (August 22). We will be in a position to say whether the fees can be reduced or not after the meeting.”An official said the authorities were in favour of granting relief to the students. “But all their demands cannot be accepted. The entire hostel fee can’t be waived off. The hostels are closed but each employee is being paid the full salary.”The authorities plan to offer uniform relief to all batches, the official said. “As of now there is no plan to offer any relief to the incoming batch,” he said.The institute’s five-year LLB course costs around Rs 15 lakh, including tuition, hostel and other fees, according to the existing fee structure.",2020-08-14 04:44:00
1130,Subhankar Chowdhury,Presidency University seal on entry norm - Telegraph India,"Presidency University this year will admit students based on their board marks, the admissions committee of the institute decided on Thursday.The committee decided that the merit lists for all subjects, except statistics and economics, would be prepared based on marks in the Class X and Class XII board exams, an official said. Students aspiring to study economics and statistics honours will be admitted based on their plus-II board marks.“Due to the prevailing COVID-19 impacted situation, difficulties in conducting an admission test were discussed…. All members unanimously decided to prepare a merit list... based on marks obtained by a candidate in her/his Madhyamik/equivalent (10th standard) and Higher Secondary/ equivalent (10+2 standard) examinations,” reads a resolution of the admissions committee.Registrar Debajyoti Konar said the eligibility criteria would be announced soon. Vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia said they wanted to keep as many screening layers as possible. “The teachers had proposed that the secondary exams marks be considered,” Lohia said.For physics honours, the marks in math and the average marks in physical science and life science in Madhyamik or marks in the science group in equivalent exams will be added to the aggregate and the marks in math in the plus-II exams. For chemistry honours, the average marks of physical science and life science in Madhyamik or marks in the science group in equivalent exams will be added to the marks in chemistry, math and English in the plus-II exams.The Bengal HS council could not hold tests in physics and chemistry because of the pandemic. Each student had the best marks in the other papers awarded to the two.",2020-08-14 04:50:00
1131,The Telegraph,Freedom from coronavirus - Telegraph India,"Gopi AgarwalHow I got it: I have no idea. Mine was the first case in Salt Lake but no one I had interacted with got Covid around that time.Family status: No one else at home got sick, but my son, driver and cook were sent to New Town’s quarantine centre as a precaution. My daughter has had a major surgery so she was allowed to stay home, along with my wife.My Covid battle: I got fever on the evening of junta curfew, on March 22. I took medicines but started maintaining a distance from my family members, just in case. When my fever persisted even after a week, my doctor asked me to get admitted to a hospital and get tested for Covid.My stay at the hospital was a stay in hell. Doctors and nurses never came close to me. They would enquire my health standing at the door. Only one person came to collect blood samples and he was so inexperienced that my blood wouldspill on the floor. Still I was charged Rs 1,20,000 for PPEs.I had to scream and shout before they gave me fresh clothes, the room had no TV, they didn’t let me keep my phone and I had no access to a toilet. I was asked to squat on the floor and use the bed pan as a toilet! The food quality was so poor that I lost 15kg in my week’s stay there.But at the time this was the only nearby hospital that was admitting Covid patients and I had no choice.What’s most insensitive is that a WhatsApp message had started doing the rounds in the middle that I had passed away. Relatives had started calling up my wife to console her.Current condition: I’m fine now and have resumed going to my factory. Since my recovery, over a 100 people have called me for Covid-related advice. I pulled through but there are many others who are in a worse state than me. I have also made a donation to the councillor to help Covid warriors.Manasi BhaktaHow I got it: Probably from my husband, Dibakar. He was a kidney patient and needed hospitalisation. On the morning of June 22, I set off in an ambulance, with his head on my lap, only to be refused by five or six hospitals. His condition was critical but every place asked us to show his Covid report first.At 8pm, a government hospital took him in and collected his swab samples. But it was too late. My husband died in two hours. The next day his Covid report arrived. It was positive.Family status: I sat on the staircase of the hospital the whole night, crying, all alone. My daughter is in college, son in Class VI. I couldn’t muster the courage to tell them what had happened. I told relatives but not one of them came over, scared of getting infected. The cops posted around the hospital hailed a taxi for me in the morning to go home.Soon my daughter and I tested positive. We had to be hospitalised. My son tested negative but no relatives agreed to shelter him. He was sent to a quarantine home.My Covid battle: I would inhale as hard as I could but it still felt like the oxygen wasn’t going in. My throat felt like there was cough clogging it and any form of movement would drain all the energy out of me. It took me two weeks to recover.Current condition: Health-wise I am better but Covid has pushed me into a lot of difficulties. I used to be a homemaker who barely left the house but I now have to find a source of income, manage the home and raise the children. So scared are our relatives that they still haven’t come to meet us. Some have got Covid themselves now and are calling me up for advice. Still, the situation is teaching me to be strong. My husband was a poet and two of his books have gone to print now. I’m waiting for them to release.Ranjit ChakrabortyGot it from: I don’t know but it all started when a 95-year-old resident, who broke his leg after a fall, was rushed to the hospital and tested positive. He died of a heart attack the next day but Kuntala Patnaik, president of Saptadweepa, the NGO that runs the home, got the health department to conduct tests for all 43 of us at Bairag and Pushparghya, their second home at HB Block. I tested positive.Family status: Ten residents of our homes tested positive and we were shocked. None of us had been going out.
I, along with another male boarder were moved to New Town’s Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) immediately. Another lady and a 90-year-old man were coming the next day but the man expired in the car itself. Our home has single rooms with attached bathrooms so the other six boarders stayed back. They weren’t keen on moving to a different facility.My Covid battle: We have been hearing horror stories of other hospitals but CNCI was so good that I got half-cured just entering the compound. It was cleaner than one’s house, doctors and nursing staff were caring and checked our parameters whenever we asked. Food was good and we were allowed to keep our mobile phones. Some staff members even went and bought toiletries for us when we requested them to.The lady from our home was very scared — both at having contracted Covid and at being in a new place. I asked the patient in her neighbouring bed to ensure she ate her meals.Current condition: I recovered after a week and have resumed normal life. I’m not going out.Sourav MundhraHow I got it: Cannot trace the sourceFamily status: I got fever but my doctor said it was viral. Nonetheless they were organising a Covid test in CK-CL community hall and so my father and I decided to get tested.When both of us tested positive we decided to get everyone at home tested. Out of the 11 family members and one staff at home tested, eight had Covid.My Covid battle: Those of us who got infected stayed on the second floor of our house and the rest stayed on the ground floor. Besides a member of staff, this comprised my two sisters (one of whom is in school) and my nine-month old daughter. Our eight-year-old son was upstairs with us. My wife and I were both in quarantine upstairs and we were worried about how the baby would manage without her mother but my sisters took up the responsibility and she had no problem.Food was being sent by relatives, received by the ground floor folks and our share was being left upstairs for us to receive. We washed our own utensils and clothes.The quarantine period would have been difficult to spend had I been alone but with seven people around it was life as usual. We spent time praying, singing bhajans, doing yoga, cleaning the house, on our phones and TV sets and looking after one another. We ate a lot of fresh fruits, inhaled steam and gurgled to prevent our condition from aggravating. The elderly members of my joint family have co-morbidities but luckily, we only had mild symptoms.Almost every day I would wake up to phone calls from panicked friends and relatives asking about the virus. I kept telling them to get tested if they felt they had symptoms so treatment could start before it was too late. Our doctor had a big role in calming us down too. One needs much mental support at a time like this.Current condition: We stayed in quarantine for 20 days before leaving the house. Now all are fine.Neha SharmaHow I got it: Both my husband and I were attending office. Though my office — the Liluah workshop of the Eastern Railways — is in a highly affected area, I suspect I caught the virus from my husband Dhritiman Sarkar. Being with the Bidhannagar Commissionerate, he was on duty at the airport during the Vande Bharat mission. On one occasion, there was a brawl and he had to contain unruly passengers. Within two days of the incident, he was down with fever.Family status: Husband and security guard tested positive as well.My Covid battle: The first few days after my husband got fever, I was going to office and he was resting at home. But after a couple of days, I too developed sudden chill and cough. On July 3, three of us went for tests at Apollo hospital. I was unable to even sit by then. Once we tested positive, we received a call from NKDA. Since all of us were within 32 years of age, we opted for home isolation. We were prescribed a course of antibiotics and vitamins. Our temperature veered around 100F. On the third or fourth day, we lost the sense of taste and smell. Along with cough, I also experienced some breathing discomfort, neither of which my husband did. I kept checking my SpO2 on a pulse oximeter, doing breathing exercises and taking cough syrup. All through, our security guard and I were cooking at home while a policeman deposited the supplies we needed with the complex guard downstairs. Sometimes we ordered outside food when we needed a break. After four days, we stopped taking Paracetamol to check if the fever would relapse. It did not. Though according to the current medical protocol, testing is not needed once 14 days are over, we still went for tests. This time, I was the only one who came positive. Though I was told it was likely to be a false positive, I still took a re-test after three days, on July 22. This time it was negative.Current condition: I rejoined work on July 27.Ankit NahataHow I got it: My father had a heart attack on May 23 and had to be hospitalised for angioplasty. He had to be taken for check-up on June 3. I got infected either that day or on June 6, when we had a family gathering.
Family status: Six out of our family of seven got infected. Only my mother tested negative.My Covid battle: On June 7, my father had fever. The doctor insisted on a Covid test. He could not believe when the report came positive as there was no case yet in either Rosedale or Uniworld City opposite us. He had to be hospitalised because of his health condition. The rest of us — my wife, brother, his wife and their one-and- half year old daughter- stayed home.Our apartment was sealed. We had mild fever. We received a lot of help from our residents’ association. We just had to call the facility manager to get what we needed. We gurgled with turmeric powder and drank hot milk with turmeric powder to boost immunity. Arnab Roy, the NKDA doctor, helped us a lot as did our house physician Amit Dey. A relative gave us a kada, which was a solvent to relax the throat. On June 23, my father came back from hospital. Our association staff members greeted us with flowers on July 2 when our period of isolation ended.Current condition: I am back to work. Last week, I donated plasma at Calcutta Medical College. I was told I was only the 25th person to volunteer this. They did a range of screening tests, including the Covid antibody test and asked me to come again after a week. It felt good to do this. Even now, I am asked by NKDA health team to call up and speak to Covid patients, which I happily do.Debanjan KunduHow I got it: I was on duty in the radiation oncology department of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. I must have got exposed there.Family status: My mother tested negative.My Covid battle: In the first week of July, I developed headache, fever and body ache. There was no respiratory distress. After four or five days, I lost sense of taste and smell. That persisted for three to four weeks. Once I received the report by email, I isolated myself at home for 17 days after giving an undertaking to the local authorities. An NKDA team disinfected the house. Fear was there as one’s condition can deteriorate quickly. This is not like influenza in that even mild Covid-19 can be severe. The kind of lethargy and weakness it causes is unlike in any viral illness. Our complex had a protocol in place in case a resident tested positive. That protocol was put in place and we had no trouble sourcing groceries and medicines.Current condition: I came out of isolation on the third week of July and joined duty at the hospital on the same day. I am back to full strength now. I have also volunteered to help at the Covid care centre that my apartment complex has created for residents who are unable to self-isolate at home. Of course, there is still risk of infection in future.Nazish Pervez KhanHow I got it: Probably from my husband. He runs a medicine shop and got fever. But he recovered in three days.
Family status: After my husband, next was my daughter and then son but they all recovered in two or three days. I have diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma. When I got fever, it persisted for eight days.My Covid battle: The doctor we consult wasn’t willing to check fever patients but he agreed to meet me over video call. He prescribed tests for malaria, dengue and the like but I asked him to add Covid to the list.I wasn’t scared of getting Covid. What I was scared of is the treatment I may get at the hospital. We have a relative who was admitted at a top hospital in the early days of Covid’s spreading. He was on the ventilator and was footing bills of Rs 1 lakh a day but the nurses were throwing medicines at him for fear of contracted Covid themselves.Once my report came out, I was moved to a nursing home as far off as Kidderpore as we had heard service was compassionate. And it was. I was put on oxygen immediately and it continued for the next nine days.I have never felt so sick in my life and thought I would die. I am very religious and offered namaz even with my oxygen mask on but on some days I would be so out of breath I couldn’t even utter the prayer. I didn’t want to use a bed pan as I wanted to be clean for namaz and would insist that the nurses escort me to the toilet. On one such day, I fainted.  Current condition: I was in quarantine for some days even after coming home. I would stay in a room and my food would be kept outside. Now I am better.Amal Kumar MaitiHow I got it: I had gone to my brother’s house in New Town for some work where an associate had come. The next day that person got fever and the day after, I fell sick.Family status: My wife and elder daughter, who has come from Bangalore for the lockdown, tested positive. My younger daughter, school-going son and domestic help were spared.My Covid battle: Initially the three of us who tested positive were living separately from the others within our flat. While my wife and daughter recovered fairly easily, my fever persisted. Doctors advised tests but no pathology lab would agree to run tests for a Covid patient. My younger daughter Pallabi learnt from her doctor friends that AMRI Hospital has tied up with Monotel and that patients with mild symptoms staying at the Sector V hotel would have their tests done from the hospital.
My wife and I checked in for about a week. While hotels usually mean a relaxed holiday, this experience was a new one. An entire floor there was dedicated to Covid patients and a nurse, who had a room there and checked our parameters thrice a day. Doctors came for rounds too.Current condition: Though weak, we have all recovered and I plan to join work soon. The doctor has asked us to exercise by walking on the terrace to maintain immunity.Jaydeb RayHow I got it: I am a doctor at Calcutta National Medical College & Hospital. In fact, I’m an anaesthetist and my work involves touching the mouths and faces of patients. However, I was careful and none of my patients had tested positive.
The other possibility was a fish market near the “loha pool” bridge between New Town and Sector V that I would visit. But no one at the market got Covid either.Family status: My daughters were looking after me but luckily, they tested negative.My Covid battle: Being a doctor I thought I had an understanding of Covid-19 but the experience was worse than I could imagine. It began with fever that lasted eight days. I was weak and couldn’t sleep a wink at night. I even blacked out once and had a fall while returning from the washroom.The hospital I work at is not handling Covid patients so I went to another private hospital to get tested and then shifted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata.The environment in a Covid hospital is not for the weak-hearted. You’re shunned to a corner, no one comes to you, food is kept on a trolley at the door... I never even saw a nurse’s face and junior doctors would maintain a distance of about five feet from me. Only one senior doctor would come up close and we build a rapport.My strength was down to zero and the only thing that kept me going was mental strength. No drug can work like will power and that is what one needs to recover from Covid.Current condition: I lost 10kg in those 14 days. Now my trousers cannot be worn without belts and my colleagues at the hospital cannot recognise me! I joined work in end-June and am mostly on tele-medicine duty now.Subhajit SarkarHow I got it: The irony is that I was in China, working and meeting people, when Covid-19 was peaking there and had emerged unscathed. Months later, I got sick here in India where I was maintaining lockdown.
In the four months here, I left the house only seven times, that too with face shield and N95 mask. We didn’t socialise with anyone outside, would sanitise the house almost to a level of paranoia… I am in the merchant navy and had to undergo a medical test before joining duty. That was when I tested positive.Family status: I live with my wife and baby, who sticks to me like a magnet all the time. It’s very lucky that she, or anyone else, didn’t get it.My Covid battle: NKDA called me and gave me the option of institutional quarantine at the expense of the government but I chose to stay home, in a room with an attached bath. I have two paramedical licences — from Indian and the European Union and am also the medical officer on board my ship —so I knew I could handle it.I had mild symptoms — only headache and a bad stomach, but then the latter may have been from over-eating! My wife Olga is Ukrainian but she makes delicious Indian food. She would serve me lots, thinking it would improve my immunity and I would try to down it all as all my leftovers would have to be dumped in the biohazard bin otherwise.Olga has a medical condition due to which she can’t go out alone. Luckily two friends brought us groceries.Isolation was no big deal for me as I’m used to it on the ship. I watched movies, worked out, looked out of the window…the toughest part was staying positive. Covid is now the most feared disease after cancer. People would call me up every day, asking if I had got fever. It was as if they were waiting for me to get sick. Such conversations end up scaring you more.I wouldn’t pray much before this but when I got Covid, I prayed.Current condition: I recovered in end-June and was immediately called to join the ship as there is a major supply chain crisis around the world now. I had to fly to Mumbai but since Calcutta-Mumbai flights are suspended, had to change flights in Varanasi.I stayed in quarantine in Mumbai for a week, tested again and then flew to Paris (India and France have a diplomatic bubble allowing flights) and then Egypt, from where I joined my ship. We are now sailing around the dreaded pirate den of Somalia.If we stop working, the world will come to a standstill. Simple things like medicines won’t be available. So after recovering from Covid, I have become a Covid warrior!Debasish BanerjeeHow I got it: Tough to say. I was attending office and even went to Hasnabad for Amphan relief distribution. On June 30, I went to the court in Mayukh Bhavan. On July 3, I developed mild fever at night.
Family status: My wife had fever for just an hour the day before. My daughter had fever from the same day as me, going as high as 102°F.My Covid battle: All three of us got tested on July 6 and received Covid-positive reports the day after. By then, my wife and daughter did not have any more symptoms. From July 9, my condition deteriorated, with oxygen saturation level falling to 91 per cent. I felt pressure in the chest and was vomiting. Though I could manage a bed at Peerless Hospital, we had trouble getting an ambulance. My friend from Paschimbanga Bigyan Mancha Basab Basak of FE Block offered to drive me but I declined. Finally, an ambulance came from the hospital.Most people were supportive. Since my wife and daughter were confined at home, neighbours brought them supplies. Since the ATM was out of bounds, familiar rickshaw-pullers offered cash to tide us over. The ward assistant too offered help as did my office colleagues. Rajarshi Roy, our local doctor, refused to take fees.I had heard doctors rarely visit Covid wards. But at Peerless, they regularly came and spoke to me. Facebook messages from neighbours also cheered me. I was there for 14 days, from July 11. For 11 days, I was on oxygen support. The last three days they took me off oxygen and kept me under observation. The bill was not exorbitant.Current condition: I have still not joined office as I have a patch in my lungs and am on follow-up treatment. My daughter, 22, has decided to donate plasma at AMRI, Dhakuria.Ramaprasad PaulHow I got it: Tough to say. I say in jest: Chin theke holo.Family status: My 72-year-old wife Ratna too tested positive.My Covid battle: I felt feverish on June 29. The next day I had cough. We got blood tests done for typhoid and dengue. When my cough increased and there was no let up in fever we went for a Covid-19 test on July 9. The report came on JulyOur apartment was sealed by NKDA the day after. My son stays in Mumbai and my daughter in the US. Yet within hours, they arranged for two oxygen cylinders, a thermal gun and a pulse oximeter delivered at our doorstep. My temperature was shooting up to 104°F and I had to take paracetamol every few hours. My son would consult with our doctor Joydip Pande even at 2am and procured the medicine FabiFlu within weeks of its launch in Mumbai. When our oxygen saturation level dropped, we would take oxygen for 15 minutes and check again after three hours. Since our blood pressure was fluctuating, we were asked to speak less for a few days. My temperature decreased after four days of the antibiotic course.From July 13 to 28, we sanitised the common areas of the building daily at our own cost. Yet the security guards and our driver were stopped from coming to our floor. Neighbours stopped calling us, as if the virus would pass through the phone line! Mind you, I am the president of the residents’ association.Current condition: I say I am back half way from Dhapa (crematorium)!saltlake@abpmail.co",2020-08-14 14:58:00
1132,Snehal Sengupta,"Salt lake: Footpaths to be fixed, not roads - Telegraph India","You may be having a tough time negotiating potholes on your way to the market but for now it’s — not the streets but — the footpaths that are being repaired.Sidewalks being worked upon include main thoroughfares including the First Avenue that connects Salt Lake to Ultadanga, the Seventh Cross Road that leads from the Karunamoyee intersection to the Tank 8 Island as well as the roads inside several blocks of the township.But the work has come as surprise to residents who feel that it’s the roads that are crying for repairs.A CJ Block resident said that she was taken aback when several labourers started uprooting kerbstones in front of her house. According to Swati Choudhury, the stretch of pavement in front of her house had no broken stretches but the workers told her that the older kerbstones and paver blocks had to be removed as they would lay new ones in their place.“I was taken shocked. They had dug up a perfect pavement just because they wanted to replace the paver blocks. When I told them that they should repair the innumerable ditches that dot the roads they said that they were there to just carry out pavement repairs,” said Choudhury.A civic engineer said that pavement repairs would be carried out in AB, AC, CJ, and CK blocks. He said the tender for the pavement repairs had been called for before the pandemic struck and work started a few days back.When asked why no road repairs were being carried out despite the rains leaving crater-ridden streets across the township, the engineer said that they had not called for the tenders of the road repairs yet.Tapas Chatterjee, deputy mayor and the mayoral council member in charge of roads, said they had conducted a survey of the damaged roads in the township and would carry out patchwork repairs for the time being.“The top layer of the roads has got washed away by the rains in several places. We are drawing up a list of the roads that need repairs and will make do with patchwork for the time being. Once the rains are over we will carry out extensive repairs,” said Chatterjee.He also added that the pavement repairs were long overdue and that work had started in phases. “We will repair all roads and sidewalks before the pujas,” Chatterjee said.",2020-08-14 15:09:00
1133,Sudeshna Banerjee,Four out of 99 found positive in New Town rapid antibody test camp - Telegraph India,"A rapid test camp was organised by New Town Residents’ Welfare Forum on August 1 at a fishery association building, near Axis Mall. A total of 99 residents were tested to check whether they had already developed Covid-19 antibodies.
Of them, four came positive, indicating they had got infected in the past and recovered on their own. Two results were inconclusive. The others came negative..According to a health department official, while positive results in a Rapid Antibody Test are confirmed, those who come negative but have symptoms of Covid-19 have to go for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. “Many health workers and social workers wanted to get themselves tested. Even people with slight sore throat are panicking. So we thought of holding this camp,” said Samir Gupta, joint convenor of the forum",2020-08-14 15:29:00
1134,The Telegraph,Salt lake: Dance & chant online for deity - Telegraph India,"Every participant of Gulabi Gang performed enthusiastically for their Rathayatra programme but a mother-daughter duo performed twice.Mousumi and Amisha Saha’s phone blared the song Kanha so jah zara but their screens blacked out. None of the others, tuned from their houses over video call, could catch a glimpse.  “If time permits, we shall ask the duo to give a repeat performance,” said the moderator Mahua De Sarkar.Gulabi Gang, a group by ladies from DB Block, usually celebrate Rathayatra at their community hall. “Every year, women take the lead in organising the procession and we celebrate the festival in a grand way. This year we found out alternative means of celebration,” said member Sonali Basak.The show had begun with the Rinku Banerjee blowing the conchshell and chanting mangalacharan.  Sampurna Das and Sambit Das, both tots, danced to Jagannath vandana.Lakshmimoni Sen logged in from Bangalore, chanting Vishnu sahasranaam. Priyanka Niyogi presented Sabdam in Bharatanatyam and Indrani Basak, logged in from Delhi, spoke on the history and significance of the chariot festival focusing on the Rathayatra of Mahesh, as depicted by Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay in the novel Radharani.Panchojonyo, comprising members Mahua De Sarkar, Basak, Chandrani Mukherjee, Mou Dubey and Anjana Banerjee, presented Dashabatar Mahatwo, depicting the 10 incarnations of lord Vishnu. This piece was brought to life with the chorus chanting of the Upanishad sloka Om Purnamadah Purnamidam accompanied by dance performed by Mukherjee and Basak, depicting each avatar. Other members chanted slokas on the avatars with their description in Sanskrit and Bengali.  “This event gives us a sense of freedom in the present suffocating environment and we are rejuvenated,” said Dubey.  
“We members are active because of such events and are also getting tech-savvy,” added Anjana Banerjee.  Child artiste Sharanya Mitra danced to Woh Kisna hai, Ishani Das danced to Jai Narayan vandana with Odissi steps while her sister Jhupan sang along. “We equate Narayana with Jagannath and we paid tribute through the song. I’m especially happy that I could involve my four-and-a-half year old daughter Sampurna in the show and teach her about the lord.”
And finally, at long last, mother-daughter Mousumi and Amisha got a chance to once again dance to a song from Baahubali 2. This time there was no interruption.Bharati KanjilalIf you want to get a programme featured in this column, write in to The Telegraph Salt Lake, 6, Prafulla Sarkar Street,

1135,The Telegraph,New Town art and essay contest: And the winners are... - Telegraph India,"Rhea SenAge: 17
Sunrise Point, Action Area IISome new words which got added to our repertoire in the recent past have not been very happy ones.“Lockdown”, “containment”, “quarantine” all perpetrate a fear of bondage, of captivity in our normal lives. We have even coined a term such as “the New Normal” to console ourselves. If I ask myself, ‘Am I happy? Am I free?’ the answer is a big no. Although lockdown and Covid-19 have generated a fair share of laughter and given us fodder for humour in social media but the irony is not hidden. We have laughed at the poor guy waiting for his daily tea and made him into a social hero. Masking and unmasking have also given us memes to tickle our funny bone but yet we are still slaves to this ailment which has taken the world by storm.We blew conch shells, beat upon drums and utensils, lit candles to bring back the hope of regaining our freedom but alas, we are still down in the doldrums of coronavirus. A little microscopic organism has enslaved us. On this eve of Independence Day, I urge my countrymen to understand and adopt the true path to freedom. Let us be responsible to ourselves, our families and friends and to the world around us. If we apply our logical minds beyond candles and conch shells, the path is clear for us to see.The path defined by science, paved by doctors and health workers and a destination being identified by our researchers.As we wait for the miracle vaccine, let us all be aware, let us help each other to find that freedom where we will wake up one day as free souls. Untouched by fear, unmarred by mask and untethered by the chains of social distance, we will regain our freedom.What does this freedom actually stand for, is it only our ability to walk around, visit people, go on trips? It is much larger and more encompassing than that. It means freedom from economic downturn, it means work for daily wage earners, it means business for shops who do not have online selling facility, it means students on the other side of digital divide can start their education, it means less anxiety for our parents who live in fear of job cuts, it means lot of families can go home and meet their loved ones and it means peace to a lot of stressed minds. As we approach Independence Day, I pray to the almighty to give us patience to bear, give us reason to believe and hope to live for that new sunrise. A sunrise that will bring health, happiness and prosperity to the world.Into that heaven of freedom my father let just not my country but this world awake.Adrija BasakAge: 14

What is a person without his freedom? He is like music without notes or art without feeling.Freedom has always been mankind’s greatest wish. Every person works for his freedom, from dependence, from a cage or from restrictions of society. How many of the most celebrated figures in our history were harbingers of freedom? Freedom truly is the most fundamental requirement for a person to be healthy, happy and to reach their full potential.In a world which is growing and shrinking at the same time, where each person seems to have a fabricated life, where the world is available to us at our fingertips, this freedom has only grown in value. The emergence of the Covid-19 virus seems to have put a stop to social activity and the simple freedom of going out without danger. So many of the things that we had taken for granted like strolls in the park, going out with friends, a weekend outing, a long vacation and of course, travelling, are now lost to us. A world like this seems to be a gray world indeed.But, have we really lost all our freedom? I believe that we have not. Freedom is in the choice we make to not go outside unnecessarily, to protect ourselves and those we love.Freedom is in the way we choose to help and stand by others in a time like this. Freedom comes from having the power within ourselves to do something to help ourselves and
others.We must try to keep ourselves safe by repeated handwashing and going out only when required. There is a certain kind of quiet freedom in following rules, in knowing that what I am doing is for the good of everybody, even when it seems inconsequential.Let us not look at rules as restrictions but as the choices we make to protect others. Freedom comes from the mind. It may seem that we are physically in a cage, but if we truly believe that we are free in our hearts and in our minds, then there is nothing and no one between ourselves and freedom. This can be done by keeping our thoughts clear from negativity. When a person is surrounded by news of Covid-19 cases and the rising death-toll, there is a feeling of hopelessness and imminent danger. To prevent this, the best thing we can do is to turn off the news channels and focus on something positive, like learning a new skill or spending more time with family. We should and we must try to help the elderly people we know, both by providing mental support and also by helping them in their required shopping. Let us focus on improving ourselves, on being a better person and a good citizen.During a trying time like this, our freedom is in our hearts and our souls and we ourselves hold the key to freedom from Covid-19. So, let us work towards a brighter, better and healthier tomorrow, by choosing to follow rules, washing our hands, staying inside, maintaining social distancing and keeping our minds free and healthy. After all, freedom is in the little things in life, in the small steps we take and the conscious choices we make every day.Urjani ShahAge: 7Anahita Housing Complex, Action Area II B, New Town
My parents took me out for a drive and I saw a strange sight. I saw unmasked grown-ups enjoying their ice-cream and phuchkas. They were standing in closed groups and chatting away. Do they know how many people have fallen sick or died today?I have been thinking how my family’s and my lives have changed since Covid-19 came. My mother stopped going to office and started working from home. It was fun at first but then she started nagging me for studying more and more. She is always running after me with her sanitiser. What I miss most is my school, my loving teachers, my class friends, the games we play in our huge playground, the computer lab and the school itself. Though we are having online classes, they are not fun at all. Voices break and my teachers sound like a machine. By the way, do you know I could not have a proper birthday party?So I have been wondering about what to do to get through this situation! Papa says this is the “New Normal”. I asked him what that means, he said that the world has changed since March 2020, when the virus came to visit the world. 7.32 lakh people have died in the world and 44 thousand Indians are dead. So I asked Papa how do we defeat this virus? Then Ma told us that until the vaccine comes we are all unsafe. So I told myself that I will have to fight Corona myself. What can I do?Ma told me this morning that Covid-19 is spreading fast in the poor countries because they do not have clean water to wash their hands, so I have decided not to play with water but to keep on washing hands without Ma having to tell me. Secondly, I will not touch unclean surfaces or unsanitised things. Next, I will never ever forget to wear a mask before going out.Every time I go outside, I will stay six feet away from everybody. I will never ask my parents to take me out to crowded places. Most importantly, I will eat the right food which will give me immunity.Lastly, I will request all my friends to follow SMS i.e. Sanitisation, Mask and Social distancing. I pray to God to give us courage to fight the war against Covid-19. I have faith that we can someday win this war.",2020-08-14 16:16:00
1136,Snehal Sengupta,Seized toucans in isolation at Alipore zoo - Telegraph India,"The pair of Keel-billed toucans that were seized by the BSF in Bongaon, North 24-Parganas, on Thursday are in quarantine at the Alipore zoo hospital.The birds are “traumatised and have not been eating properly”, a zoo official said.The birds were headed to Bangladesh when a BSF team had seized them in the forests near Halderpara village close to the Angrail border outpost, the BSF had said on Thursday.“The birds are quite big… they could barely move inside the cage they had been crammed in. There was no provision for water or food,” S.S. Guleria, DIG, BSF (South Bengal Frontier), said. “Our men gave them fresh water, some fruits and maize.”On Friday morning, vets checked on the birds at the zoo and served them an assortment of apples, pineapples, pomegranates and citrus fruits.The zoo has a toucan at present, director Ashish Kumar Samanta said. “After the completion of their quarantine they will be moved into one of the bigger enclosures. We are not going too close to them… we are leaving them undisturbed as they are quite traumatised… they haven’t eaten much.”Smugglers transport birds and animals in dismal conditions, a forest department official said. “Their welfare is the last thing on the mind of smugglers. They just want to transport them secretly.”The Keel-billed toucans are native to the rainforests of South America.",2020-08-15 02:06:00
1137,Our Special Correspondent,Taxi check reveals body in vegetable bag - Telegraph India,"Cops randomly checking vehicles near Science City early on Friday found a woman’s body in a sack stuffed with vegetables in a taxi’s boot.The taxi had two passengers, a man and a woman, apart from the driver when a police patrol from Pragati Maidan police station stopped the vehicle.The two have been identified as Malina Mandal, the prime accused, and Ajay Rang, a family friend, and the dead woman, Suja Mani Gayen, the police said.They apparently told cops they had killed the woman and that they were on their way to dispose of the body.Preliminary investigations showed Gayen was the mother-in-law of Mandal’s daughter, an officer of Pragati Maidan police station said. “It appears Mandal wanted to eliminate Gayen... she has said Gayen used to torture her daughter.”Mandal has said in her statement that she and her husband had thrashed Gayen, 60, with a bamboo stick before strangling her to death, the police said.Mandal, a resident of Arupota village in Chowbaga, is a vegetable vendor. She had chosen to hide the body in a sackful of vegetables, the police said.Gayen, a resident of Kabardanga in the Haridevpur area, was brought to Mandal’s home on some pretext.Mandal has claimed the motive behind the murder was the deceased woman’s torture against her daughter but cops are still to verify the claim.“We will question Mandal’s daughter to check the veracity of her mother’s claims. Even if the claims turn out to be true, it does not justify the killing,” an officer said.Mandal, her brother Basu Mandal, and Rang were arrested on charges of murder later on Friday.Her husband is still to be arrested. Investigations are on to find out if the taxi driver was involved in the crime, the police said.",2020-08-15 02:15:00
1138,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Rejection of cashless claims of patients at hospitals with mild symptoms; companies defend stand  - Telegraph India,"Many Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms and admitted to private hospitals or satellite facilities are having their cashless insurance claims rejected because the insurance companies think they could have been treated at home.Insurance companies allege that many hospitals are admitting such patients because they need minimum treatment but the healthcare units can earn through diagnostic investigations.Public health experts and officials of various hospitals, however, said the purpose of taking out a medical insurance policy gets defeated if it is of no use during the pandemic.“As per the available documents/medical records, indication for the hospitalisation cannot be established hence cashless approval would not be possible at this juncture,” a Covid-19 patient who had been admitted to a private hospital in Calcutta received this message from the insurance company before he was discharged. The man was left with no option but to pay the entire amount from his pocket.In another case, a New Alipore resident alleged that his parents who had tested positive for Covid-19 were taken to Belle Vue Clinic for admission earlier this month. His father is 63 and mother, a diabetic, 61.“Belle Vue officials said that since my parents had mild symptoms, the cashless facility might be denied to them if they got admitted to the hospital.They suggested that my parents be admitted to the satellite facility run by Belle Vue,” said businessman Deepak Gupta. “A CT scan my father underwent before admission showed pneumonia. So, we got both admitted to the satellite centre. We were scared that if something happened to them at home and the doctor was not available over the phone, we might not be able to hospitalise them immediately,” he said.Later, the third-party administrator (TPA) said the claims were inadmissible. “The TPA told me I got my parents admitted only to get some investigations done. I told them that I could not have put their lives at risk by getting them admitted to hospital in this situation just to get some investigations done,” Gupta said. “The present claim is for treatment of Covid-19 positive. Patient is mainly admitted for investigation and observation purpose and treated with oral medicine and certificate given by treating doctor and discharge certificate revealed that it seems that present treatment is possible in an OPD basis or any institutional quarantine centre,” the TPA had written to Gupta.TPAs handle claims for insurance companies.Finally, Gupta had to pay Rs 2.25 lakh to get his parents discharged. He said he would file reimbursement claims with the insurance company. 
The health ministry and state government have advised asymptomatic Covid patients or those with mild symptoms to stay at home or satellite facilities so that hospital beds remain free for patients with moderate or severe symptoms.“But there are many asymptomatic patients who don’t have isolation facilities at home. There are others who have family members with co-morbidities, and so they want to be admitted,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital. “We have about 150 Covid patients at our hospitals, of whom around 35 are asymptomatic who have no home isolation facilities.” Officials of various private hospitals attributed refusals by insurance companies to confusion and mistrust.“Some insurance firms have issued clear guidelines for allowing cashless facilities for asymptomatic and mild symptom patients even if they are admitted at a satellite facility. Big insurance companies like National Insurance should come out with such clear guidelines, otherwise TPAs are confused over allowing claims,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic. He said the hospital was frequently having patients whose cashless claims were rejected by insurance companies.Medica Superspecialty Hospital chairman Alok Roy said there were frequent problems over insurance claims for patients admitted at his hospital. Insurance companies said hospitals needed to have more transparency. “The advice for admission should be followed by an active line of treatment which is possible only in a hospital set-up. Otherwise, the claim might be inadmissible if it is only for quarantine or isolation.Hospitalisation should have a valid reason,” said Saurav Kariwala, assistant manager (medical), National Insurance Company Ltd, Calcutta.An official of a private insurance company said there were homecare packages. “There are telemedicine and wellness cells of insurance agencies which support such patients (asymptomatic patients or ones with mild symptoms),” said Abhijit Banerjee, manager, claims department, Star Health Insurance.",2020-08-15 02:20:00
1139,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus lockdown: Airport business stalls and retiring rooms take off - Telegraph India,"There’s hardly any commercial activity at the city airport because of the pandemic but the revamped retiring rooms and dormitories in the terminal building are doing a roaring business.The number of flights has reduced drastically and so has the number of passengers. But a long time gap between connecting flights and the fear of getting infected with Covid-19 have ensured passengers in transit who would earlier spend the night at a relative’s place in Calcutta are now check-ing into these rooms and dormitories.The airport’s new terminal building has 23 rooms, each with two beds, and two 10-bed dormitories for men and women.“After flights resumed, the retiring rooms and dormitories are having an almost 80 per cent occupancy daily,” Kaushik Bhattacharya, airport director, said. “We had to reduce the capacity by 50 per cent in the dormitories to maintain safe distance between two beds. We sanitise the rooms after each passenger checks out.”The twin-bed rooms used to be given to two passengers; now, only one passenger or a family is allowed, Bhattacharya said.Mouyukh Roy, who works in Bangalore, was headed home to Silchar when he landed at the Calcutta airport on Friday morning. He arrived with his wife and daughter, who is little over a year old, by an Air India flight from Bangalore. They are scheduled to take a SpiceJet flight to Silchar on Saturday morning.“Earlier, whenever I went home or returned to work via Calcutta, the transit time was two to three hours. If we had to spend the night, we used to stay at a relative’s place,” Roy said. “But this time, we didn’t go to any relatives’ place because of Covid. We are worried for our daughter.”
Roy said he was not aware of the accommodation facility at the airport. “The airport manager told me there is a facility that could be provided based on availability.” He paid around Rs 1,700 for staying the night.Another passenger said he was pleasantly surprised to see the cleanliness in the room he had taken. “We are used to seeing dirty washrooms at Calcutta airport. But the room and adjoining washroom are clean.”Almost 50 per cent of the standalone food and beverage counters, along with 75 per cent of the retail stores, have opened, an airport official said.“But these outlets do barely any business.”The food court and lounges are closed.Calcutta airport now has close to 110 flights arriving and taking off. Before the pandemic struck, the number was close to 500. The passenger count has gone down from the daily average of 60,000 to 14,000.But the retiring rooms and dormitories are always almost full.“On days of total lockdown, they are filled to capacity and we have to refuse many passengers,” an airport official said.",2020-08-15 02:32:00

Details of the application process will be available on and from August 18”.Application forms will have to be submitted by September 4, pro-vice-chancellor Chiranjeeb Bhattacharya said.At JU, a candidate can apply for multiple subjects.Till last year, an applicant had to pay separately for each course, an official of the university said.Now, be it one application or multiple applications, a candidate will not be charged anything, he said.Candidates cannot be charged for applying in multiple colleges as well, an official of the department said.JU had originally planned to activate the site on August 10 in keeping with a July 16 advisory of the state government. But the start had to be delayed to make the system ready for online payment.The education department has ordered that this year fees would have to be paid online or through designated banks.

Rainey Park and Hazra Road, which featured on the previous list, are there on Friday’s list as well.The list of containment zones is updated every three to four days. The latest list has 29 places. Of them, eight are in Ward 69, in the Ballygunge area. “Ward 69 has become a place of concern for us. Over 30 cases have been reported from the ward in the last few days. So, we felt that some of the places from where the cases have been reported should be turned into containment zones,” said Sandip Ranjan Bakshi, the coordinator of Borough VIII that covers Ballygunge. Bakshi said two adjacent buildings on Rowland Road — 14 Rowland Road and 14A Rowland Road — have been declared as containment zones.One more address on Rowland Road is on the list. The previous list — published on Monday — had only one address from Rowland Road. That has been removed from Friday’s list. “Officials of the civic health department are trying to find out if there is any particular source of infection on Rowland Road,” said Bakshi. The latest list for North 24-Parganas does not have any place from Salt Lake. Duttabad, on the fringes of Salt Lake, is a containment zone. A dozen areas in Dum Dum have been earmarked as containment zones.

1143,Debraj Mitra,"Coronavirus outbreak: Moms with Covid can breastfeed, confirms Doctors - Telegraph India","The Covid-19 pandemic has led to fear that breastfeeding mothers “might transmit” the virus to newborns, said doctors.The doctors asserted that the fear was unfounded and mothers who have symptoms of the disease or tested positive can continue to breastfeed their babies as long as they take some precautions like washing their hands frequently and wearing a mask while nursing babies. Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for babies and it is imperative that newborns are not denied the nutrition, they added.A city paediatrician said she came across multiple cases where the mothers who had tested positive for Covid-19 were scared to breastfeed their babies. “Doctors give a detailed explanation to mothers and they understand. But when they go home from hospital, family members separate the baby and the mother out of fear,” she said.Counselling of mothers and family members and awareness of the community play a key role in debunking myths, said experts.  “There is nothing that suggests that the virus is transmitted through breast milk. Wearing a mask and washing hands regularly are two things that breastfeeding mothers should do regularly to ensure the safety of the newborns,” said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health.Nurses in Covid wards are also facing resistance from family members in getting too close to their babies, said doctors.“All mothers should breastfeed their babies, irrespective of their Covid status. They should maintain respiratory hygiene. A mother should not be separated from her baby unless she is extremely ill,” said Neena Ghosh, a paediatrician associated with the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.Some “Actions for breastfeeding mothers” on the WHO website are:⚫Practice respiratory hygiene, including during feeding. If you have respiratory symptoms such as being short of breath, use a medical mask when near your child⚫Wash your hands thoroughly with soap or sanitiser before and after contact with your child⚫Routinely clean and disinfect any surfaces you touch“We have witnessed a 250 per cent rise in Indians consulting online for gynaecology since March and one of the most discussed topics was breastfeeding,” said a spokesperson of Practo, a digital healthcare platform.Arockia Virgin Fernando, a gynaecologist who consults on Practo, said: “The Covid-19 virus does not spread during the time of delivery and the only possibility it might infect a child is through air post-birth.”August 1 to 7 was the International Breastfeeding Week.",2020-08-15 03:01:00

MR Bangur is a dedicated Covid hospital. At safe homes stay Covid patients with mild to moderate symptoms, who may suddenly need oxygen support. “When the coronavirus infects the lungs, it usually results in shortage of oxygen,” said pulmonologist Sumit Sengupta. “In order to make up for the shortage created by the viral infection, oxygen needs to be supplied from outside. It is not a treatment but support.”Health department officials said uninterrupted supply of oxygen was emerging as the most important “life-saving support” for many Covid-19 patients with lung infection. “We have asked hospitals and authorities of safe homes to make arrangements for uninterrupted flow of oxygen,” said Gopal Krishna Dhali, the head of the department of gastroenterology at SSKM Hospital, who is leading the team of doctors for Covid-19 management.",2020-08-15 03:17:00
1145,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus outbreak: Presidency online form filing from August 18 - Telegraph India,"Undergraduate aspirants at Presidency University can start submitting forms online from August 18. The process will go on till September 1.“Candidates will not be charged any application fee. They can apply for a maximum of two subjects,” registrar Debajyoti Konar said.Except for statistics and economics, the merit list for all subjects will be based on marks obtained in the secondary and higher secondary board exams.September 5 has been fixed as the tentative date for the publication of merit list and other lists.The admission notification uploaded on the university’s website on Saturday says how the subject-wise merit list will be drawn up factoring in the weightage from board marks.The admission notification contains two tables — one for the parameters and the other explaining the formula for preparing the academic score.The parameter for chemistry honours says average percentage of marks obtained in physical science and life science or the percentage of marks obtained in science in the Class X board exams and the percentage of marks obtained in chemistry, mathematics and English in the Plus II board exams will be factored in.The formula for preparing the score says from each of the four parameters, 25 per cent weightage will be taken to prepare the merit list.In physics honours, the percentage of marks obtained in mathematics, along with the average percentage of marks obtained in physical science and life science or the percentage of marks obtained in science will be considered from the Class X board results.“This will be added to the percentage of aggregate marks and that obtained in mathematics in the Plus II board exams. Here, too, from each of the four parameters, 25 per cent weightage will be taken to prepare the merit list,” a university official said.The teachers of the physics and chemistry departments had proposed in the previous meeting of the admission committee on the science that apart from factoring in Plus II board results, the scores in physical science and mathematics in Madhyamik be considered, given that the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education could not hold tests in the papers because of the pandemic.The students had the best marks in the papers they had written awarded to the ones they could not.  In case of a tie, candidates will be judged considering their percentage of aggregate marks obtained in HS or equivalent exam at the first instance.If the tie persists, the process will be repeated considering the percentage of marks obtained by them in Madhyamik or equivalent 10th standard exam.“If the tie still exists, all such candidates will be placed in the same rank and considered for admission with a method called bunching effect,” Konar said.",2020-08-16 00:38:00
1146,"Fr. J. Felix Raj, SJ",Time for all to speak out against fundamentalism - Telegraph India,"India completed 73 years as an Independent nation on August 15. With a total population of 138.13 crore as of August 7, 2020, which is 17.7 per cent of the world’s population, India is the largest democracy in the world.It is a fact that a third of the world’s poor live in India. In our country, 27.1 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. The per capita income is $2,500, which is 1/13 of developed countries. India ranks 129 in the human development index in 2019. India faces, besides economic and political instability, frequent ethnic and communal outbursts, which have proved fatal to its overall development.India, the cradle of religions, is steeped in a sense of the sacred. We sense a cosmic worldview to life with rich cultural diversity expressed in art, architecture, music and the rich classical and folk traditions. But modern social media, IT and LPG (liberalisation, privatisation, globalisation) forces are posing a serious threat to its much-desired development.The glaring reality of the vast multitude of poor, the varied deprivation and dehumanisation, rampant corruption and injustice and the inevitable exclusion of the displaced, untouchable, women, indigenous and migrant communities confront India. The exploitation of our ecosystems further aggravates the plight of the poor.Democracy is a communications-intensive mode of governance in which individuals play a more direct role through “the power of citizen-to-citizen communications”, which benefits both themselves and their community. A successful society is one that gives opportunities to its citizens and promotes its capacities in equality so that citizens think, work, grow and develop in an atmosphere of freedom.The contentment of citizens is closely linked to the level of political and social empowerment they have. Where citizens control the agenda, stability and contentment is enhanced. Even though we have made some progress, government systems and administrative functioning have many weaknesses and inadequacies, which are proving quite a handicap in providing satisfactory deliverance of services to people.The present political system and the process require purification so that political will is strengthened to take necessary action against forces that generate corruption and sow the seeds of division, casteism, hatred and communal violence. There is a need for transparency and accountability at all levels.India’s legal and judicial systems are highly sophisticated and well developed. Despite that, it has not kept pace with the changing needs arising from increasing population, increase in number of laws, increase in industrial activities and other changes resulting in inordinate delays in disposal of cases. The present judicial system does not render speedy justice to people. A comprehensive review of the system is required.Secularism in India is different from the western concept of the state in confrontation with the Church. Indian secularism was born out of an experience, a painful process of national liberation struggles.The Fathers of our Constitution had reasons to introduce secularism in our country: fear of disorder arising from dangerous forces of political movements associated with militant Hindu nationalism, Muslim separatism, Hindu-Muslim communalism and so on.Nehru condemned casteism and communalism. He observed that communalism was fascism in India and favoured secularism. For him, secularism was necessarily a civilised behaviour. This was to transcend religious, cultural, caste differences and combat militant communalist forces.Human civilisation has brought into focus the significance of secular ideals, and there is a growing consciousness to support and nurture this type of societies. Today, almost all countries in the world have come to accept that secularism is sine quo non for democratic governance.To establish a peaceful and just society, secularist principles and democratic polity are indispensable.All true religions have an immense potential for tolerance. Each religious community claims that theirs is the most tolerant religion of our time. Their claim is true so long as they recognise other religions as different ways leading to the same goal.Tolerance is a normative value; yes, but it is not an answer to the fundamentalist danger to unity and integrity of our country. In today’s context, what we need is to affirm and perpetuate: rootedness of every believer in his/her religion; acceptance of the other and his/her religious belief and practice; and ongoing dialogues between different religions. These are the principles that will pave the way for a healthy atmosphere of respect, tolerance and acceptance of each other, of each religious tradition and enable us to live together as Indians in peace and harmony.
 There is an urgent need for spirituality that considers persons as subjects and not objects of history. A spirituality that considers men and women as sacred, unique, irreplaceable and irreducible human beings, free by nature and called to transcendence. A spirituality that is human and acceptable to all religions. It should recognise the cultural diversity, the uniqueness of national and local cultures and heritage. Steeped in the sense of the sacred, it should take a holistic approach to life that life is sacred and that all beings journey towards the cosmic unity. Spirituality plays a major role in building human communities based on peace and harmony.Spirituality liberates and empowers through a sense of shared purpose. Such a sense of purpose is a prerequisite for national unity and social cohesion. To lack a shared sense of purpose is to invite drift and division.Spirituality, with its regenerating power, holds the promise of a new beginning. Optimisation of the wholeness of humanity with a special focus on human development and well-being is the quintessential spiritual purpose. It is spirituality that sustains development in society. It is the soul of all human actions. It is a powerful tool, which could bring religions together to fight against the dangers of globalisation: materialism, egocentrism, consumerism, and destruction of the environment and the crises of family and neighbourhood ties.It is time now for all academics, thinkers, philosophers, theologians and the like to come out openly and speak out against the dangers of fundamentalism and its offshoots of disorder, and undo, with the weapon of their wisdom, all that has gone wrong.Politicians are not capable of doing this job. All that they normally seek is power and for more power, they justify any means. If the age of enlightenment and of science has brought changes in the west, our intervention at this juncture will definitely put the wheels of our country on the right track.What the German Bishop Niemoler said about the situation under Hitler might teach us something: “When Nazis put communists in the concentration camp, I did not protest because I was not a communist; when they persecuted the social democrats, I did not protest because I was not a social democrat; when they massacred the Jews, I did not protest because I was not a Jew; when they banned all political parties and trade unions, I did not protest because I was not one of them; when they came for me, there was no one to speak for me.”The author is the vice-chancellor of St Xavier’s University, Kolkata",2020-08-16 00:51:00

Rakshit was arrested for cheating Sayantan Bhanja of Rs 1.28 crore by making him invest in bitcoins, police said.In his complaint with the police, Bhanja has alleged that between January 2017 and March 2018 he had invested Rs 1.52 crore in Rakshit’s firm.He has said that Rakshit paid him Rs 24.22 lakh as returns from the investment to gain his trust. Of this amount Rakshit had returned Rs 3.5 lakh in two months in 2018.When the returns stopped from April 2018, Bhanja visited Rakshit’s Hazra office and found it to always locked, he has said in the complaint.He filed the complaint in December 2019 and the detective department’s special cell started investigating the matter.A team of officers froze two of Rakshit’s bank accounts in two private banks. But he remained untraceable. On Friday, officers learnt he had returned to his Hazra office. A team raided the office and arrested him.Rakshit has pleaded ignorance and said he has been framed. A city court has sent him to police custody till August 19, an officer said.“Bhanja had met Rakshit in the Baghajatin area in 2016. He had introduced himself to Bhanja as the CEO of an investment company,” a detective department officer said. “Bhanja was then looking for avenues to invest in order to expand his business.”In the course of the next few meetings, Rakshit told Bhanja about bitcoins. One of his executives even followed up the matter with Bhanja.  Bhanja ended up paying Rs 1.52 crore, the police said. When he realised he had been cheated, he filed the complaint.In April, singer Anupam Roy had lodged a complaint with the police alleging he had received a mail where the sender claimed to have accessed his personal data and demanded payment in bitcoins to let go his personal data.The same month, two professionals, who were working from home and using an app to make video calls, had received ransomware threats demanding payment in bitcoins, an officer said. The complainants had said they received a specific link in their mails to buy bitcoins, the officer said.",2020-08-16 01:00:00
1148,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus outbreak: Independence Day salute to Covid fighters - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee stepped off the dais during the Independence Day parade on Red Road to  greet and felicitate 25 Calcuttans who have survived Covid-19 and returned to fight against the pandemic.The list includes doctors, nurses, lab technicians, ambulance drivers, resource teachers, block development officers, Asha workers, cleaning staff and police personnel.All the 25 people had got infected while on duty.Among them was hospital cleaner Manoj Kumar Ram from Beleghata ID hospital and Jitendra Hela from the School of Tropical Medicine. There were Asha workers Ratna Karmakar from the Nalmuri block primary health centre in South 24-Parganas and Sufiya Khatoon from the Biswanathpur block primary health centre at Deganga, North 24-Parganas.The list of doctors included Narayan Chattopadhyay from Howrah district hospital, Shabnam Banu and S.M. Ayaz Ahmed from Calcutta Medical College and Hospital and BDOs Kamrul Islam and Bipratim Basak from Minakhan (North 24-Parganas) and Kultali (South 24-Parganas).The list included ambulance driver Riyaz Gazi from Madhyamgram Municipality and laboratory technician Bani Kumar Patra from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.Many personnel have been subjected to humiliation in their neighbourhoods, stigmatised for what they do and threatened. They have stuck on with their work despite the hardships.Unlike other years, the Independence Day parade was not opened to the public, keeping in mind the pandemic. The event was attended by a handful of dignitaries.At the beginning of the event, Mamata Banerjee came down from the dais and met the 25 Covid warriors on Red Road.“She spoke to each of them and greeted them for their courage for winning the Covid war and joining their office where they are again dedicated to fight Covid,” an officer present at the ceremony said.The chief minister had been praising and supporting the role of personnel who have risked their lives to serve others during this crisis.According to sociologist Upal Chakrabarti of Presidency University, the felicitation of 25-odd “Covid warriors” was not just a felicitation of a few individuals but it sends a larger message to society on the service rendered by the entire fraternity who are braving the pandemic to do their duty.“This is not just a positive message to all those who offered this service, which is no less than national service beyond political boundaries, but also a strong message that Covid is not about spreading panic but is a matter of management.”
Around 50 members of the community had gathered at the mosque, wearing masks and maintaining social distance. A community scout band played the national anthem before the flag was hoisted.

1149,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Smartphone, data pack for 800 Jadavpur University students for online classes - Telegraph India","Jadavpur University will provide smartphones and high-speed data packs to 800-odd students so they can attend online classes, which are to start on September 14. The university had carried out a survey among the students of engineering, science and arts faculty and the study revealed that as many as 800-odd students are in need of support, said a university official.The students in need of help have been split into two categories. “The students who do not have a smartphone are in the first category. And those who do have a smartphone but lack a high-speed data pack to download lectures and audio visual presentations from the university’s website or social media are in the second category,” the official said.“We will distribute smartphones and high-speed data to the students who need them,” vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said. “A large number of students need a data pack. We have decided to raise a corpus. The teachers have been asked to contribute a day’s salary. The university will approach business houses for funds to buy the devices for the learners.” JU has 600 teachers and around Rs 10 lakh can be raised if each donates a day’s salary, a teacher said.Classes in non-contact mode, which will not require students to come to the campus, will start in September.Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das had advised the teachers to come up with models on how classes can start. In response the teachers suggested that study materials — notes, soft copies of textbooks, powerpoint presentations, and audio and video lectures — be delivered to the students through email and WhatsApp.A university official said some teachers had suggested creating a central repository on the university’s website, which would have a section where course materials would be uploaded.“Since the central repository will fall short of adequate space for so many lectures and audio-visual presentation, it has been proposed that the lectures and study materials be also uploaded on YouTube. Students will be given a link to download the content from the platform,” said the official.Partha Pratim Roy, an associate professor of physics at JU, said they had urged the VC to have an outreach approach so that students lacking basic connectivity were not left out of the classes.Many students in JU are from the Sunderbans in South 24-Parganas, which suffered immense destruction after being hit by Cyclone Amphan on May 20. “Those living in the Sunderbans had their roofs blown away by the May 20 cyclone. They are reeling under the twin blows of the storm and the pandemic. They cannot be expected to buy smartphones,” Roy said.",2020-08-17 02:26:00
1150,Subhajoy Roy,Covid note during discharge to clear confusion about double swab test - Telegraph India,"Covid-19 patients in hospitals or safe homes will get a note during discharge which will mention that they do not need to undergo any more swab test to confirm that they are free of the novel coronavirus, health department officials said.The department has taken the decision following reports that there is confusion among people about the need for a swab test immediately before a Covid-19 patient is discharged as well as after discharge, the officials said.“It has been observed that there is a large degree of confusion amongst Covid affected patients, their relatives, in the neighbourhoods and people at large regarding the need of testing before discharge from hospitals or safe homes,” reads the order issued on Friday by the state’s director of health services, Ajay Chakraborty.The order includes a text that should be part of every discharge certificate.“The patient was suffering from Covid-19 and was under treatment from… to.... The patient is now stable and discharged with advice for home isolation for next 7 days. He is instructed to follow all the home isolation guidelines strictly and to report to the local hospital if any symptoms appear at any time. Further test for Covid-19 is not necessary as per the ICMR protocol,” the text reads.The note will also mention the duration of a patient’s stay in hospital.“There was a lot of confusion among people whether a negative report of Covid-19 is needed or not during discharge. As per guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), such a test report is not needed. We have now circulated a text that doctors should write during discharge of patients,” said Chakraborty.The discharge note is necessary because several patients were asked to provide a negative test result before they are allowed to return to their apartments and/or neighbourhoods.Metro had on August 7 reported that a recovered Covid-19 patient in a south Calcutta apartment was asked by the residents’ welfare association to get tested after 14 days and then step out.In the absence of any clear communication from the health department, the residents’ welfare associations of many housing complexes and standalone buildings are taking it upon themselves to decide when a resident who has recovered from Covid will step out.Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health specialist and mentor of Covid Care Network (an organisation comprising doctors, officials and people who have recovered from Covid-19), said the organisation had received requests for certificates from many recovered patients.“There was a need for a clear order from the government…. We have been receiving requests from many recovered patients to give them a certificate that they do not need to undergo a test,” said Chowdhury.Patients in home isolation can get such a certificate from the doctor who advised home isolation, an official said. Sanjib Bandopadhyay, a doctor at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, said some doctors were issuing those certificates.“The ICMR protocol said any mild or moderate patient who is discharged from hospital and stays in home isolation for seven days does not need to undergo a test,” he said. “If any doctor declines to give the certificate, the patient can come to our Covid-19 follow-up clinic.”The clinic is held every Wednesday, from 11am to 2pm.",2020-08-17 02:34:00
1151,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya ,"Mrityunjay may not enjoy a privileged place in the hierarchy of North Calcutta sweet shops, it nonetheless enjoys a sweet spot with the morning walkers of south Calcutta - Telegraph India","A city usually comes with two kinds of environmental heritage: natural and built. In Calcutta both are under tremendous threat. About our city being the cultural capital of India, the less said the better. Calcutta, many feel now, has only one real heritage item to showcase: its food.The city lives, breathes and certainly eats its food. The past is never disowned when it comes to food. It is cherished, rediscovered, maintained and even fought over. Look how passionately Bengal staked its claim to rosogolla. True, tradition is often subjected to “fusion”; and the purist may object to a lyangcha tart. But done well, it leaves a much better aftertaste than bling on Tangail.Not that Calcutta food — especially its world of mishtis — is sweet and uncomplicated. The lyangcha is being challenged by the tart. Also, there is a caste system. When it comes to mishtis, the North looks down on the South. Ask a connoisseur about the heritage mishti shops of Calcutta and he is likely to rattle off a procession of names that spell vintage, class and refinement: Girish and Nakur, Bhabatarini, Makhanlal Das, Putiram, Haridas Modak and Bhim Chandra Nag. None of these addresses are located in the other side of Dharmatala. Yes, there may be a Balaram or a Mithai in the South, but North Calcutta is a star-studded show.So a place like Mrityunjay Ghosh and Sons, or just “Mrityunjay” as it is known in and around Lansdowne Road, where it is located, almost opposite Lansdowne Market, does not enjoy that privileged a place in this hierarchy. Those who know Mrityunjay, however, think of it as joy in the morning, to quote P.G. Wodehouse.The air around the almost 90-year-old shop, which has the names of its mishtis and savoury items written in clear bold, Bengali letters in white against blue on its spectacular front, is redolent with the smells of its kochuri and singara. The singara has a slightly sweet edge.  The matarshuti kochuri and the radhaballabhi are served with aloor torkari or chholar dal. They are fried fresh. It is hard for the morning walker to ignore that smell and keep going.The lyangchas are soft, succulent and plump. But the most special item served here is roshomundir payesh — tiny rosogollas half-drowned in sweet heavy thickened milk.The man behind the counter, which is a rectangle cut out on the front, is also the proprietor of Mrityunjay, Somnath Ghosh. He is as unassuming as the shop he runs. The sales from the shop has gone down quite a lot during the lockdown. But that does not prevent Ghosh from there every day at the shop from early morning.He admits that his shop is well-loved in the locality, and adds that one of the most famous Bengali celebrities was among his loyal customers, but he looks slightly surprised about his interview.The shop was started by his grandfather, Mrityunjay, a resident of Howrah who came over to the South. It was handed down to his father and then he joined the business. “That was in 1978, after I graduated in commerce from South City College,” Ghosh said.He takes me through the contents of the old-fashioned showcase that houses the mishtis. An unperturbed, jovial, friendly man, he is most willing to answer my questions, but has very little to say about himself.“The main thing is the chhana ,” he said.Almost nothing has changed in the shop since its beginning. Above hangs the beamed ceiling, from which are suspended two large whirring ceiling fans. On one wall hang two large framed photographs, of Ghosh’s father and grandfather. Two attendants help Ghosh man the shop. The only piece of decoration in the whole establishment is its inscribed front.“And we use fresh ingredients,” adds Ghosh, still answering the question on what makes the mishtis special. But listening to his voice inside the barely-lit shop, a feeling of stillness seems to be settling down inside you along with the gorgeous roshomundi you have just had, muting the din of a busy Calcutta street, noisy despite the lockdown.Everything around Mrityunjay has changed. The buildings, the shops. Just opposite Mrityunjay is a shop called Selfie.Mrityunjay items have not changed, too. The different types of sandesh with a coloured layer, chhanar jilipi, rosogolla, pantua, seeta bhog, kalakand — all remain the same as the past, from the time of his grandfather. “I have only added the gur-kalakand,” says Ghosh. The use of gur in making mishtis throughout the year is one big change from the past. He has stopped short of experimenting with the newer ingredients, like chocolate.At this point my reverie about the past is broken rudely. Ghosh informs me that he is just waiting to “modernise” the place. He is prevented from doing so at the moment because of some practical reasons, but will definitely as soon as he can. What will he change? “Everything,” he says. He points at the showcase, the wall cupboards with the wooden doors, everything.I suddenly feel another little piece of old Calcutta disappearing. But in a city like ours, one person’s heritage is another’s inconvenience. And in the absence of any real thinking about heritage by the authorities, modernisation only means a complete overhaul of the past.But Ghosh did not say anything about the modernisation of the mishtis. I hold on to that as I walk away.",2020-08-17 03:01:00
1152,Snehal Sengupta,New Town property tax deadline extended  - Telegraph India,"The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has extended the deadline for paying self-assessed property tax of the 2019-2020 financial year to December 31 keeping in view the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown to contain it.The original deadline for tax payment was June 2, an NKDA official said.The decision to extend the last date of tax payment was taken after several residents requested the New Town authorities for a “breather given the pandemic situation”, the official said.According to another NKDA official, a total of 17,353 residents paid their taxes by June 2. Another reason cited for extending the deadline is requests from non-resident Calcuttans owning property in New Town, who were unaware of the introduction of taxes and therefore failed to pay in time. “In consideration of the genuine time constraints faced by many, the authority has considered and reviewed the deadline for self-assessment and payment of tax,” the official said Tapan Chakraborty, who owns two apartments in Greenfield Heights, said he was happy that the NKDA had heeded their requests. “We are rarely stepping out because of the pandemic,” he said.NKDA chairman Debashis Sen said they had trained Tax Sathis to help the residents go about the assessment and filing process.",2020-08-17 03:08:00
1153,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Children should be able to think independently without fear - Telegraph India,"Independence is not just about hoisting the national flag. It should also mean an ability to think independently without fear, said those working with children.Children should be free from abuse, child marriage and trafficking, said Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti, the chairperson of the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights.“Only by hoisting the flag one does not become free. Freedom has many layers to it. We know there are many challenges in people’s lives to live or think independently. So on this day we should all pledge that we will support anybody who thinks independently... and children should be free from exploitation, child marriage, sexual abuse, trafficking and they should be entitled to the right to study, play and lead a healthy life…. That is the independence we want for our children,” said Chatterjee Chakraborti.She was speaking at a webinar on “Freedom from Fear” organised by the commission on Saturday, the country’s 74th Independence Day.“The adults need to understand that if we let children think independently and give them courage, then they will be able to lead independent lives,” said psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram.Chatterjee Chakraborti later said fear was not a good thing to live with. “Parents have to trust their children and make them independent rather than impose their dogmas on them. Children should learn on their own and parents have to guide them and show them the path but the choice has to be the child’s,” said Chatterjee Chakraborti.Adults often intrude on the free space of children, which in some cases could be as heinous as exploitation and abuse, and can have a serious outcome, said Ram. He stressed the need to work with families where children are abused but a complaint under the Pocso Act cannot be filed for various reasons.“If a family is not ready to lodge a case, we have to be respectful of their decisions also…but we cannot stop working with them… rehabilitation has a huge significance for the child and family,” said Ram.“There has to be systemic changes, handholding, reassurance that the family or the child needs,” Ram later said.The session was moderated by Yashabanti Sreemany, a member of the commission and a counsellor. “When children or their families come to us we counsel them to come out and talk about the wrong that they have faced. The perpetrators should also not go free,” said Sreemany.Other panellists included Sudeshna Roy, a special consultant of the commission, and actors June, Arjun Chakraborty, Sudipta Chakraborty and Chaiti Ghoshal.",2020-08-17 03:17:00

1155,"Subhajoy Roy, Kinsuk Basu",Coronavirus outbreak: Antigen test in all Calcutta Municipal Corporation clinics - Telegraph India,"The civic health clinics in all 144 wards of Calcutta will have the facility to conduct the rapid antigen test for Covid-19, officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have said.The officials said a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases across the city had prompted the civic authorities to decide to start conducting the test, which produces results much faster than the conventional RT-PCR test for the coronavirus disease, in all civic clinics.“Widespread antigen tests will lead to faster detection and isolation of infected people,” a CMC official said.Public health specialists have repeatedly stressed that in the absence of any drug or vaccine for Covid-19, the best way to combat the disease is to test and isolate as many infected people and as quickly as possible.To start with, the test will be introduced in the clinics of the first 100 wards in the city. The remaining 44 will be gradually added to the list.The CMC now organises camps for the antigen test at various locations on specific days. But once all civic health clinics offer the service, people can get themselves tested on all days the facilities remain open.“Just like conducting dengue and malaria tests, our health clinics will conduct the Covid-19 antigen test,” a CMC official said.The antigen test is known to throw up false negatives but the Indian Council of Medical Research has still approved it because the results arrive within half an hour. The results of the conventional RT-PCR test take about two days to come.“A person who is suffering from Covid-19 is isolated within 30 minutes if she/he tests positive in the antigen test. This helps prevent spread of the infection more effectively,” the CMC doctor said.To deal with the problem of false negatives, the ICMR has said that people who test negative in the antigen test but have symptoms of Covid-19 must undergo the RT-PCR test. Those who are asymptomatic and test negative in the antigen test should be allowed to go.The CMC, which launched the antigen test late last month, had earlier thought about opening antigen test centres in at least three places in each borough.Air-conditioners will be fitted in at least one room in all the clinics where the antigen test will be conducted. The AC rooms are needed because medical technologists who will conduct the test will have to wear personal protective equipment (PPE). Working in a non-AC room wearing a PPE suit is not impossible, an official said.",2020-08-18 00:48:00

1157,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Mugged on Rashbehari - Telegraph India,"A man waiting for a hired motorcycle on Rashbehari Avenue on Friday night was hit on the head with an iron rod and robbed off his phone and wallet.Cops scanned more than 20 CCTV cameras in the area to find the assaulter who ran from Pratapaditya Road to SP Mukherjee Road before slipping into a blanket and taking shelter among a group of sleeping footpath dwellers, police said.Investigators used source information to track him down. Ajay Gayen, 21, was picked up from a night shelter for the homeless on Kali Temple Road in Kalighat on Monday morning. The phone and wallet have been seized.Ajay Kumar Prasad, 31, a resident of Sarsuna, who works at a departmental store near Phoolbagan, returns home daily by making a break journey on Rashbehari Avenue. On Friday, he got “exceptionally late”. He was waiting near the Rashbehari Avenue-Pratapaditya Road crossing after booking a bike, when he was mugged, the police said.The CCTV footage showed Gayen standing near Prasad and watching him. “A ragpicker comes into the picture and he shoos him away. He then picks an iron rod from the road and hits Prasad on the head,” an officer said.Prasad fell on the road but tried to resist the man, the officer said. “Gayen fled with the phone and wallet.”Prasad was bleeding from the head when he visited SSKM. He later lodged a complaint with Tollygunge police station.Gayen, who hails from the Sonarpur area, had been staying at the night shelter. During the day, he cleans the floor of the Kalighat temple compound, the police said.“We are checking his records.

1158,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Teachers advised to ignore home ‘disturbances’   - Telegraph India,"Several city schools have been telling teachers to be more accommodating and to ignore background distractions at the students’ end during online classes.More than four months have passed and there is no clear end to the restrictions in sight. People are losing patience and it is not always possible for family members to vacate a portion of the house for the child’s class, at least two school heads said.Teachers should know they are “intruders” in the private space of families and they should not expect parents or other members to be always in perfect attire and not cause any disturbance, the principal of a city school said.For years, parents had to leave after dropping children off at the school gate but the tables have turned and teachers can no longer tell parents to “stay out”. It is the teachers’ turn to learn to ignore things they cannot control, a principal said.At times, there is background noise over which the child has no control. It can be embarrassing for the child if they are pulled up for no fault of theirs, an administrative head who also teaches said.“We have some guidelines for parents… we tell them to create an environment conducive to an online class but we cannot be rigid about it always because we are aware that not all of them have a dedicated space... there can be some distractions and teachers have to ignore and take it in their stride,” Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, said.Teachers now enter the houses early in the morning; they should not expect parents to be dressed up in their formals for their child’s class, John Bagul, the principal of South City International School, said.“Classrooms have shifted to breakfast tables or bedrooms and teachers have become intruders… they need to understand that there are certain challenges in homes. It can be inconvenient for parents to dress up and teachers have to be realistic; accept the situation and move on,” Bagul said.“In some homes parents have to leave for work in the morning and in some they have to get the household work going… all from the same space. They cannot stay away as long as online classes continue.”The school recently had a meeting with its 150 teachers to tell them to be more accommodating and to ignore background distractions during online classes.At Mahadevi Birla World Academy, teachers in the junior section have been told to be more “empathetic and humane”.At St James’ School, teachers have been asked to be more considerate and understanding of a child’s home environment. “There will be disturbances like servants walking in, doorbells ringing, dogs barking or anything else, all of which can interfere with the child’s concentration,” Terence Ireland, principal of St James’, said.“But we have told teachers to be more considerate and to allow students the freedom to get up and then come back rather than expect them to sit in front of the device throughout the class. One has to understand that classes from home and at school are not the same.”There are homes where siblings or grandparents share the room and it is not possible for them to be always quiet and alert because classes are on. “Just as children, often parents have no control over all that happens in the house. There are occasions when toddlers or younger siblings enter the class… though the student tells the child to move he or she doesn’t,” Nupur Ghosh, the vice-principal at Mahadevi Birla World Academy, said.“We cannot discount the fact that the mother is busy and it is easier said than done to tell parents to always keep the home in order. We tell our teachers to be more sensible, sensitive and mature and not to make a hue and cry about everything. Of course if it becomes a recurring issue we speak to parents individually.”For a teacher, the challenges are much more in an online class than in the classroom. They have to constantly innovate to keep students engaged, a school head said.",2020-08-18 00:54:00
1159,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Old boy donates Rs 50 lakh to IIEST - Telegraph India,"Sunandan Narayan Basu, who had graduated from Bengal Engineering College 64 years ago, has donated Rs 50 lakh to his alma mater and the money could go a long way in bridging the digital divide that is threatening the future of many students in the era of Covid.The 86-year-old Jodhpur Park resident did not mind the health hazard and drove to the institute — now Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST) — in Shibpur, Howrah, on Saturday to hand over the amount.“With the money we will buy the students who are facing connectivity issues — smartphones and laptops so they can start attending online classes from August 24. The amount will also be spent on developing a digital education hub,” IIEST director Parthasarathi Chakrabarti said.Basu, who had retired from CESC as chief engineer in 1996, visited the campus on Independence Day to sign an MoU with the institute and attend the inauguration of the facility where the digital education hub, named after his mother Sushama Basu, will come up.“Be it for the digital education hub or buying devices, the amount will help students at the time of crisis. It’s good that the institute has taken an inclusive approach so that no one feels left out despite the absence or the poor availability of Internet connectivity,” Basu said.He had promised at the tech school’s global alumni convention in February to donate Rs 1 crore. Saturday’s contribution was the first tranche of the planned donation.“This is the highest contribution from an individualin recent times,” an IIESTofficial said.Basu said the culture of generous contribution from IIT Kharagpur alumni to their alma mater inspired him to make the donation.IIT Bombay was the first to engage the alumni to raise a corpus so that the digital divide could be taken care of. The Bombay institute has raised Rs 1.25 crore to buy its students laptops and broadband facilities.An IIEST official said that initially they had thought Basu’s contribution would be spent on developing hostels and classrooms so they can accommodate the increasing number of students. “But since on-campus activities have ceased because of the pandemic, there is no point investing the amount in these ventures,” the official said.A survey on Net connectivity being conducted by IIEST has so far covered half the students. “As many as 15 per cent of the students surveyed are facing connectivity issues,” director Chakrabarti said.The undergraduate student strength, leaving aside the first year, stands at close to 2,000.The students coping with connectivity issues have been split into three categories. Those who do not have devices such as smartphones and computers are in the first category. In the second are those who possess the devices but live in remote places with poor or limited networks. The third category comprises those who have devices but cannot afford a high-speed data pack.“We will buy the poorstudents the devices. As long as the institute will continue to hold online classes, the students are not required to pay Rs 17,500 as mess advance, Rs 3,000 as mess entrance fee, Rs 1,000 as seat rent and Rs 800 as electricity and water charges. They can buy a high-speed data pack with the saved amount,” said director Chakrabarti.The institute is trying to contact the telecom service providers to help out students who are struggling with poor connectivity at home.The IIEST is a central institute where half the students are from Bengal and the rest from across the country.",2020-08-18 00:55:00

But now the problem has taken a different dimension, said doctors and officials running polyclinics.Many doctors are getting infected by the coronavirus or are being forced to go into quarantine after coming in contact with Covid patients, making them unavailable at clinics. There are others who are working in Covid wards and so are unable to see other patients, many of whom are suffering from chronic ailments and are under regular treatment.Many doctors, however, are attending OPDs at hospitals because they feel safety protocols are better followed there than smaller chambers and clinics.Adding to the patients’ woes, many clinics are giving appointments to only a few in a week because of shortage of space and doctors. Some clinics are still shut because doctors are staying away.Officials of private healthcare institutes said most doctors are attending OPDs and are insisting that their patients go there for consultations. But many patients are reluctant to go to the hospitals because they are scared of getting infected. They prefer to meet their doctors in smaller clinics near their houses.   A woman who is in her 20th week of pregnancy had wanted an appointment with her gynaecologist last week. The doctor told her the polyclinic in south Calcutta where the woman used to go for regular check-ups was closed and asked her to meet him at a hospital off EM Bypass.“Doctors say pregnant women are vulnerable to Covid and so she did not want to go for her check-up at the hospital, where hundreds of Covid patients are admitted. But because the doctor is not seeing patients at the clinic, she is consulting him over the phone,” said a relative of the woman.A 72-year-old woman often suffers from electrolyte imbalance (abnormal levels of sodium and potassium in blood). Whenever the imbalance occurs, her physician gets her admitted to a nursing home, said a relative.Last week, the woman had a similar problem and the doctor was not taking calls. “When her son went to the doctor’s home, he asked him to take the lady somewhere else. He said he was visiting neither the nursing home nor the polyclinic he was attached to,” the relative said.Private hospitals that run polyclinics said several such facilities were still not functioning.The Narayana Health group runs a polyclinic on Sarat Bose Road. “We have opened the clinic but barely 10 per cent doctors are going there and that too for only a couple of days. Also, because of space constraints, we are unable to give appointments to many patients,” said R. Venkatesh, director, eastern region of Narayana Health.The owner of a polyclinic in Narendrapur said barely 50 per cent of the doctors were coming to the clinic because several were affected by Covid-19.Even in some of the clinics where most doctors are turning up, not many patients are being given appointments.“Because of space constraints and to maintain the norms of social distancing, we cannot accommodate every-one at the same time like before. Patients are being asked to sit inside, while those accompanying them have to wait outside for their turns,” said surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay, who is also the secretary of Bengal Oncology Foundation that runs a cancer clinic in south Calcutta.“Because of bad weather during this time of the year, we cannot make so many people wait outside. So, we have restricted the number of appointments,” he said.",2020-08-18 00:56:00
1161,Our Legal Reporter,Calcutta High Court gives parents a week more on school dues - Telegraph India,"Parents who are still to pay at least 80 per cent of their children’s fees in 121 schools that do not have any government financial support will get a week more to clear the dues, the high court ruled on Monday.The court had earlier set August 15 as the deadline to make the payment.A division bench of the court, comprising Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Moushumi Bhattacharya, said the school authorities could not take any coercive steps against students who fail to pay the fees by next week.The court has decided to form a two-member committee to ascertain the income and expenses of schools and the constraints they have supposedly been facing because of parents’ reluctance to pay the fees.Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, will be a member of the committee, the court said.The court asked the state’s advocate-general, Kishore Datta, to nominate an apolitical educationist by Tuesday who would be the committee’s second member.The committee will have the liberty to seek the help of chartered accountants for the job, the division bench said. The committee would be given one week to submit a report before the court.The committee will look into the impact of the long lockdown on a school’s finances.Scores of schools have complained that they are finding it difficult to pay salaries to teachers and other members of the staff because many parents are averse to paying fees. Several schools have pointed out that labs, buses and libraries that are shut now need expensive maintenance for their upkeep.Das told Metro that he was still to receive the court order. “I will see to it that the interest of all stakeholders, students, school authorities, as well as parents, is harmonised and school education moves forward.”The high court was hearing a PIL moved by Vineet Ruia, a social activist, alleging several schools had debarred students from attending online classes and writing online exams because they failed to pay the fees.Ruia had said these private institutions had turned into industries.Some people such as drivers of school vehicles and sweepers had requested the court that they be made a party to the case. They may tell the court about their problems; but they need not be added as parties to the case, the division bench said.",2020-08-18 00:57:00
1162,Snehal Sengupta,Gunshot injury in Salt Lake guest house - Telegraph India,"A middle-aged man from Ludhiana in Punjab was injured after a gun an associate was holding allegedly went off inside a guest house in Salt Lake’s BJ Block late on Sunday, police said.Manpreet Singh, also known as Deepa, was taken to a private hospital in Salt Lake by five men with whom he had come to the city ostensibly to look for a woman from his family, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said. An employee of the guest house accompanied the group to the hospital.The group had allegedly gone around the city for several days in a vehicle with a Punjab registration number looking for the young woman. The police had no whiff of the so-called search mission till an injured Deepa had to be admitted to hospital.The men had taken Deepa to the hospital in a Toyota Innova that bore Punjab registration plates. Those who had accompanied Deepa told the hospital authorities and doctors in the emergency room that he had met with an accident.All but one man left the hospital as soon as Deepa was wheeled inside.“We immediately called the nearest police station as the man had suffered a bullet injury. The bullet had ruptured his abdomen and the right femur bone,” said an official of the hospital.Deepa underwent surgery and was shifted to the intensive care unit.The cops tracked footage of CCTV cameras and questioned the man who stayed back in the hospital and tracked down the vehicle as well as the others to the guest house in BJ Block, an officer of the commissionerate said.The police questioned the men and guest house employees before arresting a driver in the group named Sunny Singh. “Sunny was handling the gun when it went off,” the officer said.Deepa had come to the city with eight others and checked into the Salt Lake guest house on August 12. Of the eight, two are relatives of Singh and the rest are drivers, the officer said.Three of the drivers checked out on August 14.",2020-08-18 01:01:00
1163,Subhajoy Roy,Call to identify heritage precincts in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A group of Calcuttans has written to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to conduct an exercise to identify heritage precincts and help protect from demolition houses that lend a character to a place.A heritage precinct is different from a heritage building. While an individual house can be tagged as a heritage structure, a precinct is a collection of houses on a road that together tell the story of a time, of a place or culture, said an architect who co-authored the proposal sent to the civic body.According to the group behind the move, cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad have heritage precincts but Calcutta has none.Declaring a neighbourhood as a heritage precinct may not mean that demolition of all buildings in the zone will be stopped forever, said Partha Ranjan Das, an architect who is one of those who drafted the proposal.“There are many overlapping laws. I cannot force someone who doesn’t have the ability to maintain a large house not to sell it. But there are other ways to preserve a heritage precinct,” he said.Das added that the government had to create incentives for the owners of buildings in a heritage precinct so that they did not pull them down. If an owner is unable to maintain the property, the government must buy it or act as a facilitator so that someone interested in preserving the house buys it.The initiative to identify heritage precincts in Calcutta was taken up by author and singer Amit Chaudhuri and heritage conservationist G.M. Kapur. During a couple of their meetings with the CMC officials they had raised the issue. Calcutta High Court had asked the CMC to sit with the two following a PIL that objected to the delisting and downgrading of buildings from the CMC’s heritage list.“A heritage precinct is different from a heritage building. It could be that no single building is of any great historical significance but when they are seen together, they represent an unique architectural style or tell the story of a time or tell the story of culture of a people,” said Das.Chaudhuri said that in trying to identify heritage precincts, they were not looking at monuments but houses that gave a place an identity and remained as evidence of various phases of Calcutta’s progress over the years.“If you see a movie from the 60s that depicts the life in Mumbai or London of that time and go to these cities now, you will still find many of those houses intact. But the way things are being demolished in Calcutta, we will soon lose whatever remains. Therefore the need to identify and declare some places of significance as heritage precincts is necessary,” he said.Das cited the example of Southern Avenue, which has many buildings with an art deco architecture, and Bhowanipore, which has many buildings with two courtyards and a verandah. “None of these buildings was inhabited by any luminary, neither did any historical event take place there. But if one walks down the road looking at the buildings, they represent a unique style, time and a culture,” he said.Conservationist Kapur cited the example of Hastings, where roads evoke the feeling of European settlements but the houses have mostly disappeared. “Hastings could have been a heritage precinct if it were preserved,” he rued.The proposal sent to the CMC does not name any place. It calls for a dedicated team that will roam streets and lanes to identify heritage precincts.In July last year, the Calcutta Architectural Legacies (CAL) and Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage had filed a PIL at the high court seeking to know the parameters set by the CMC to downgrade or delist a heritage structure. In November, the court asked the CMC to sit with the litigants and resolve the matter, said CAL founder Chaudhuri.Members of CAL and Intach had raised the issue of absence of heritage precincts in Calcutta during these meetings. “The CMC asked us to give them a proposal. We gave them the proposal on August 10,” said Chaudhuri.",2020-08-19 03:22:00
1164,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: IIT Kharagpur scraps plan to call students to campus - Telegraph India,"IIT Kharagpur has scrapped plans to bring students grappling with poor Internet links at home to the campus so they can attend online classes using the institute’s network, following a spike in Covid cases in Kharagpur and other reasons related to the pandemic.The online classes for the autumn semester will start on September 1. The institute is studying alternative models being tried out by other institutes to help those students overcome the digital divide and take part in online classes, an official said.“The plan to bring students facing poor Net connectivity at home to the campus has been scrapped because of several reasons, including a surge in the number of Covid cases in Kharagpur and its surrounding areas,” Somesh Kumar, the dean of students’ affair, told Metro on Tuesday.  “We are also worried over maintaining physical distancing norms at hostels. Using a common toilet could also pose a serious health risk.”Asked what the institute would do to ensure that those students do not suffer academically, Kumar said: “I believe the authorities will do something to help them.”Another official of the country’s oldest IIT said the authorities were studying various models that other institutes were considering to bridge the digital divide.IIM-Calcutta, too, had planned to bring some students of its two-year MBA programme encountering network problems at home to the campus. The plan had to be shelved because of the pandemic.The B-school is providing the students lacking high-speed data packs with recordings of missed lectures and additional tutorials.The National Institute of Technology (NIT), in Durgapur, headed by a professor from IIT Kharagpur, will conduct an on-campus “crash semester” for students who lack the basic connectivity required to attend online classes.“We are taking feedback about these models to devise a mechanism to help students being affected by the digital divide,” an official of the Kharagpur institute said.A high court division bench headed by Justice Sanjib Banerjee on Tuesday appointed a two-member committee to assess the income and expenditure of 121 non-aided schools. The committee, with Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das and former secretary of state higher secondary education council Gopa Datta as members, will consider the constraints the schools are facing. The court is hearing a plea by parents alleging schools are overcharging them during the Covid pandemic. The panel will have to submit a report by September 7.",2020-08-19 03:38:00
1165,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus lockdown: Digital hole in district schools - Telegraph India,"More than half the students of most state-aided schools outside Calcutta do not have a smartphone, laptop or a computer and are not attending online classes, according to reports submitted by the schools.Many state-aided schools in districts have been conducting classes through Whats-App and email since mid-April, according to a senior official of the school education department. The schools send study materials and notes to students through WhatsApp and email and teachers are supposed to take feedback from the pupils through video calls.The heads of several schools have informed the school education department that more than half their students do not have smart devices and have not beenin touch with the teaching-learning system since online classes started, a school education department official said.A small number of teachers in some schools had taken a personal initiative and reached out to the students with study materials. “The bulk of the students lacking smart devices is completely out of the education system,” said the official.  The school education department had asked all state-aided schools to send reports stating how many students of their institutions had smart devices and were using them to attend online classes.“The reports started arriving on Sunday evening,” an official in the school education department said.The situation is starkly different in Calcutta. Reports from schools in these areas say more than 85 per cent students had been attending online classes regularly and most students have smart devices. At several schools in the city, almost 100 per cent students have the devices and are attending online classes regularly.City-based state-aided schools use WhatsApp, email, Zoom and Google Meet for teaching.The headmistress of a city school that conducts online teaching through WhatsApp and Google Meet cited an example to highlight the level of students’ participation in online teaching: “We have 39 students studying math in Class XII. All 39 attend classes daily.”The report submitted by a school near Madhyamgram, in North 24-Parganas, states that only 57 of the 145 students in classes between V and X have a smartphone, laptop or a computer.The school has 27 students enrolled in Class X.Thirteen have the devices and the remaining 14 students have not attended the classes, though they will be writing Madhyamik next year.Only four out of 26 students in Class V in the institution have a smart device. The remaining 22 students have not been in touch with the school since April.In the same school, out of 23 students in Class VI, only eight have a smart device. In Class VIII, five out of 22 students have smart devices and the rest are not attending the teaching sessions.The report from a school in Diamond Harbour, in South 24-Parganas, states that only 45 of the 97 students in Class V have a smart device at home. Of the 151 students in Class VI, only 61 have such a device at home.The data to be gleaned from the reports is likely to be used to devise strategies if schools can’t be reopened in the next few months.“Around five months have passed since the lockdown was imposed. We still don’t know how long the schools will remain closed. We need to have a proper planning for online classes if the schools remain shut for many more months,” the official said.",2020-08-19 03:40:00
1166,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus lockdown: Free forms drive applicant count - Telegraph India,"Most colleges have seen a jump in the number of applications for admission since they stopped taking application fees, following an advisory from the state government, as many students are now applying for as many subjects as possible.The trend has left many college principals worried that the admission process might be delayed.Students would usually seek admissions for studying honours courses in two or three subjects when they were charged fees for receiving and submitting online forms, the principals of some colleges said.Most colleges would charge Rs 125 to Rs 500 for every subject.Students have been submitting applications for five to seven subjects after the fee waiver was put into effect on August 13 midnight, the principals said.Shiuli Sarkar, the principal of Lady Brabourne College, said the institution had stopped charging students for admission forms and prospectuses after August 13 following the government advisory. “The number of online applications received by the college has increased many times in each subject,” she said.The college, run by the higher education department, used to charge Rs 125 for each form.After the fees were waived, many students with low scores applied for subjects which are in demand. “The demand for some subjects is high. Only students with very high scores would apply for those subjects before,” Sarkar said. This year the college has noticed that even low-scorers are applying for those subjects. A teacher at Asutosh College said that students who had just scored the required marks to be eligible to apply would not apply for the subjects that are in demand. “The trend has changed this year. Even low scorers are applying for the subjects in demand,” the teacher said. The principal of New Alipore College, Jaydeep Sarangi, said that like previous years, the institution had been charging Rs 200 per applicationfrom August 10 till the government advisory was issued. “We received around 500 applications a day on an average between August 10 and 14.We started receiving 750 to 1,000 applications a day after we stopped taking money for the form,” the principal said.The increase in the number of applications is likely to delay the admission process and lead to difficulties in preparing the merit lists, several principals said.Many high-scorers are applying for too many subjects and this can block seats in subjects in demand, according to a principal.“Say a student with high marks applies for seven subjects. She or he manages a berth in five. But the candidate will select only one.The seats in the remaining subjects will remain blocked until she or he surrenders them…. Or, we will have to devise a system to detect such cases immediately. This can delay the admission process,” the principal said. The merit lists will be very long, another principal said.The government had announced on August 13 that universities and colleges would not charge undergraduate aspirants for application forms and prospectuses.The colleges started distributing and receiving online admission forms on August 10. Forms can be submitted till August 26.",2020-08-19 03:42:00
1167,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Parents’ observations in school report cards - Telegraph India,"A city school has decided to include observations of parents in the children’s report cards.Sri Sri Academy will involve parents in the assessment of children because parents are collaborating with teachers in implementing online teaching during the pandemic. The parents’ observations will be part of the reports of the 1,400-odd students from nursery to Class V.For those in middle and senior sections, the school is planning self-assessment by the students with some observations by parents.The school has recently sent a feedback form to the parents of the students in the junior school. The parents have been asked to state whether the children are following the teachers’ instructions and whether they are showing any change in behaviour during this period.“During the pandemic, parents are partnering with the teachers to oversee learning. We felt that if we do notinclude their observations in the report cards, it will be an incomplete report. Teachers cannot make a complete assessment on the basis of what they see online,” said principal Suvina Shunglu.The school says in a note to the parents: “Thank you for being such a pillar of support for us as we navigated our way to newer methods of online teaching during the lockdown... This (the feedback document) will help us understand how your child has advanced through our online teaching sessions.”The feedback form that has been sent to the parents include questions like how the children have reacted to the lockdown and whether they have come to terms with the fact that they cannot go out to play.Other questions include whether children listen to instructions, whether the instructions need to be repeated, whether they are completing their task in an organised manner and whether the parents are helping the children complete the task.The questions have been framed according to age groups and expected learning outcomes, the principal said.The report card also includes observations on social behaviour and work habits, apart from mentioning the numeracy and literacy skills, the school authorities said. “If teachers are not seeing the child in the classroom, how will they judge the child?” Shunglu asked.On online platforms, all children in the class are not visible on the screen always. In in-person teaching, a teacher can observe every child. Observations include how a child is behaving in the class, with peers and on the playground.During online teaching, the video at times gets switched off because of poor connectivity, hampering interactions between teachers and students. Also, to eliminate any background noise, children are asked to keep their devices on mute when the teacher is speaking.For those in middle and senior school, self assessment will be a part of the reports.The students will be asked questions like how much effort they are putting in for online classes and how they think they can improve. “Even after the pandemic, self-assessment can be retained in the reports,” said Shunglu.",2020-08-19 03:52:00
1168,Debraj Mitra,Kolkata weather update: Bay belt triggers ‘widespread rain’ alert - Telegraph India,"A fresh low-pressure belt, brewing over the Bay of Bengal, is tipped to trigger widespread rain in the city on Wednesday.The system, which led to steady showers and a consistent cloud cover on Tuesday, is the third over the Bay of Bengal this month.Monsoon is the season of rain-bearing systems over the Bay. But July, usually the rainiest month of the season, had hardly seen any such system. August has already had a couple and another is in the making, said Met officials.“A low-pressure area is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal by Wednesday. It is very likely to gain strength over the next 24 hours and move westwards gradually. Under its influence, widespread rain is very likely to occur in the districts of south Bengal from August 18 to 20,” said a Met official.“One or two areas in south Bengal could get heavy rain and the coastal areas are likely to see gusts at 45kmph and above.”As the system is tipped to move westwards, districts like West Midnapore, Bankura, Jhargram and Purulia are likely to see more rain on Thursday.A low-pressure area that had formed over the north Bay of Bengal last Thursday led to a wet Independence Day weekend. “The rain was not heavy but typical monsoon rain. It was widespread and persistent rain,” said the Met official.The system has lost strength and was positioned over Chhattisgarh and adjoining areas on Tuesday morning. The back-to-back systems ensured that the monsoon trough remained over south Bengal for much of August.“The trough now passes through Digha to the northeast Bay of Bengal,” said a Met report.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will grant a trade licence to applicants within 24 hours if all documents are in order, a CMC official said on Tuesday. Officials will conduct inspections later and take action if there are any irregularities.",2020-08-19 04:17:00

Details of the account have been provided on the university’s website.The university had conducted a survey among the students of engineering, science and arts faculty recently and found that around 800 students are in need of support.VC Das said that despite some individual initiatives by teachers, regular classes have not been held in the online mode or through electronic means such as email, WhatsApp and Google classroom. “That is because a significant number of our students do not have access to stable high-speed data connections and some students do not even possess handheld devices,” he said.“I feel it is our moral responsibility to provide the students who do not possess a smartphone with a smartphone and to offer financial assistance to those students who need it to upgrade their data connectivity. I am sure everyone will agree that the adoption of these measures is required to address the challenge of the digital divide.”The students will have to return the smartphones to the university on completion of their courses.In an appeal posted on the JU website, Das has written: “I am sure the university’s faculty members will join hands to help our students and ensure that none of them is deprived of the access to academic activities during a period when normal classes cannot be conducted. This will be in the finest traditions of Jadavpur University, where we work together as a family in our continuing quest to provide our students with an education that combines excellence with equity.”The university earlier this month had advised the teachers to come up with models on how to start classes.The teachers suggested that study materials — notes, soft copies of textbooks, powerpoint presentations, and audio and video lectures — be delivered to the students through email and WhatsApp.“But at JU, a substantial number of students are from poor families. They lack smartphones or a high-speed data pack. So, we also proposed that a special fund be created,” said Partha Pratim Roy, the general secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association.",2020-08-19 04:23:00

Investigators said it was only in the first week of June that his son Anurag Agarwal, who lives in an apartment nearby, came to know that someone had withdrawn Rs 34.90 lakh from his father’s bank account after his death.Rita Roy, 45, the domestic help, and her son-in-law and another relative have been arrested. Police said the ATM card she had allegedly stolen from the house was in a wallet, which also had a piece of paper on which the PIN was written.“The deceased person’s son had gone abroad for a while. After returning, he checked his father’s mobile phone and his bank account and discovered that the money had been withdrawn between March 20 and May 30,” said an officer of the detective department.The police found that at least 30 ATM transactions were made to withdraw the cash from ATM kiosks in Karimpur, Krishnagar and Ranaghat in Nadia and Hooghly districts, sources said.Investigators collected CCTV footage from the ATM kiosks and spotted two men withdrawing money in all footage.

1175,Sanjay Mandal,"Most patients helpless on hospital deposit, pledge to clear final bill  - Telegraph India","A private hospital in Calcutta admitted 50 patients on Tuesday and Wednesday and asked for Rs 50,000 as advance payment from each.Only one patient could pay the amount, while 18 paid much less. The rest expressed their inability to pay during admission but promised to pay in full at the time of discharge.The data showed how patients are inconvenienced if a hospital insists on Rs 50,000 as advance at the time of admission.The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has issued an advisory allowing private hos-pitals to take a deposit of up to Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated treatment cost, whichever is less, during admission.The advisory also states that if a patient is unable to pay instantly, the hospital has to admit him or her but the amount has to be paid within 12 hours. If a patient fails to pay up within that time, the hospital can ask that the bed be vacated within an hour.The chief executive of the private hospital that admitted 50 patients on Tuesday and Wednesday said none of them was shifted because their families had promised to pay during the course of treatment.“Several patients told us they would not pay because they had cashless insurance policies,” said the CEO, who declined to be quoted by name. Eighteen of the patients paid between Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000, he said.“Some of them, Covid-19 patients, had come alone to get admitted. When our staff asked them for deposits, they said they had come to the hospital with whatever cash they had at home at that time,” said the CEO.“Their family members,  who did not come to the hospital but are in touch with us over the phone, said they were too hassled at that moment to arrange for more money.”The CEO added relatives of these patients had promised to pay the entire treatment cost before discharge.Some of those who could not pay at the time of admission said they did not have enough cash at home and had hurried to the hospital after testing positive for Covid-19.“At least one of these patients had severe symptoms and is admitted in the intensive care unit. Such patients don’t come to the hospital with credit or debit cards,” said the CEO.Asked why they were insisting on Rs 50,000, and not on 20 per cent of the estimated cost, the CEO said it was almost impossible to guess how expensive the treatment of a Covid patient with symptoms could be. “Such estimates can be given for someone who will undergo planned surgery,” he said.There have been allegations against several hospitals that they are asking for huge deposits and refusing to admit patients if their demand is not met.Public health experts point out saving a life is most important.“True, money is needed for treatment, but that should not be a pre-condition for access to healthcare, especially during a pandemic such as the one we are going through,” said a public health professional.A person testing positive for the coronavirus disease is usually under immense emotional and psychological pressure. Such people often don’t have instant access to adequate money.“We are asking for Rs 50,000 from each patient coming for admission, in accordance with the recent advisory of the regulatory commission. But few patients can pay the amount upfront. So we are taking whatever they are paying and admitting them,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital.Other hospitals, too, said patients during the pandemic were coming without much cash and are unable to pay Rs 50,000.“Most of these patients who come to the emergency do not carry money with them. So they are asked to deposit a small amount based on their immediate ability, which generally is between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000. We follow them up with daily estimate of charges and provisional bills,” said R. Venkatesh, director, eastern region of Narayana Health, which runs the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.Calcutta: Calcuttans stocked up on groceries and packed refrigerators with ready-to-eats ahead of two consecutive days of “complete lockdown”.Except essential service personnel and people in emergencies, no one will be allowed outside between 6am and 10pm on Thursday and Friday. Even food stores and milk booths will be closed.Biswajit Saha, who runs a mom-and-pop store on Hindusthan Road, had sold 40 litres of milk more than he usually does. Around 7.30pm, he was lamenting he could have sold at least 120 litres more had he got the arithmetic right. “One man who buys two pouches took home 10 today,” Saha said.Many are worried about supplies on Saturday morning as well. Milk may or may not be there this Saturday but banks will be closed. The two-day lockdown means four consecutive bank holidays.There were longer queues outside ATMs across the city on Wednesday, amid apprehension that they may not be refilled over the weekend. The manager of a nationalised bank said his bank had refilled all their ATMs.The pharmacies were crowded as were liquor stores.Exemptions during the lockdown include health services, medicine stores, police stations, courts, jails, electricity and conservancy services, cooked food delivery services, newspapers and electronic media. Police teams across the city used loudhailers and microphones to announce the lockdown dates and rules.Officers in Gariahat said the market was unusually crowded on Wednesday and they had to announce again and again the need to maintain the social distancing rule.On Wednesday, several elderly citizens were seen queuing up outside a nationalised bank near Behala Chowrasta around 11.30am.As only four visitors were being allowed inside, the queue kept extending.

1176,Meghdeep Bhattacharyya ,Lockdown: CESC ready with revised June bills - Telegraph India,"CESC on Wednesday said it had revised the bills for June and would send them out with an explanation of the method of calculation printed on them.Only those consumers who  have not already paid the earlier bills are expected to pay the revised ones.The announcement by the private power utility came almost a month after the Mamata Banerjee government had on July 20 advised consumers aggrieved over their bills against paying the amount and asked them to wait for revised bills.The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group-owned utility — which enjoys a virtual monopoly over 33 lakh consumers across 567sq km in Calcutta and its surrounding areas — also decided to “keep in abeyance” the dues for March, April and May, after hundreds of consumers cried foul over “absurdly high” bills.The utility is yet to offer any clarity on what it would do with the sum kept in abeyance, except for the amount in June.“Let’s keep in focus that this (the reconsideration) was done only by us as a consumer-friendly initiative. There have been parallels in other parts of the country, but nobody else tried doing what we are doing,” said Debasish Banerjee, CESC managing director (distribution).The revised bills will be accompanied by a cover letter, in which CESC will explain the situation to the consumers.The bills for June, issued in July, became the subject of countless jokes and memes on social media, with numerous notable civil society members joining in.Prior to the rethink, the utility had been repeatedly asserting that the bills were based on actual meter readings and it had adjusted them with the previous ones drawn up on an average of the past six months because the lockdown had disrupted meter readings.The average on which the past bills were drawn up was based on power consumption in the winter months, when air-conditioners and fans were not in use.According to Banerjee’s estimates, the revised June bill would be a fraction of the total units consumed since March or April.“For instance, if the total units consumed in the four months from March were 1,000 units, then we are placing each month’s consumption at 250 units…. The 250 units for June is all the consumer will have to pay for in the revised bill, in this example,” he said.“Those who have already paid the previously issued June bill need not pay anything. The necessary adjustment for their payment made towards units presently kept in abeyance will be given subsequently. They too will not be denied of the benefit.”Sources in the state government said the utility’s management started taking the measures after pressure intensified through calls from the “highest possible level” of the government.Power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and Trinamul Congress’s de facto Number Two Abhishek Banerjee had issued statements, claiming credit, after the matter  was picked up for agitation by not only all prominent non-Trinamul parties but also apolitical fora.The July protests were the second instance in two months when CESC faced the ruling establishment’s — and people’s — rage. The earlier one was in May when CESC was unable for around a week to restore normality to some pockets after Cyclone Amphan had caused havoc.In the wake of Amphan, Mamata repeatedly underscored that her government had nothing to do with the monopoly that was granted to the utility three decades ago.“CESC had claimed to the government that absurdly high bills were few and far between and an aberration,” a senior state minister said.“Nobody was questioning CESC for bills issued for higher than usual consumption in middle-income and high-income households during the lockdown months. A bill including the dues for those months would naturally be much higher. But bills with astronomical amounts, especially for low-income households with no ACs or other heavy appliances, simply cannot be justified,” said a senior minister.",2020-08-20 01:19:00

1178,Subhankar Chowdhury,IIT Kharagpur appeal after student tests positive - Telegraph India,"The IIT Kharagpur authorities have asked the 300-odd students still on the campus to move out by August 23 after a student tested positive for Covid-19, officials said.An official of the institute said the student who tested positive was being treated at a Calcutta hospital. His condition is stable.Those who came in contact with the infected student have been asked to get themselves tested at BC Roy Technology Hospital on the campus. “They will undergo the rapid antigen test at the campus hospital,” the official said.The 300-odd students who could not leave the campus because of lack of transport options in the middle of the pandemic are sharing three hostels.In a notice sent to the wardens, the dean of students’ affairs, Somesh Kumar, said: “In view of a Covid-19 case detected in one of the halls and since the student has taken dinner in the private mess, we were compelled to seal all the halls of residence.”The notice says: “All students who are presently staying in the campus must vacate the halls latest by August 23... and proceed to their hometowns.”Of the 3,200-odd students of the institute, only about 300 are still on the campus. The rest vacated the hostels by June 20, in compliance with a notice issued on June 10.Some of the 300-odd are from remote areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Jammu.

1179,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Garden high international initiative to encourage reading - Telegraph India,"A school has developed a library curriculum for students during the Covid pandemic to encourage them to read more.Garden High International School has introduced the curriculum in July, as part of which students from Class VIII to XII are being given a genre each month and they are picking books from the collection at home, downloading them from the Net or having links to e-books sent by the school.The reading is followed by discussions, quizzes, skits like inviting a character to dinner. A Class VIII student invited Rusty after reading Ruskin Bond’s Room on the Roof and had a conversation with him and a Class X student picked up the Avoxes from The Hunger Games to make a film on.They will also have an assessment each month and the grade awarded for that will be reflected in report cards. Remarks from the library-in-charge will feature, too, in the report cards.“Why should students focus only on subjects that they will appear for in the boards. They have to read, differentiate between genres, prepare for research and learn to independently access information,” said Anuradha Das, the director of Garden High International School.But the school does not want to take away the joy of reading and hence evaluation will be about book reviews, audio and video presentation.“The activities have to engage the child and not be cliches or such that they can do after reading the synopsis and not the book,” said Anuradha Ganguly, manager, resources and library systems.Each month till May next year will be dedicated to a different genre from classics, war stories or even band books and every class is given a library period once a week.The curriculum — designed by Das, Ganguly and Nandini Mukherjee, the dean of students — also includes library orientation, readiness, learning about bibliography, citation and ethics and plagiarism.The school’s library has 19,000 books comprising fiction, non-fiction and reference books. The library is the “heart” of the school, according to Indranath Guha, the chairman of Satikanta Guha Foundation, which runs Garden High International and two other schools.“If students and teachers make a requisition of a book which is not available, the school buys it if it is worthy to be in the library,” said Das. “We had to think about how we could include the library in our online classes. When the situation normalises we will pick up things that we introduced during this period and bring it in our physical classrooms.”The school feels it will introduce boys and girls to research and the age for doing research is also going down.Das said earlier students would do research only in masters or graduation but now in some of the  international curriculum even high school students are expected to do research.“It’s not that all students do not read. But even those who read they flounder when they have to do research and hence we want to prepare them for it also,” said Ganguly.",2020-08-20 01:23:00

He tried to run away but the woman gave him a chase.Seeing her run after the man, shopkeepers and passersby came to her aid and caught the man, an officer of the Electronics Complex police station said.An officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said a police team, alerted by the woman’s cries, rushed to the site and detained the man.The woman then went to the police station and filed the complaint. Halder was arrested based on the complaint.The woman, who works in an BPO, alleged that the cops asked her a lot of “intriguing questions” and asked her to narrate the incident several times and also to rewrite her complaint repeatedly.“It was quite humiliating and I felt extremely bad as the personnel at the police station seemed reluctant to lodge the complaint,” the woman said.An officer of the commissionerate, however, said she had been asked to rewrite her complaint as the incident was not clear. “We tried to help her in every possible way. A lady officer attended to her all through,” said the officer.Halder has been charged under various sections of the IPC, including 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).

None of these places had any such directory before.Senior state government officials said the directories would be distributed to the highrise buildings soon.RWAs have emerged as a crucial enabler in the fight against the Covid pandemic and officials said the availability of such directories would help the associations consult each other during crisis.The directories will have phone numbers of police stations, councillors and health department helplines, which the associations can call during an emergency, a senior state government official said on Wednesday.“The RWAs will have phone numbers of important government establishments that can be of help in fighting Covid-19. Similarly, the booklets also make available the contact details of the RWAs to the police stations and civic officials,” a state government official said.The secretary of an RWA in south Calcutta said consulting other condominiums on how to deal with an issue, such as allowing visitors or dumping garbage, would be very helpful. The directories, she said, will make it easier for the associations to contact police or other departments.The distribution of the directories to highrise buildings and various government establishments will start soon.The directories for Calcutta, Salt Lake, New Town and Howrah were released on Wednesday at the CMC headquarters.“There are many elderly people who live in these gated communities but their children live in other cities or abroad.

1182,Subhajoy Roy,Desun Hospital asked to deposit Rs 10 lakh - Telegraph India,"The state clinical establishment commission has asked Desun Hospital to deposit Rs 10 lakh while dealing with a complaint that a Covid-19 patient died because the hospital refused to treat her as her family was unable to pay an initial deposit of Rs 3 lakh.The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, which passed the order on Wednesday, also directed Desun to not take any advance payment from a patient before admission.“Ideally, Desun’s licence should have been cancelled for this. But many patients are getting treated there and we do not want to take such a step. We have asked the hospital to deposit Rs 5 lakh by Tuesday. They have to deposit another Rs 5 lakh within another two weeks,” said retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairman of the commission.“We have also asked Desun to not take any advance payment as deposit while admitting Covid-19 patients. This order is applicable only on Desun Hospital and not other private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients.”But there will be no bar on accepting payment for the bill raised for treatment at the hospital, he clarified.The commission had earlier issued an advisory that private hospitals could take up to Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated treatment cost, whichever is lower, as advance payment from Covid-19 patients.A 60-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid died on August 10 allegedly while waiting in an ambulance outside Desun Hospital for over an hour. The woman’s son had alleged that the hospital refused to admit her despite repeated pleas because the family could not pay Rs 3 lakh immediately as initial deposit.The son told Metro on Wednesday that his mother lay in the ambulance outside the hospital from 9pm to 10.30pm. “I will be happy if the commission is able to force all hospitals to start treatment without waiting for any initial deposit. I do not want anyone else to suffer what my mother had to suffer,” he said.Tapas Banerjee, a senior official of Desun Hospital, told this newspaper on Wednesday that they were yet to get a copy of the order. “No one is above law. We will abide by the law,” he said.The commission asked Desun, the woman’s family and the hospital from where she was transferred to file affidavits. “The hospital where the woman was initially admitted before she tested positive for Covid-19 had some responsibilities, too. They should have stabilised the woman’s condition before asking the family to shift her,” the  commission chairman said.Anandaloke licence off Banerjee said the commission had decided to cancel the licence of all units of Anandaloke Hospital as it had declined to pay Rs 2 lakh to a complainant. The commission had awarded a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the complainant about a year ago.But the hospital paid only Rs 1 lakh. “Anandaloke officials recently informed the commission that it would not be able to pay the remaining amount and so we have decided to cancel the license of the hospital. We have communicated our decision to the state health department,” Banerjee said on Wednesday.The Telegraph could not reach any official of the hospital for a comment.",2020-08-20 01:30:00

The vehicle fled Kankurgachi leaving the sergeant bleeding.The police said he suffered a fracture in the shoulder.Hours later, the car was tracked down to Parnasree in Behala. The two men - Akash Halder, 24, a resident of a highrise in Behala, and Titash Mitra, 33, from Basudevpur Road in Parnasree – were arrested.A preliminary investigation suggests that the Toyota Corolla Altis belonged to Mitra but Halder was at the wheel when it knocked down the sergeant.Both have been booked for attempt to murder, rash and negligent driving and common intention and also under the Disaster Management Act.“Neither could give a reasonable explanation for violating the lockdown. They should have stopped at the first crossing. Instead, they tried to flee and when the message to stop this car was aired so that the vehicle could be intercepted at the next crossing, the vehicle sped past that cordon too,” said a senior police officer.“Not stopping at one crossing could be a mistake, but repeating the same at the next crossing and physically hurting someone amounts to a serious offence,” the officer added.Hundreds of policemen were on the roads on Thursday to enforce the lockdown. Friday, too, is a complete lockdown from 6am to 10pm.Rain, the men in uniform and Covid scare managed to keep people indoors on Thursday.Vehicles across the city were stopped to ask why they were outside.At the Shyambazar crossing, around 2pm, a man driving a private car said he was on his way home after dropping a doctor at his workplace but could not produce any documents and was prosecuted.",2020-08-21 01:47:00
1186,Sanjay Mandal,Covid: Survey to identify at-risk Calcuttans - Telegraph India,"The state government will conduct a survey in Calcutta to find out the extent of co-morbidities in the city's population because such people are vulnerable to Covid-19, officials said.As asked by the state government, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will send teams to houses across 144 wards in the city to ask residents whether they suffer from medical conditions listed as co-morbidities. The conditions include hypertension, diabetes, cardiac diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer and tuberculosis.According to the state health department, Covid-19 has claimed 2,634 lives in Bengal till Thursday. As many as 2,316 of the victims — 87.9 per cent — suffered from co-morbidities.State government and CMC officials decided at a recent meeting that the civic body would send teams to as many houses as possible to prepare a list of people suffering from co-morbidities, a government official said.“More than 2,000 workers of the CMC will be involved in the survey, which should be over in three weeks to one month,” the official said.Once the database is created, people suffering from co-morbidities will be asked to inform the authorities about any symptoms of Covid-19.“We have seen that many people with co-morbidities and symptoms of Covid-19 like fever and respiratory distress did not go for a test till their conditions became critical. The survey is aimed at preventing such delays. Health workers will reach these people proactively and ask them whether they have any Covid symptoms,” a health department official said.He, however, admitted that it might not be possible to reach every household and identify all people with pre-existing conditions. “But even if a percentage of such people could be identified, that would help save many lives,” he said.According to the official, when a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, such a database could be used to prioritise the list of beneficiaries.A study conducted in Birbhum that showed non-communicable diseases to be the leading cause of mortality in the district could serve as a model for the new study. That study, conducted between 2012 and 2017, had recorded 2,320 deaths during the period. Over half the deaths were attributed to non-communicable diseases such as cardiac ailments, cerebral strokes and ischemic heart diseases.The study, authored by Rajesh Kumar Rai, senior research scientist at the Society for Health and Demographic Surveillance; Wafaie W. Fawzi, Richard Saltonstall Professor of Population Sciences at the department of global health and population, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health; and Prashant Mathur, director, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research, Bangalore, among others, concluded: “NCDs (non-communicable diseases) are the leading cause of death among adults in a select population of rural Birbhum. Health programmes for rural India should prioritize plans to mitigate deaths due to NCDs.”“We wanted to highlight the importance of identifying and protecting the population with co-morbidities,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, member of the expert committee on Covid set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee and a co-author of the study.",2020-08-21 01:52:00

The statement warns of a “rise in water level in different rivers of south Bengal and water-logging in city and suburban areas”.Between Wednesday and Thursday evening, the Alipore Met office recorded around 60mm of rain in Alipore. Dark clouds hovered over the city sky since Thursday morning and the rain came in multiple spells.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s measuring station at New Market recorded 55mm of rain in 24 hours from 6.30pm on Wednesday. The corresponding figures at Jora Bridge (Santoshpur) and Joka were 60mm and 49mm, respectively.In Met parlance, 60mm of rain or more in 24 hours qualifies as heavy rain.The roads were deserted on Thursday because of the lockdown. Friday is expected to be similar. But people stepping out next week will face problems if the rain persists.“If the rain continues, several low-lying pockets of the city could be flooded,” said a civic official.Tarak Singh, a member of the board of administrators of the civic body who is in charge of drainage, said: “We can drain out 12mm of water in an hour. But if the rain is heavy and persistent, there is little we can do.”",2020-08-21 02:04:00
1189,Debraj Mitra,Covid: Livelihood trauma for Kolkata bar employees - Telegraph India,"Till March, a 38-year-old man used to stir martinis and rustle up mojitos at a Theatre Road pub.For the past few months, the out-of-work Barrackpore resident has been scrambling to get a job. That includes trying in vain for a guard’s job at a housing complex.A 23-year-old man from Hind Motor had joined a Camac Street bar earlier this year after a short stint at a Park Street café. After a hotel management diploma, he had done a professional bartending course and liked to call himself a “mixologist”. His salary of “Rs 16,000” was a glimmer of hope for his parents, who had paid through their nose for his courses.Since April, the youth is “on furlough”. The pandemic has not only dashed the family’s hopes but posed a serious challenge in meeting daily expenses.The bar shutdown because of the Covid pandemic has robbed many Calcuttans of their weekend fun. But for thousands of people, it means loss of livelihood and an uncertain future for their families. Behind the tinkling of glasses, psychedelic lights and trippy music, these places also provided bread and butter to many families.“I have been working as a bartender for close to a decade. There is hardly anything else I can do. But I cannot sit at home, whimpering. I have to do something. I have not been able to pay my daughter’s school fees for the past two months,” said the Barrackpore resident.His wife is a homemaker. His daughter studies in Class XI. The man used to get a salary of Rs 22,000. He said he had not been paid anything since the pub downed shutters in March.The Telegraph spoke to many such people. They have lost their jobs or are on unpaid leave or furlough. A few lucky ones have been getting a small part of their salary.Most of the people this newspaper spoke to requested anonymity. They feared revealing their names would jeopardise the chances of getting back to work when the situation improved, as promised by several owners.The owners said they were struggling to stay afloat. Rent licence fees and other fixed cost components are continuing to deplete their coffers. Their revenue has been zero since March.“What options am I left with? I have to pay a huge rent even when the place is shut. I have to renew my excise license, trade and fire licences,” said a young bar owner, who has been “forced” to cut jobs and send employees on unpaid leave.The “uncertainty” is most disturbing, the owners said, especially when retail liquor shops have reopened. When the curbs were first imposed, they thought the shutdown would be short. Many bar owners did not go for layoffs or furloughs for initial months. But the prolonged ban on bars has left them with no other option, said the owners.“Had we known the burnout, it would have been easy to calculate our losses and go ahead. Gradually, all other businesses are opening up, except bars,” said the owner of a microbrewery that has remained shut.The lid on bottles has also affected revenue and footfall at some of the traditional favourite restaurants on Park Street, forcing owners to reduce staff strength.“If I am allowed to serve fresh lime soda on a table, what is the problem in serving a bottle of beer,” asked the owner of a Park Street bar-cum-restaurant.An informal association of bartenders in Calcutta has been trying to raise funds for out-of-work bar employees. “We have over 120 members. But thousands of bar employees are out of work,” said a member of the association.Sagar Daryani, the chapter head of the National Restaurants Association of India in Calcutta, said the number of places that served alcohol in the city would be over 1,000. “The lives of tens of thousands of people are at stake.” he said.",2020-08-21 02:09:00
1190,Debraj Mitra,Two workers at Alipore zoo electrocuted - Telegraph India,"Two men, part of a group of labourers putting up hoardings at the Alipore zoo, were electrocuted on Thursday morning.A third was injured and is in hospital. An official of the hospital said his condition was critical.The deceased have been identified as Tarani Ghosh, 31, from Murshidabad, and Pradip Das, 45, from Odisha.The men were electrocuted around 11.30am, opposite the elephant enclosure. The chain of events leading to the deaths was not immediately clear.The group had been camping on the zoo premises for several days, said zoo officials. “Continuous process industries and industries with in-house workers” are exempt from the lockdown curbs, according to the state government guidelines.The team was working for a contractor, who had been hired by an outdoor advertising agency, sources at the park said. “The labourers were electrocuted while doing some maintenance work. Two of them were declared brought dead at the hospital. The third is undergoing treatment,” a police officer said.An official of the Delhi-based outdoor agency said: “From what I have gathered, the men were not erecting a hoarding on Thursday. The accident happened when they were collecting materials lying on the ground….”Asked if safety protocols were followed, the official said: “It is not possible for us to keep tabs on the minute details of every project. The contractor had hired the men.”The zoo is shut for visitors because of the pandemic. Only a handful of keepers and guards are now engaged, mostly for daily maintenance.“There was no keeper or guard at the spot at the time of the incident,” zoo director Asis Kumar Samanta said. “I was alerted around noon. The men were shifted to hospital immediately on a zoo vehicle.”“We have started a probe into the incident,” said VK Yadav, member-secretary, Bengal Zoo Authority.“Electrical engineers will visit the spot tomorrow to find out how the labourers came in contact with a live wire,” said a zoo official.“Prime facie, it seems to be a case of electrocution. The zoo authorities will conduct their own probe,” a police officer said. Asked why the police were not registering a case of negligence suo moto, the officer said: “Someone has to first allege there was negligence.”",2020-08-21 02:14:00
1191,Subhankar Chowdhury, Jadavpur University to conduct digital classes to clear backlog - Telegraph India,"Jadavpur University will conduct regular classes through “distance digital mode” from August 23 so that students of the intermediate semester can be compensated for the classes they had missed out on in the previous semester because of the lockdown.Half the classes of the previous semester could not be held because the campus had to be shut down as a precaution against Covid-19.The compensatory classes will be held for arts and science students. As for the engineering students, the date of commencement of such classes will be decided later.“Ahead of the start of the classes of the next semester from September 14, the teachers will hold classes through distance digital mode so that the students could make up for the classes they had missed,” said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.An official said in the “distance digital mode”, study materials such as notes, soft copies of textbooks, and audio and video demonstrations would be made available to the students through email and WhatsApp.After a student goes through the study materials, he or she will get an opportunity to interact with the teacher concerned through email or WhatsApp to clear doubts. Teachers can form sub-groups of students and engage with each through conference calls to clear doubts.“Since making a conference call does not require any Internet connectivity on the handheld device, we want to apply this model,’’ said Partha Pratim Roy, an associate professor of physics department.The university is raising funds to provide smartphones and high-speed data packs to 800-odd students who have poor Net connectivity at home, so they can attend classes from September 14. Will these students be left out of the compensatory classes?“It is unlikely they could be given the devices or data packs before August 23. We have left it to the teachers to decide how to reach out to the students,” said VC Das. “If nothing can be done, then additional classes should be held for these students when they will be handed the devices and the data pack.”",2020-08-21 02:21:00
1192,Monalisa Chaudhuri,‘Safe’ lamp post kills two in Shibpur  - Telegraph India,"Two men returning home after a dip in the Hooghly were electrocuted near the botanical garden in Shibpur on Thursday afternoon after they came in contact with a lamp post barely seven hours after a CESC team inspected it following a complaint and declared it safe.People in the neighbourhood said the technician in the CESC team told them there was no fault in the post and that some of the branches of an overhanging tree, in which wires were entangled, needed to be pruned. No one turned up to trim the tree.Residents said Suman Sharma and Srikanta Das, both in their 30s, might not have died had the branches been pruned in time.They said the wires were lying entangled with branches for a long time and caused a huge spark and sound that prompted one of them to register a complaint with CESC on Thursday morning.Officials of the utility said they received a complaint about a loud sound in a post around 6.30am and a team went to inspect the spot but did not find any fault. “There was a need for trimming of some branches for which an internal team was alerted,” the CESC spokesperson said. “But it started raining heavily after that (the morning inspection) and the place got waterlogged.”Officials in the Howrah Municipal Corporation said they had not received any requisition from the power utility for trimming the tree.Asked to respond, the CESC spokesperson said: “As no fault was found during the inspection in the morning, there was no reason to rush for the trimming as well.”The spokesperson also said the tree trimming was not related to the electrocution. “There are several wires that run through trees across the city. Then all the wires could have caused electrocution.”Around 1pm, Sharma and Das accidentally came in touch with the lamp post outside a government quarters while trying to negotiate the waterlogged lane. Both got electrocuted and were declared dead at the Howrah State General Hospital, police said.An unnatural death case has been started by AJC Bose Botanic Garden police station. “We have not received any specific complaint till now,” said a police officer late on Thursday.CESC officials said soon after the incident was reported in the afternoon, their team had re-visited the spot and switched off the supply line. “Necessary investigation to find the cause of the incident is on,” the CESC spokesperson said.The need to trim a tree with entangled power lines and the lack of action would ring a familiar alarm bell for many Calcuttans.After Cyclone Amphan had hit the city on May 20, Metro had published several reports on how lack of coordination between the linemen and the authorities responsible for trimming or removing uprooted trees was hurting the efforts to clear the debris left by the storm.CESC wanted the trees removed first and the tree removers wanted the power lines checked and the area declared safe first.In May, a young fireman was electrocuted in Belur while trying to saw the branches off a partially uprooted tree that had got entangled in electrical wires, allegedly after CESC had told his team that the supply to the area had been cut off. The death of the fireman had prompted a revised protocol among fire officials that they would not cut trees after a power cut, unless a technician of the power supply agency tests the line himself and declares it safe.The place where the incident happened on Thursday is frequented by hundreds of morning walkers. It was deserted on Thursday because of the lockdown.After the deaths, residents demanded “stern action” against the technician who had first visited the spot in the morning. Morning walkers demanded compensation for the families of the dead.",2020-08-21 02:25:00
1193,TT Bureau,New Town: 3-day fest promotes cycling - Telegraph India,"Three cycling events were held between August 13 and 15 in New Town in a bid to promote cycling as a means of last mile connectivity in the township.The first event was exclusively for women. They took a ride from the business club to the clock tower. On the second day, a mixed group comprising mostly men rode a much long distance from the clock tower to the Eiffel Tower in Eco Park and on Independence Day two independent groups rode and culminated their rides in the township.“The events may seem one-off but they are part of a well-thought out strategy,” said Debashis Sen, chairman cum managing director of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) and chairman of New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA). “Our aim is to lure residents away from using buses and totos for last-mile connectivity and switch to bicycles.”The all-women ride was introduced for gender balance. “We noted that elderly women, particularly, would be reluctant riding in a mixed group. One lady who turned up said she was riding after 25 years, another straight after her school days… Response was positive,” said Sen.The authorities are also planning to teach cycling to those interested. “These steps are required to change people’s attitude. At present many believe cycles are for those who cannot afford anything else. Parents forbid their children from cycling for fear of road accidents. So we are expanding our cycle track network, asking them to use service lanes and building an ecosystem conducive to cycling,” he said.He added that the sale of cycles had risen during the lockdown. “One large housing complex has informed me that over the past month or two 300 new bicycles have been purchased by their residents,” said Sen.Namrata Bhatta, a resident of Mahishgot, adjoining New Town participated in the event with her two sons, aged 10 and 8. “I am a Baidyabati girl. In our growing-up years, cycle was the preferred mode of transport for all of us. We would think nothing of cycling five-six kilometres daily.”Though she left her cycle back in her Hooghly district home after shifting to New Town post-marriage, she is now planning to bring it over.“My sons had a cycle but did not ride it much. This event has created such a craze that they are cycling on their own even now that the event is over,”  said the lady on Wednesday.She had borrowed her neighbour’s cycle for the event, she added.",2020-08-21 19:05:00
1194,Snehal Sengupta,Blame it on Rajarhat - Telegraph India,"Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation has about Rs 160 crore in property taxes arrears. This astronomical sum has accrued over the last four years, when residents failed to paid their dues. The authorities, however, blame Rajarhat for the chunk of it.Money received as property tax is used to provide civic services like streetlights, road repairs, water supply and solid waste management but several councilors and mayoral council members said that due to the accrued taxes, several development projects, including healthcare services, in the corporation could not be undertaken.Lack in Covid care facility“Had we managed to collect the taxes properly and on time, we could have started a hospital for Covid-19 patients that could also have started testing people living in the corporation area,” said a mayoral council member who did not wish to be named.At present, the corporation has three medical facilities — Matri Sadan Hospital in EE Block,  Vidyasagar Matro Sadan in Narayanpur and a third in Deshbandhu Nagar. None of these hospitals is now admitting Covid-19 patients.Matri Sadan Hospital has, in fact, been shut for the past few years and has not been thrown open to patients despite a Rs 1.25 crore revamp.Dark streetsAccording to a mayoral council member, several areas in Salt Lake are plunging into darkness after sundown due to dysfunctional streetlights. “If we had money in our coffers we would have repaired our lights,” said the councillor.Several roads in Salt Lake, including the First Avenue, parts of the Broadway and roads inside blocks, are in bad shape. “Tenders for road repairs have not even been called as there is no money at hand,” said another Salt Lake councillor.A contractor who undertakes road repairs said that the civic body was yet to clear its dues for work that has already been completed. “We are still waiting for our last payments,” he said.Tax bills sentOf the total pending amount, Rs 150 crore is receivable from homes under the erstwhile Rajarhat Gopalpur Municipality like Kestopur, Baguiati, Kaikhali and Teghoria. Rajarhat alone has more than 1.17 lakh holdings as opposed to only 26,000 in Salt Lake.
Mayor Krishna Chakraborty said they had already initiated tax collections and that tax bills would soon reach all corners of the corporation.“We have started sending out bills and have received assurances from several housing complexes in Kaikhali and Teghoria, who have outstanding taxes to the tune of a few crores, that they will pay up,” she said.
But a mayoral council member said that in reality very little effort was being made to collect taxes from these areas. “We are extending all services to these places but not receiving any taxes in return. Without money we cannot buy new equipment or launch new projects,” he said.Deputy mayor Tapas Chatterjee said that holdings in Rajarhat need to be reassessed for updated tax rates. “The area had a different tax structure as part of the erstwhile Rajarhat Goplapur Municipality. But now it needs to be reassessed as it is part of the corporation,” said Chatterjee, who was earlier the chairman of the Rajarhat Gopalpur Municipality.Ward by wardIn Salt Lake the scenario differs from ward to ward. Devasish Jana, councillor of Ward 34 that includes blocks IB, HB, GD, GE, FE, FF and IC, said that taxes amounting to at least a couple of crores were due. “I have sent all the tax bills with a request to residents to clear them at the earliest,” said Jana, who is also the mayoral council member of solid water management in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.Anindya Chatterje, the councillor of Ward 41 that encompasses blocks AA, AB, AC, AD, BA, BB, BC and BD, said that around Rs 12 crore was due from these areas. “I have gone around the ward personally delivering tax bills to residents who have large sums pending. Several of them have said they would pay up. Others said they felt the received was too high and would like a review.”In such a case they are to send an application to the corporation seeking review. A mayoral council member even mentioned instances where residents have queued up to pay taxes but the civic body could not accept payment as the assessment procedure was not clear to resdients.Chairperson of the civic body and the councillor of Ward 30, Anita Mondal, too has been visiting AG, AH, BG, BH, CG and DG blocks to hand deliver bills. “At least 35 residents have handed over cheques since then. Most came to the ward office for it. We expect payments to be faster once the pandemic is over,” she said.Then there are those like Rajesh Chirimar, councillor of Ward 39 (including wards like blocks like CA, DA, DB), who say that most residents have already paid up. “There is not much due in from my ward. Residents of Salt Lake are law-abiding people and tend to keep their tax payments clear,” said Chirimar. Residents of Duttabad, an added area under his ward, do not have to pay taxes.  
Tulsi Sinha Roy, the Ward 40 councillor, said that about Rs 2 crore worth of taxes was due from her ward.

“A chunk of these are receivable from commercial establishments like hotels and a shopping mall (City Centre),” said Roy whose ward includes CC, DC, CD and DD blocks.Kumar Shankar Sadhu, a member of the Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association said that residents of Salt Lake did not have much taxes pending. “We know for a fact that residents here have been making payments as most of them don't want to increase liabilities.Instead, the civic body should focus on areas that have been added during the formation of the corporation where no tax payments have been made over the past few years,” Sadhu said.An official said only 10 per cent of Salt Lake's taxpayers pay property tax online. This could be because there is a sizeable population of senior citizens here, many of whom are not comfortable making payments online. Unlike in New Town the corporation does not have any dedicated personnel to help file online taxes. In New Town the New Town Kolkata Development Authority has roped in services of “tax sathis” to help people pay their property tax.",2020-08-21 19:05:00
1195,Brinda Sarkar,Marching with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose - Telegraph India,"It might have been 1999 before a woman — Gunjan Saxena — got to fly for the Indian air force during a war but women had an entire army regiment to fight for India as early as the 1940s. And the credit goes to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.A webinar was organised last week on the women of the Indian National Army by the Indian Association for Asian and Pacific Studies.This is an academic think tank of college and university lecturers and researchers. “We had wanted to host this seminar for a while now and decided to time it around August 15 so as to arouse maximum interest in the audience,” said secretary Sarvani Gooptu.Speaking on the subject was Maitreyi Sengupta, former head of the history department of Shri Shikshayatan College and a resident of FE College.“Netaji was the greatest champion of women’s rights,” said Sengupta. “Our country is still battling dowry deaths and honour killings in the 21st century but Netaji had scripted this glorious chapter in Indian history with this regiment exclusively for women that was led by a woman too. It’s a pity that the Rani of Jhansi Regiment almost forgotten today.”Here is what Sengupta shared with the audience —  All for a causeNetaji’s vision for women was more radical and progressive than his contemporaries. Women had joined India’s freedom struggle as early as the 1920s but passively, selling khadi and the like. But Netaji wanted women to devote their lives to the ideal of freedom, just like men.At the Calcutta session of the Congress in 1928, Netaji had wanted the young women members to parade in military uniform but the party did not allow it. So the women marched in saris, but draped in a smart way that looked no less than a uniform.After leaving India, it was on July 9, 1943 in Singapore that Netaji announced the formation of the Indian National Army. At the same time he announced that the Rani of Jhansi Regiment would be an important part of it.But no one took him seriously or even thought this possible. The Indian-origin women of south east Asia were barely educated and had no exposure outside their houses and after a week of campaigning Netaji had recruited only 15 women. But one of them was Lakshmi Swaminathan, an energetic and active doctor.Alongside Swaminathan, Netaji held rallies across Singapore, Malaysia and Burma and the response was unbelievable. Young women in the audience rushed to the stage to enlist themselves. They took off their jewellery and donated on the spot, held up their children and said they would leave their families behind and join Netaji if he sought them.Most of these girls had never even laid foot on Indian soil but Netaji’s towering personality made them yearn for their roots. In a year or two, the Rani of Jhansi Regiment had 1,500 recruits. The strength of the entire Azad Hind Fauj was about 40,000 but 1,500 women in it was a significant number.Some women had to coax their families into joining the army but for many it wasn’t difficult. Entire families had joined Netaji by making donations to the cause and sending their children to become soldiers.Tough trainingThe training camps were held in Singapore, Malaysia and Burma and the women roughed it out like the men. They were taught to use fire arms, map reading, jungle warfare, guerrilla tactics, advanced nursing etc. It was also unprecedented that the women’s regiment was led by a woman — Swaminathan.The women went to Rangoon to fight but the British had already gained on the Japanese troupes there. They had to beat a retreat. Still, the regiment is of historical importance.Forgotten heroesAfter independence these women got a raw deal. The land they were ready to die for refused to acknowledge them as freedom fighters.They weren’t given citizenship or freedom fighter pension.Swaminathan married a fellow INA soldier Prem Sehgal and was better known as Captain Lakshmi Sahgal for the rest of her life. She had joined politics and continued to serve as a doctor in Kanpur, where she had settled.Another soldier Janaky Devar returned to Malaysia and joined politics there too. There were sisters Aruna Ganguly and Shanti Ganguly too who hailed from south east Asia but had homes in Calcutta and settled here.Several of these soldiers would come to Netaji Bhavan for his birth anniversary celebrations and I would get to speak to them. It was an honour.India today is moving backwards in every field but things would have been different had Netaji been around. He was a man who promoted true secularism and women’s emancipation.",2020-08-21 19:16:00
1196,Sudeshna Banerjee,Kedarnath temple at Sreebhumi this year - Telegraph India,"Sreebhumi will construct Kedarnath temple this year. And hope that it does not draw as big a crowd as the puja is known for.
“This is not a time to show off. We are not looking for perfection this year. We have told the decorator that. So there should not be 100-150 labourers at work at the pandal at any point,” said Dibyendu Kishor Goswami, chief co-ordinator of the puja committee.The club hosted khuti puja on Sunday with about 300-400 people in attendance. “In other years, we have more than 700. It was difficult to reduce further as our members total over 200.”To keep onlookers away, no celebrity was invited this time. “Last time, we had actress Subhashree and filmmaker Raj Chakraborty. Actor Dev and singers Raghav and Rupankar have  also attended our khuti puja in recent years,” he said. The puja’s sponsors were also not invited. Lunch and dinner, customary at Sreebhumi on the day, were cancelled in favour of packets of sweets. “We also handed over a sapling each to all visitors.” Priest Somesh Sashtri came all the way from Behala to perform the puja. To ensure that attendance was staggered through the day, instead of asking people to come during the start of the puja, the entire duration of the ritual was mentioned — from 10am to 3pm — so people could drop by at their convenience.Explaining the choice of the theme, Goswami said the puja venue has a ready structure which cannot be downsized. “Moreover, our idol started being built right after Jagaddhatri puja. That was long before coronavirus struck India.”Idol-maker Pradip Rudra Paul said the traditional idol would be 20ft high with chalchitra as in other years. “Work was stopped for three months because of lockdown. Even now, we are short of hands. Labourers are hardly being able to come,” said Rudra Paul, who makes around 65 idols every year. “Idols of most pujas will be smaller this time. But Sreebhumi and BJ Block in Salt Lake will retain last year’s idol height,” said the resident of BJ Block. Yubak Sangha Club, that usually celebrates Ganesh puja near PNB Island, inaugurated this year’s celebrations on Tuesday — online.
The Zoom meeting was attended by the likes of MLA and minister Sujit Bose, mayor Krishna Chakraborty and deputy mayor Tapas Chatterjee. “Due to the pandemic we have decided on the theme of ‘Grihakone Vinayak’ for our puja this year,” said Anindya Chatterjee club president and local councillor.The location of the idol has been kept a secret but those wishing to watch the rituals may, on August 22, watch the Facebook page ‘Bidhannagar Ganesh Chaturthi Mahotsav’. Payment can also be made online for the priest to perform puja on behalf of someone.",2020-08-21 19:21:00
1197,Brinda Sarkar,"New Town, Salt Lake:  Locked down townships sing ode to freedom - Telegraph India","CD Block, New TownNew Town’s CD Block celebrated August 15 with a YouTube video on some of the elderly residents of the block but it was much more than music and recitation. It was about memories.A couple, Ratneshwar and Reba Guha, recalled their childhood in what is now Bangladesh and about how they moved to India and began their lives afresh.Dipika Ghatak, a college student of the block, narrated the story of her grandpa Jitendra Lal Sen and his brother Manindra Chandra Sen, both freedom fighters. “Jitendra Lal was part of the Chittagong armoury raid led by Masterda Surya Sen. He was later awarded by Indira Gandhi,” said the proud grandchild. “Manindra Chandra was part of a group that tried to kill a British official in Myanmansingha. He was arrested and sent to the cellular jail in Andaman for six years.”They even got a byte from Manindra Chandra’s widow Pulina Rani Sen where she said she is flown to Andaman by the government for Independence Day every year. “I would have gone this year too, if it wasn’t for the lockdown,” she says.Shila Bose of the block sang a Dwijendrageeti, Amra emni ese bhese jaiand Bijan Das, the block president, recited Sukumar Ray’s Jibon er hishab. Gouri Sanyal sang, Amalabha Dutta spoke on spirituality and Shiuli Sarkar, who is stuck in Mumbai for the lockdown, sang a thumri.“We are planning two more instalments of this video in the weeks to come,” said Sithi Kana Ghatak, who conceptualised the presentation, called Smriti Manjari. Somsuddha Palit was the anchor and the video was executed by a group of youths called Pancha Pandav comprising Saptarshi Choudhury, Mrinalini Banerjee, Shruti Chinha, Beas Bera and Dipika.BK BlockThe BK Block flag was hoisted by mayor Krishna Chakraborty and a garbage collector Arjun Yadav, who was commemorated for his uninterrupted services during the pandemic. Yadav was quite nervous and disbelieving of the honour.  
In the evening, residents who are part of the block’s music-based WhatsApp group Cholo Gaan Gai presented a show over Google Meet.The largest participation was by kids - Shirshannita Majumdar, 10, recited Priyo Swadhinata, Debarpan Mukherjee, eight, sang Nanha munha rahi and the youngest participant — five year-old Ishani Bhattacharya — spoke on the Rani of Jhasi and sang a few lines of Main rahu ya na rahu from the film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi.Those like Somogga Choudhury danced solo but there were some group dances too, if one can call them so. Tanishka Das began dancing to Des mera rangila in her living room but the visual soon cut to Titasha Roy on her terrace. “I didn’t even know my song was getting punched with another didi’s,” said Tanishka, a Class VI student, puzzled. “But the overall effect looked great.”Most performances were pre-recorded and presented by Tamashree Saha, who along with the anchor Arpita Mukherjee, also sang Sare jaha se achcha.Oishik Das strummed the national anthem on guitar, Sammridha Mukherjee played the violin to Kadam kaam badhaye ja and there was an adorable presentation by brothers Baishyayan Banerjee, of Class X, and brother Debayan, of Class II.“Debayan had felt left out when his brother took part in this group’s Rabindrajayanti function online and insisted he join now,” said mother Baisakhi. The elder brother played the keyboard and the younger one sang Bharat amar Bharat barsha. Moreover Baishyayan wore an orange kurta and Debayan (whose head has been shaved recently for a Gandhi look-alike event at school) wore a green one.Chandra Sekhar Bag (better known as Babloo in the block) sang Banglar mati banglar jol with Sathi Ghosh. “I had sung a few lines and sent her to check if the scale was agreeable. And then we performed live. Most other events were pre-recorded to avoid network disruptions,” said Bag.The senior-most participant was Sathi Dasgupta who sang O amar desher mati with a tricolour sash on. Block president Rajarshi Chandra wished everyone and requested them to continue staying indoors. “I know it’s difficult but you can keep busy with such cultural endeavours,” he said.The group presented a video collage of residents waving the flag at home and concluded by standing up to sing the national anthem together.",2020-08-21 19:54:00
1198,Showli Chakraborty,Central Park: Cancelled fairs a fell blow for weavers - Telegraph India,"The Bidhananagar Municipal Corporation has declared that no fairs will be held at Central Park in 2020-21, demoralising not just visitors but also boutique owners and artisans who depend heavily on these fairs for their income.“We shall not hold any fairs at Central Park in Karunamoyee in 2020-21. Some of the most popular fairs in the city like Saras Mela, Handicraft Fair, Taanter Haat and Bidhannagar Mela are annually held here but the state government has asked us not to accept any bookings for now. In case we already have bookings from early birds, we have been asked to refund the money,"" said Devashis Jana, mayoral council member, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.This comes as a big setback to small-time businessmen involved in the handicraft and cottage industry who participated in these fairs for years. In fact, for many of them this was their sole source of livelihood.Anjan Biswas, a 30-year-old weaver, has been setting up a stall called Fulia Sari Centre at Bidhannagar Mela for the last 10 years. “We have a huge customer base in boutiques of Salt Lake and Ballygunge and have been coming to Taanter Haat and Bidhannagar Mela for a decade now. But the lockdown has killed our business. Ever since the lockdown was declared in March we have not had any new orders,” said Biswas, who had to let go of his team of 30 weavers in April. “We are receiving dry ration from the local administration but have no cash in hand,” he said.Boutiques of Salt Lake and New Town are also facing the blues. Most of them have workshops in their garages where tailors work on customised orders or block print tables. Abira Roychowdhury, who runs a boutique called Ranikahini near Laboni Estate, said that her business has largely shifted online.“The shutters are down but I’m selling saris, blouses, jewellery online through Facebook and WhatsApp groups. I’m not buying any new stock, just clearing what I had in hand. If things don’t improve before the Pujas, why would people shop for new clothes?” she said.Agreed Arpita Roy, who runs the boutique Arpita’s in BA Block: “We have had very few customers since the lockdown was lifted in June. Even now with a semi-lockdown situation still in place, things are not likely to improve. The roads are empty and so are the shops. We do make some online sales but it is minimal,” said Roy.Besides Salt Lake, New Town mela ground, Eco Park fairgrounds and Biswa Bangla Convention Centres had emerged popular for exhibitions. Traditional art and craft forms - from patachitra to sitalpati mats and dokra jewellery - gained visibility at fairs and exhibitions held here. Most of the artistes who live in poverty and hail from marginalised communities, had started looking at fairs as a source of income and exposure to wider market opportunities. Once they started setting up stalls in the government fairs, many claim their average income increased by nearly 50 per cent over the last five years.“We have been receiving requests for booking quite regularly but have been delaying or postponing them since we don’t know when we can host the fairs again,” Sen said, urging weavers to set up online stores for their businesses. “Online is the only way forward now.Everything has shifted online right from films to birthday parties and business meetings,” he said.",2020-08-21 20:07:00
1199,Snehal Sengupta,BD Market: Old project barb at civic body launches  - Telegraph India,"A slew of facilities and services was inaugurated by fire and emergency services minister Sujit Bose, the MLA of Bidhannagar, mayor Krishna Chakraborty and other officials of the civic body on August 14. But the opposition claims these are old and revamped projects.
Among the newly-renovated facilities is BD Market that the civic officials claimed had undergone a thorough makeover.According to mayor Chakraborty, the market’s toilet has been rebuilt, the floor relaid and a new shed for fish and vegetable sellers has been constructed.But renovation of the market in reality is far from over. According to official sources, what was inaugurated was work done in just the second phase of work. “Since shifting the shops is a problem, work has been going on for years. This phase started in 2018. The first phase had been approved by the previous civic board. The third phase of repair and renovation is currently under way,” said a civic official.A visit to the market on Sunday, the day after the inauguration, indeed revealed what can at best be described as work in progress.A board in front of a series of temporary stalls under a tin shed read that the shed has been set up as the market was being revamped.Plastic sheets made for the roof of several open areas and such sheets were seen on top of the market as well.“The roof leaks. The repairs for this place is taking forever,” said Bikas Saha, who owns a shop in BD Market.What had been achieved was at the back of the market — two toilets, one for the shopkeepers and another pay-and-use one for visitors.About a dozen stationery goods and grocery shops had also been repaired.Questioned about the current state and the need to “inaugurate” a market where work is yet to be completed, Chakraborty said that work would complete soon and majority of the renovation work had been completed.In addition to this, waste segregation at source for 10 wards of Salt Lake was also inaugurated.According to Chakraborty, separate bins for biodegradable and non-biodegradable household waste items have been despatched to houses in these wards.“We are encouraging people to segregate their household waste before handing them over to the door-to-door waste collectors. The response has been quite good,” said Chakraborty.Saheli Gupta, a homemaker in ED Block, said that although she had been segregating the waste at home and using the two bins, most collectors were dumping the separate packets into the same van.“Most of the collectors who come don’t have separate bins and are dumping the waste into a single one in their vans,” said .
Chakraborty said that once the bin distribution was complete they would focus on handing out larger bins to waste collectors.“We have distributed around 1,000 large bins to our door-to-door conservancy teams. We will distribute more in the coming months,” Chakraborty said.Another service that was “inaugurated” is the online issue of birth and death certificates. This facility too existed but the mayor pointed out that they had streamlined the process and made it more user-friendly.A former councillor of the civic body said that it was disheartening to see that the corporation was digging up old existing projects, branding them as new and inaugurating them.Former mayor Sabyasachi Dutta who is now a BJP secretary, said that it exposed the fact that the corporation had not carried out any new developmental projects.“All these are old wine in new bottles. It is sad that old projects are being passed off as new and inaugurated. The residents will see through this,” said Dutta.",2020-08-21 20:25:00
1200,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus outbreak: Jodhpur Park puja to take idol out on streets across city - Telegraph India,"If visitors are unable to step out of their homes during Durga puja, the puja will reach their doorstep. Jodhpur Park Saradiya Utsab Committee is rolling out Durga Gari which will take the Goddess on tour across the city.This is the second Covid-19 induced innovation coming to light after the drive-in darshan announced by another south Calcutta puja hub of Badamtala Ashar Sangha-66 Palli-Nepal Bhattacharjee Street Club triad, reported earlier in Metro.“Every year, people visit us from neighbourhoods near and far. But with the pandemic raging, many will be scared to go pandal-hopping. This is one way we thought they can have a feel of the Pujas without any risk,” said general secretary of the Jodhpur Park puja Sumanta Roy.The concept was mooted by theme-maker Bapai Sen. “The inspiration is the chariot of Lord Jagannath. I thought if He can roam the streets and grant darshan to devotees on Rathyatra, why not Devi Durga?” said Sen. He is carving an idol out pf wood to protect against the elements. “The first vehicle with the goddess will be decorated with patachitra carrying visual messages to defeat the coronavirus demon,” he added. The second will carry the dhaki, residents’ body members and the theme-maker.There will be theme music and lights too.The tableaux will be out on the streets from Panchami to Dashami. “The bodhon can happen in say, Shyambazar, the Saptami arati  in Garia and the Ashtami anjali in Howrah,” Roy said. “If we get requests from any locality, we will try to reach there. Our  slogan this year is Jodhpur Park paray paray (in every locality).”If travelling Durga is a part of the 68th edition of the puja, virtual Durga is another. Visitors brave enough to reach the puja site will watch the puja on screen. The rituals happening behind closed doors will be beamed live on half a dozen  giant LED screens set up close to the pandal.“The kind of footfall we get will make it impossible for us to maintain social distancing in the visitor queue. We do not want any infection-related accidents,” said Roy.An app will  stream the puja live, as will the puja committee’s website www.jodhpurparkdurgapujo.com.Sen said he is not charging any remuneration this year. “I have been earning from this festival for 22 years now. This is my turn to give back.”",2020-08-22 03:19:00
1201,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: NIT Durgapur students can pay fees in instalments - Telegraph India,"The National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, will let students pay tuition fees in instalments in the coming semester.Hostel and some other fees have been brought down considering the hardship students are facing during the pandemic, an institute official said.The normal practice is paying the fees in full at the start of a semester. An exception has been made for the autumn semester, scheduled to start from September, the official said.A meeting of the NIT’s Deans council decided that 60 per cent of the tuition fees of Rs 62,500 has to be paid by September 30. The remaining by December 15. Hostel and other fees can be paid by December 15.The hostel fees of Rs 7,300 has been brought down to Rs 2,800 and that of the other fees of Rs 5,300 to Rs 2,850.“The revised fees structure for the upcoming semester will be announced after the NIT’s board of governors approves it,” Anupam Basu, the institute director, said.The revised structure is likely to be uploaded on the institute’s website next week. “The pandemic has caused economic stress to families across the country… we are trying to give them as much relief as possible. Although the decisions will impact our internal revenue generation, we will allow payments in instalments,” director Basu said.Basu, on lien from IIT Kharagpur, has been helming the institute since 2018. “We have reduced the hostel and other fees as well.”A few students wrote to teachers, seeking relaxation in fees citing family hardship. The hostel fees in each semester comprises, seat rent, electricity and water charges, hostel employees’ welfare fund, students’ aid fund, maintenance and development charge, an institute official said.The other institute fees include library charge, computing charge, students’ health care, examination fee, students’ activity fund, and comprehensive insurance premium, including medical insurance. The fees under all heads have been reduced, he said.The institute plans to start online classes in September and will offer its 350-odd students with connectivity issues the option of attending crash semester on the campus to make up for theory classes they might miss out.“We will help those grappling with connectivity problems… similarly we are trying to help all amid the crisis with a revised fee structure,” another official said. Several institutes have revised their fee structures during the pandemic. Students of the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, will not have to pay the mess advance and water and electricity charges this semester.IIT Kharagpur has waived mess fees and hostel overhead charges, along with some other charges.In every instance, students have cited online classes as the reason behind their demand to reduce fees, another official of the Durgapur institute said.",2020-08-22 03:22:00

1203,Debraj Mitra,Alipore zoo death focus on cable below ground - Telegraph India,"The two workers electrocuted at Alipore zoo on Thursday might have come in contact with an underground cable, CESC sources said. A team from the power utility visited the site, near the elephant enclosure, on Friday. “A portion of the ground was dug up. Prima facie, it seems the workers had come in contact with an underground wire that was damaged while digging the ground,” a CESC official said.“The hole was filled with water because of rain and the team could not access the wire. The team is likely to visit again on Saturday.” Two contractual labourers were electrocuted and a third was injured after 1pm on Thursday, a zoo official said. Metro erroneously reported that the accident had occurred around 11.30am. The injured person, Liton Das, was brought out of ventilation on Friday. Tarani Ghosh and Pradip Das had been declared dead on arrival at a private hospital.A contractual labourer who was part of the group said on Friday that Ghosh had come in  contact with the wire first. Pradip Das had tried to save him and Liton Das had tried to save Pradip Das. The Bengal Zoo Authority has ordered a probe. A team comprising electrical engineers was to have visited the spot. “They could not come today because of the lockdown. They will come tomorrow,” said Asis Kumar Samanta, the zoo director. Police have registered a case of unnatural death. “The post-morten report is awaited. There is no complaint of negligence till now,” said an officer. Calcutta High Court advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said the absence of a complaint did not prevent the police from registering a case suo motu. “Two people have lost their lives. The police cannot wait for the zoo to conduct a probe. They should have registered a case of death due to negligence and started a probe to ascertain what happened,” he said.",2020-08-22 03:25:00
1204,Our Special Correspondent,Writing on the wall nets ‘killer’ - Telegraph India,"A threat message to a CID officer written on the wall of a pulse mill where a labourer was found murdered on Wednesday gave away the killer, police said.Cops matched the writing of the message, “CID officer Raj Sadhan…. Agar zyada chalaki karoge toe khud fas jaoge”, with that of the jottings in a notebook, the police said. Suman Sheikh, 29, who is a labourer at the mill in Ultadanga has been arrested in connection with the murder. Sheikh, who hails from Birbhum, could not flee the city because of the lockdown on two consecutive days and he spent two nights inside Deshapriya Park, the police said.
He was picked up from the park on Friday morning. “He wanted to warn cops to stay away from him. He had made up the CID officer’s name,” an investigator said. “There were two writings on the wall. One was about the ‘CID officer’ and the other about another labourer, Kanbali. Initially, we had detained Kanbali and questioned him. But we realised the culprit was trying to divert us.”Rakesh Shaw, 30, was found dead with multiple injuries inside the mill on Wednesday. Kanbali had told cops that Sheikh used to jot his songs down in a notebook. “We got the handwriting sample from the notebook... prima facie it matches with the writing on the wall. He has confessed to the crime,” an officer said.Shaw and Sheikh had an old quarrel and on Tuesday night, Sheikh had tried to take some money out of Shaw’s pocket, the police said. He woke up and resisted and got killed with a knife.",2020-08-22 03:26:00
1205,"Subhajoy Roy, Debraj Mitra",Showers and tide  threaten waterlogging in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Parts of Kalighat and Bodyguard Lines in Alipore were flooded on Friday and several other pockets of Calcutta could witness such inundation as the weather office forecast more rain from Sunday, officials and engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) have warned. The continuous rain for several days has already raised the level of the Hooghly. The height that the Hooghly’s water reaches during high tide in August and September is more than that in the rest of the year. “There could be waterlogging if it rains heavily and during the high tide hours,” a CMC engineer said on Friday afternoon.“During high tide, the sluice gates that drain out water from the city’s drainage network are kept closed to prevent entry of Hooghly water into the network. Usually, the sluice gates are kept closed for at least an hour before and after the peak of the high tide,” said a CMC engineer. “But in August and September, the gates are kept closed for a longer duration as the level of water is higher during high tide.” The sluice gates are operated to drain out water from the underground drainage network into the Hooghly in the west and Bidyadhari river in the east. The city received over 115mm of rain between August 17 morning and August 21 morning under the influence of a low-pressure area that had formed over the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday.“The system has lost strength and travelled towards central India. But a new low-pressure area is likely to form over the north Bay of Bengal on Sunday. Under its influence, widespread rain is expected in south Bengal. One or two places, including Calcutta, might get heavy rain from Sunday,” said a Met official.“The monsoon trough still passes through south Bengal. The monsoon currents are strong and are expected to trigger rain on Saturday as well,” said G.K. Das, the director of IMD Calcutta. The city sky remained overcast throughout Friday and there were multiple spells of rain. The incessant rain that the city had witnessed over the past few days was missing.A resident of Kalighat said water in the Adi Ganga had breached banks and flooded roads nearby during high tide on Thursday. “It happens every year quite a few times in August and September. And if high tide is accompanied by heavy rain, waterlogging endures for some time,” said the resident. Tarak Singh, a member of Calcutta Municipal Corporation board of administrators in charge of drainage, said the civic body had kept ready 650 portable pumps to drain out water from low-lying areas. “All 74 drainage pumping stations have been kept ready, too, so they can work in full capacity,” he said. The civic body also employs teams of people who clean the mouth of gully pits on flooded roads so the accumulated water could flow into the underground drainage network. The men also open man-hole covers to quickly drain out water. “There is some shortage of personnel because of the pandemic but we have kept teams ready in the boroughs,” said one CMC engineer. Vast portions of the Sunderbans riverine belt were inundated because heavy rain, accompanied by tidal waters, breached earthen embankments in North and South 24-Parganas. The water levels in the Roymangal, Bidyadhari, Kalindi and Goureshwar rivers have risen, said district officials. Additional reporting by Subhasish Chaudhuri",2020-08-22 03:30:00
1206,Mita Mukherjee,Daily college admission data - Telegraph India,"Every state-aided college in Bengal will have to upload the details of students’ admissions to undergraduate courses on the state higher education department’s portal on a daily basis from the day admissions start till the process is completed.As part of the move, aimed at ensuring transparency in the admission process, the colleges will have to state the number of students admitted every day in each subject. They will also have to enter the number of male, female, SC, ST, OBC and physically handicapped students admitted.Undergraduate admissions will start on September 1 and continue till September 25.“The colleges have been asked to upload the details of each day’s admission from 5pm that day till 5pm the next day on the portal Banglar Uchchashiksha,” an official in the higher education department said.“Once a college submits a day’s details, the module for that day will be locked and the data cannot be changed. Once all details are uploaded, the admission data will be matched with the merit lists,’ the official said.Each college will have to post the merit list on its website on August 28.The higher education department sent the guidelines to every college this week on how they will have to submit the admission details on the portal.This is the first time the department will monitor college admissions centrally. “The main intention of the government’s move is to ensure transparency in admission and prevent colleges from admitting students in excess of their capacity,” the higher education department official said.Before starting admissions, every college has to upload on the Banglar Uchchashiksha portal it’s intake capacity in each subject, infrastructure available for each course and teacher strength and also mention whether the courses are self-financed or run with assistance from the government. Such data have to be uploaded from August 18 to September 1.   Till last year, the colleges were required to send admission details to their respective affiliating universities, which would forward the data to the higher education department. But most colleges would allegedly not follow the instruction. Many would send admission details of a particular day seven to 10 days later, an official said.Some colleges would allegedly keep seats in certain subjects that were in demand vacant in the initial stage of admissions. These seats would later be offered to students with low marks on recommendation of local political leaders or student unions.The colleges have been accepting application forms for admission from August 10.",2020-08-22 03:32:00
1207,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Advice to free up ICU for critical patients   - Telegraph India,"A panel of government doctors is visiting hospitals and requesting authorities and doctors to shift Covid patients out of intensive care units when they show signs of improvement.The move will help hospitals in admitting more critical patients to ICUs, the panel has said.Hospitals in several countries have faced shortage of ICU beds during the pandemic. In countries like the US and Italy, many hospitals have said they could not provide critical patients with proper care for want of ICU beds.“In India and Bengal, the situation is still not that bad. But with thousands of fresh cases being reported in our state daily, keeping ICU beds available, as many as possible, is one of our top priority,” a health department official said. “We cannot force doctors to shift critical patients out of ICUs but we are advising them how they can be less rigid in evaluating the criticality of a Covid patient.”Had Covid not struck, such patients would have been in ICUs till they became completely stable, the official, who is a public health expert as well, said. “But Covid treatment should be a mix of scientific decision-making, pragmatism and humane approach.”If a patient’s oxygen requirement drops to less than two litres a minute for the past few days and his/her oxygen-saturation level in the blood doesn’t fluctuate, that person maybe shifted out of the ICU, Gopal Krishna Dhali, the head of gastroenterology at SSKM Hospital, said. “He needs intensive bedside monitoring either in a cabin or a ward.”Dhali is leading the panel of government doctors to check if treatment protocols are being followed in Covid hospitals. “It is important to create facilities for more serious patients who require immediate intervention.”The panel has been suggesting to doctors that elderly people who don’t show any major fluctuations in their oxygen saturation level in the blood can be shifted out of ICUs if their blood pressure stabilises.“Patients with no reports of any organ distress and who don’t require high-flow nasal cannula for their oxygen support and can do with an oxygen mask maybe considered for shifting out of ICUs,” a health department official said. “Once out of ICUs, nurses have to continuously monitor them.”An increasing number of asymptomatic or mildly-infected Covid patients are suddenly developing breathlessness because of a fall in the saturation level of oxygen in blood. Such patients can recover fast if they are shifted to ICUs, the official said.“The idea is to start non-invasive ventilation at the earliest for critically ill Covid patients. This can prevent rapid deterioration where the patient might need invasive ventilation,” the official said. “So, ensuring a bed in an ICU remains vital. Doctors can’t shrug their responsibility and keep a patient in ICU to play safe.”Several senior doctors said ICU management had emerged as the most vital element in treating serious Covid patients with pneumonia. If these patients are shifted to ICUs in the early stage, they can recover fast, the doctors said.“We have seen close to 50 per cent of Covid patients in ICUs recovering fast and moving out,” Sumit Sengupta, a senior pulmonologist in Calcutta, said. “Usually, ICUs have trained nurses to constantly monitor patients and alert doctors about their condition. That makes all the difference. So, if a patient has to be shifted out, the monitoring has to be ensured.”One problem of shifting such patients to general wards was the lack of infrastructure, the CEO of a private hospital said. “The wards and private cabins don’t have high-flow oxygen supply system that is there in an ICU. High-flow oxygen supply means more than 20 litres of oxygen can be supplied in a minute. Also, many crucial monitoring gadgets are not there that record a patient’s vital parameters. But if experts advise, we have to see how this can be managed.”",2020-08-22 03:36:00
1208,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus outbreak: Antigen test focus on mobile groups - Telegraph India,"Rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 are being conducted in New Town with a focus on household workers in senior citizen’s homes, construction labourers, shopkeepers and e-rickshaw drivers. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) and the state health department have opened a testing centre between the Condor building and the Rosedale Garden complex in Action Area III. The tests, which started on Thursday, are being conducted free and results are available within 30 minutes. One can turn up at the centre between 10am and 2.30pm any day to get tested.“We are focussing on household help, shopkeepers and e-rickshaw (toto) drivers because they come in contact with a large number of people daily. If they are infected by the coronavirus,  the risk of it spread among a larger group is high. Construction workers are also being given priority because many of them, engaged at various sites in New Town, have tested positive,” an NKDA official said. The NKDA will reach out to these groups and try to convince them to get tested.“We want to get domestic help, especially those hired by senior citizens, because they move from one house to another,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. The agency will approach residents’ associations and block associations to prepare a list of domestic help.A cell will be set up to trace contacts of those testing positive and arrangements will be made to get the contacts tested as well, the official said. If any of those testing negative has mild or moderate symptoms of Covid-19, he or she will be subjected to the confirmatory RT-PCR test after a check by doctors at the centre.“The move will bring tests closer to doorsteps so more people can be brought under surveillance. We want to increase the number of tests in all hotspots,” an official said.Residents who want to get themselves tested can do so by calling the 24X7 New Town helpline — 1800-103-7652. After getting an appointment, one can download a form from the Hidco or the NKDA website. The forms can also be downloaded from https://www.wbhidcoltd.com/uploads/announcement/Ann841.pdf. “To save time, one can take a printout of the filled-in form and report at the testing centre,” an official said.Twenty-eight tests were performed on Thursday and Friday.

1209,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Kolkata dumps kitchen waste in Covid bins - Telegraph India,"The yellow bins put up across Calcutta to collect Covid waste have been filled with food, vegetables and construction waste.Cleaners of the private agency that has received the contract to clean the yellow bins were stumped when they went to clear them in some places on Friday. The bins were filled with fruit peels, vegetables, cooked and discarded food.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has installed 2,000 such bins across the city.The bins have clearly written on them what can be dumped but people haven't followed it, an official of the private agency said. The dumping of kitchen waste in the bins shows the lack of waste segregation culture in Calcutta where all kinds of waste are packed together and dumped in wheeled carts every morning. “People should dump only biomedical waste in these yellow bins. They should throw their used masks, face shields, hand gloves and PPEs in these bins. The bins are not meant for kitchen waste,” Ramakant Burman, the managing director of GreenTech Environ, the private agency, said. The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, applicable across the country had mandated that household waste be segregated at source. The waste must be divided into biodegradable, non-biodegradable and domestic hazardous waste. But the segregation did not take off in Calcutta barring in seven wards in the Calcutta municipal area. The CMC is now extending the segregation at source infrastructure in 20 more wards. Still that covers only 27 of the 144 wards of the CMC. Sourabh Manuja, a fellow at the Centre for Waste Management at The Energy and Resources Institute, said the municipal corporation should conduct an extensive awareness campaign to let people know the purpose of the yellow bins. “Effective waste management is dependent on awareness among people.”Greentech Environ is collecting biomedical waste from close to 4,000 homes where Covid patients with mild symptoms are in home isolation. The company is charging Rs 500 for each yellow bin. It will get an additional payment if the weight of the waste in a bin exceeds 1kg, an official of the company said.",2020-08-22 03:40:00
1210,Subhajoy Roy And Debraj Mitra,Covid: government agency advertisement mirrors plight of restaurants - Telegraph India,"Eat out to help those who are feeling the economic heat of the pandemic, a government agency that runs three restaurants in the city has appealed to people.The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), custodian of properties like Eco Park and the Biswa Bangla Gate in New Town, has come out with an advertisement that mirrors the plight of most restaurants as they struggle to cope with low footfall.“The chef, the server, the manager and a lot of people whom you see or who work in the background are facing the heat of the pandemic. Eat out to help them,” says the appeal. The three Hidco restaurants employ about 200 people.Debashis Sen, chairman and managing director of Hidco, told The Telegraph on Friday that the appeal was prompted by someone he knew losing his job.“The man I know had moved on from our restaurant for a better career. But a few days ago, he wanted to meet me again. He had lost his job during the pandemic. The sector is bleeding and since we run three restaurants, I felt like making this appeal,” he said.Hidco officials ruled out immediate job cuts and said the workers’ salaries would not be affected although revenues had not kept pace with expectations so far.Many thousands who worked at other restaurants and bars across the city lacked a similar cushion. Many have lost their jobs or are on furlough, and the luckier ones have had their salaries cut.On June 8, during the second phase of Unlock, restaurants had resumed business with a “lot of hope”.However, with a spike in Covid-19 cases since late July, the number of people stepping out to eat, especially after dark, has dropped again although Unlock III did away with the night curfew.“The fear is there. People are thinking twice before dining out,” said Debraj Bose, who runs Pa Pa Ya on Park Street.A doctor at the Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital said: “There is no problem eating out if one follows the safety protocols and maintains social distancing.But safety has to be ensured at both ends, by the customers as well as the restaurants. It is a continuous process that has to be followed while travelling to the restaurant, eating there and returning home.”Nitin Kothari, who owns Mocambo and Peter Cat, said people’s fears had deepened after Amitabh Bachchan fell ill. “Now that he is home and safe, things are looking better,” Kothari said.Many places, including star hotels, have started food delivery and are texting promotional and curated menus to patrons. Some are offering discounts on weekdays.Weekends are drawing diners to Dhaba Ajante, the open-air restaurant at Eco Park. “People are preferring to eat in a non-enclosed space. But in our indoor restaurants we have movable partitions that are installed between two adjacent tables the moment they both get occupied. So, people can safely come and eat,” the official said.",2020-08-22 03:41:00
1211,Monalisa Chaudhuri,CESC issues monsoon safety guideline - Telegraph India,"A CESC team on Friday went to Botanic Garden Lane, in Shibpur, to trim branches that had entangled in electricity wires or been touching lamp posts, a day after two men were electrocuted after accidentally touching a post in the lane.Residents rued that Suman Sharma and Srikanta Das, who were on their way home through a flooded Botanic Garden Lane when they met with the accident, could have been still alive had the branches been trimmed on Thursday.They alleged that a CESC team had inspected the spot on Thursday morning following a complaint of a loud sound from a lamp post and declared that the post was safe. The team from the power utility allegedly left the spot telling people that some branches needed to be trimmed.However, no one arrived to trim the branches. Seven hours later, the two men in their 30s were electrocuted after touching the same lamp post.On Thursday, CESC officials had told The Telegraph that the incident of electrocution was “not related to tree trimming” and that an investigation had been started to ascertain the cause of the incident.On Friday, none of the CESC officials commented on the investigation.The utility during the day came out with a “monsoon safety guideline”, whose first point urged people to avoid coming in close proximity with electrical poles, stray wires, distribution boxes and kiosks during rain.People have also been warned against touching electrical switches with wet hands and using mobile phones when they are being charged.Residents of Botanic Garden Lane said the two men possibly could not have averted coming in contact with the lamp post as the entire lane was waterlogged.“A drain on the other side of the lane was overflowing. The entire lane was flooded. Only a small patch around the lamp post was dry as it was situated on a higher level. The men had stepped on the dry patch and came in contact with the lamp post,” said Sarada Pasi, who lives in a house in front of the spot where the fatal accident happened.On Friday, when two CESC men wearing gum boots and helmets appeared with a ladder, some residents complained how this act, if done 24 hours before, could have saved two lives.“They trimmed most of the branches that fell on the electrical wires. I wish this work were done yesterday,” one of them said.Power supply to the lamp posts in the lane was cut off on Thursday night.

By the early 1970s, road accidents were claiming thousands of lives every year and among the dead were many children. This led to a movement called Stop de Kindermoord, meaning stop child murder.In the Dutch capital of Amsterdam, activists adopted the bicycle in protest. Around this time, the Arab countries had imposed an embargo on export of oil to Holland and a few other European countries for supporting Israel. This led to a steep rise in oil prices. Even politicians began to see the advantage of a lifestyle not too dependent on oil. Holland, and especially Amsterdam, began to change.Amsterdam is currently known as the bicycle capital of the world. Calcutta today, despite all obvious differences, may be where Amsterdam was in the 1970s, feels Bicycle Mayor of Calcutta Satanjib Gupta. The title conferred on Gupta by BYCS, an Amsterdam-based global network that promotes the bicycle, may sound absurdly grand, but the lockdown has led to so many absurdities already.“Have you seen photographs of the Howrah Bridge during lockdown,” asks Gupta. “Full of bicycles, it was a wonderful sight.” The number of bicycles in the city’s streets, estimated to have been over three lakh before the lockdown, has gone up several times. Its sales have soared since June. “The cycle is not only helping maintain livelihoods but also opening up livelihood options,” says Gupta. It is helping the delivery of products and services.This, for Gupta, could be the moment of change for Calcutta.The bicycle is the perfect vehicle for social distancing, for exercise, especially for lung power — advocated during the Spanish Flu, too — and for immunity. It is fuel-free and hence an antidote to climate change; cheap and almost zero-maintenance. It ensures equality of all and had played its part in empowering women. And yet, how poorly it has fared in Calcutta, which also has the highest percentage (11 per cent) of bicycle commuters among all Indian metros. Over the last two decades, it has slowly been pushed off the streets by the authorities.  A circular issued by the police commissioner in 2008 had banned bicycles, categorised as “slow-moving vehicles”, from 38 city streets. In 2013, another police circular raised the number of streets to an impossible 174. In 2014, that was brought down to 62 by yet another circular. Cyclists would complain of harassment by the police, who would stop them and impose fines arbitrarily.So this year, after a nod from the chief minister, on June 9, the latest police circular raised hopes. It stated that with public transport restricted because of the pandemic, all bicycles would be allowed in the lanes and bylanes. But the harassment of cyclists continues, claim enthusiasts, and there is no clarity about routes. “Why can’t the main thoroughfares be opened for now to bicycles,” asks Gupta.A humiliating fine had led Raghu Jana to found the Kolkata Cycle Samaj with his friends in 2009; its primary aim is to get the ban lifted. Jana, a private tutor, who took part in political movements, speaks about the peculiar position the bicycle occupies, or does not occupy, in the law and regulations of the city.The classic way to undermine someone is to look through. It applies to bicycles too. “The bicycle is never addressed,” rues Jana. It is only banned. “Two years ago, we saw a police notice asking cyclists to follow the rules. We were glad. They were speaking to us,” he says.Encouraged, he and his Kolkata Cycle Samaj colleagues met a senior police official. But nothing changed.Jana points out that the police circulars were issued under the West Bengal Traffic Regulation Act, 1965, and the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, but there is no specific body of rules in the city relating to the bicycle. “We are only told what we can’t do,” he says.The roads have only “No Cycling” signs.Sabuj Sathi, the state government showpiece programme, is far more successful in distributing bicycles among school students in the districts.  This is ironic for a city in which the bicycle, which became popular in its contemporary form from the 1880s, had enjoyed pride of place. It is even said that in 1870, a Santragachhi resident manufactured a bicycle that would require two persons to ride it, says Gupta. Eminent Bengalis, including Dwijendranath Tagore, J.C. Bose and his wife Abala Bose, P.C. Ray and Nilratan Sircar, had all patronised the bicycle, Gupta adds.In Rabindranath Tagore’s short story Ponrokkha (1911), a young man yearns for a bicycle, which promises him freedom and joy, at only Rs 125. Personal Assistant, a 1959 Bengali film, has a beaming Bhanu Bandyopadhyay breezing through the still elegant and roomy central Calcutta roads on his bicycle, at par with motor cars.“Just the joy of riding a cycle,” says Jana. “Your body develops a unique relationship with it.” He questions the right of the police to decide the fate of cycles in the city. “This is a matter of urban planning,” he stresses. And of policy. Yet he is hopeful. “This is a moment of transition. Many may not want to give up on the joy of riding a bicycle when things normalise,” he says.The bicycle just needs a little encouragement in the city.“At the moment, it will be enough if the guard rails, lying everywhere now, are used to mark off a part of street at one end for cycles,” says Jana. Official bicycle lanes can be created later. “This is also the best moment for the ban to be lifted,” he adds.State transport secretary Prabhat Mishra is happy that so many cycles are in the streets. “But finding space in the city (for bicycles) is the biggest challenge,” he adds. In Calcutta, roads constitute only 7 per cent of the city area.The larger issue is an absolute lack of transport policy, says leading environment activist from the city, Naba Dutta. Since the formulation of the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (2001-2025) and discussions around another plan in 2011, there has been no planning for the city,” says Dutta. Roads, flyovers, overbridges have been built, but in a piecemeal, ad hoc way. “CNG buses are yet to roll out in the streets and bicycle lanes were part of the original plan of the E.M. Bypass.”The lack of planning has been made worse by the lack of environmental concern, says Dutta. Like bicycles, trams have been removed from the city streets. The car culture has overtaken everything and the bicycle has become the poor person’s vehicle. All this despite the fact that vehicular emissions are the biggest contributor to air pollution in Calcutta.At more than 350 cars per kilometre, Calcutta is one of the country’s most car-dense cities. Since the lockdown, with many cars off the street, the air feels much clearer. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment shows that peak levels of particulate matter or PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide have dropped by 46 and 74 per cent, respectively, during the lockdown compared with pre-lockdown days.“The stretch from Sealdah to Dalhousie can be made car-free. Before the lockdown, lakhs of people walked down the stretch every day to reach their workplaces and back. Same for the Chitpore to Esplanade stretch,” says Dutta. Calcutta could also use its waterways, he adds. “From our environmental platform Sabuj Mancha, we have been repeatedly asking the government for a comprehensive transport policy,” says Dutta, a cyclist himself.  Urban planner Tathagata Chatterjee, who is professor in the department of Urban Planning and Governance at Bhubaneswar’s Xavier University, also insists on an overall transportation policy, but with planned intervention. “Just setting up bicycle lanes is not enough. This happened in Bhubaneswar, where now they are mostly used as parking.”“Planning for cycle and pedestrian infrastructure needs to be addressed together,” says Chatterjee, stressing on a strategy that uses different modes of transport. He assesses the disadvantages of Calcutta to accommodate such transport: the population density, extreme low road space, mixed traffic, road condition, encroachments, car parking, garbage dumps, movement of pedestrians, chances of collision with motorised vehicles, particularly autos, scooters and motorbikes, weather conditions of rain and heat, and lack of supporting infrastructure. Where does one park the bicycle is an important question he raises.But Calcutta has its advantages. It is a city of small distances. An average trip length in Calcutta is about five to six kilometres. Chatterjee says that this and a system of feeder transport can help the bicycle here. “In Calcutta, cycles should be used for short neighbourhood streets, not main roads. Dedicated cycle lanes are more suitable for planned areas such as New Town and Salt Lake,” he adds. According to him, while treating trams as feeder transport, authorities need to focus on creating a non-motorised rail-based mass transit system linking suburban rail, Metro rail and trams. Attention should be paid to good pedestrian infrastructure too. Thought has to go into creating parking spaces for bicycles. Cycle-friendly cities such as Copenhagen, London, Singapore — have done all of this. “The Comprehensive Mobility Plan has to be revisited,” says Chatterjee.In the meantime, here, the public sector undertaking Hidco is encouraging bicycles in the New Town area and the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority has decided to take part in the national-level competition “Cycles 4 Change Challenge” organised by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.A 56-year-old Calcuttan, Sudipto Roy, chief public relations officer of a multinational company that also manufactures car batteries, has turned cycle fan. He has taken to cycling to work every day during lockdown. He says, “In two months my blood pressure and blood sugar levels have come down.”He too has a question — “Why does this city reward the motorists and punish the cyclists?”",2020-08-23 00:23:00
1213,Subhajoy Roy,"On request, CMC set for rapid antigen tests in housing complexes - Telegraph India","The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will conduct rapid antigen tests in housing complexes if residents request for the tests, Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators, said on Saturday.Residents, though, have to ensure at least 20 people would undergo the tests.  They must provide an AC room to conduct the tests, Hakim said.A request for the tests can be WhatsApped to 9830037493. There will be no charges for the tests.Civic officials will get in touch with the sender of the message and fix a date and time for the tests. “We have decided to conduct rapid antigen tests at housing complexes if at least 20 people agree to undergo the tests. Residents have to provide an AC room to conduct the tests… it is very difficult for a medical technologist to conduct the tests wearing a PPE in this weather,” Hakim said at the civic headquarters on Saturday.“The need of the hour is to conduct more tests so that those who test positive can be isolated,” he said.Conducting tests on a few people will be a waste of logistics; so, the minimum requirement of 20 people for the tests, a CMC official said.The civic body can conduct the tests in a locality as well if residents can provide an AC room and there are at least 20 people interested in taking the tests, the official said. The rapid antigen test is conducted to detect the presence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a person’s nasopharyngeal swab sample. The results arrive within 30-40 minutes whereas it takes one or two days for an RT-PCR test result.But the rapid antigen test is known to produce false negatives, which means someone who tests negative can actually be Covid positive.A symptomatic person who tests negative should undergo an RT-PCR test to confirm if she/he is actually negative, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines for rapid antigen tests.An asymptomatic person who tests negative in the antigen tests should be considered as not infected, the ICMR has said. Someone who tests positive need not undergo further tests and should be considered as Covid positive.Despite its deficiency, the ICMR has okayed rapid antigen tests because the results are available in 30 minutes. “Someone who tests positive in the test can be isolated soon.He/she will be asked to stay isolated at home if symptoms are mild. If such a person keeps mixing with others, he/she can spread the virus to more people. This is one of the reasons why antigen tests are being done,” a CMC doctor said.",2020-08-23 01:26:00
1214,Mita Mukherjee,NUJS cuts fees for monsoon semester - Telegraph India,"The National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) on Saturday reduced the fees for various facilities that students haven’t been using since the campus is closed and classes are being held online.The institute’s executive council, its highest policy-making body, decided to waive the fees for examinations, students’ welfare activities, moot courts, hostel accommodation and study materials.Students of all batches, excluding those of the incoming first year, will now have to pay around Rs 38,000 less for the July-December monsoon semester.“Students of all batches (excluding first year) will have to pay Rs 1.21 lakh instead of Rs 1.59 lakh for the current semester,” N. K. Chakrabarti, the NUJS vice-chancellor, said after the meeting of the executive council.Students, though, had demanded a waiver of up to Rs 48,000.“Several students have been talking of financial difficulties because of the pandemic. The executive council unanimously agreed to provide students with some relief. We have reduced the fees as much as possible,” Chakrabarti said.The institute does not receive any financial aid from the government. It depends entirely on student fees, a university official said.“It was not possible to accept all the demands of the students. The institute has been closed for five months. But we have had to pay full salaries to every member of our staff… and we will continue to do so in future,” the official said. “There was a proposal to reduce the library fees. But it could not be considered as ours is a law school and we have to maintain the library services even if the institute is shut.”Students had recently requested the authorities to reduce the fees under the heads they were not using because of online classes.The students’ proposal on the fee waiver has been placed before the institute’s finance committee. The committee had approved the proposal and forwarded it to the executive council for ratification.The vice-chancellor said a notice would be issued next week asking students to pay the reduced semester fees.Those who have already paid the fees will have the surplus amount adjusted with the fees for the next semester.The monsoon semester (July to December) online classes are being held from July.But the payment of semester fees has been kept on hold since July because of the students’ demand for a waiver.As of now the university has no plans to reduce the fees for the next semester that starts in January, the vice-chancellor said. “We will take a decision depending on the Covid situation at that time,” the vice-chancellor said.",2020-08-23 01:35:00
1215,Debraj Mitra,Increase in Kolkata rainfall for 2 more days - Telegraph India,"An already drenched city will have to grapple with “an increase in rainfall” on Sunday and Monday.A low-pressure area is expected to take shape over the Bay of Bengal by Sunday evening, a Met official said. Under its impact, the intensity of the rain is likely to go up from the second half of Sunday. “The next two days are likely to see an increase in rainfall in the city. Heavy rain is not ruled out,” the Met official said.Heavy rain in the city is much more likely if the low-pressure area forms over the north Bay, the official said. The other possibility is the Northwest Bay, in which case Odisha’s coastal areas will be more affected.The whole city received rain on Saturday, mainly in the afternoon. A few areas in the south were more drenched. Saturday’s rain was triggered by the monsoon trough, which now passes over Calcutta on its way to the Northeast Bay of Bengal, the Met official said. “Because of very strong monsoon currents, many thunderclouds had formed over the city. Some parts in the south had more thunderclouds.”Some bylanes around Bansdroni market were waterlogged, residents said. Less than 3km away, stretches of Kalighat had knee-deep water in the afternoon.For a second consecutive day, the rain coincided with high tide and water in the Adi Ganga breached banks and flooded nearby roads, a Calcutta Municipal Corporation official said. “In August and September, when the level of the Hooghly is already above normal, rain and high tide lead to more inundation,” said the official.Seven portable pumps had drained the water out by evening, said Tarak Singh, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators in charge of drainage.The forecast for more rain threatens to flood more areas. Singh said there was little the civic body could do if heavy rain and high tide came together. “But the waterlogging will not persist for days. We have 650 portable pumps to drain out water from low-lying areas,” he said.",2020-08-23 01:55:00

1217,Snehal Sengupta,Now streaming live: puja in the time of pandemic - Telegraph India,"A Salt Lake club on Saturday streamed live Ganesh Puja rituals to a giant LED screen near the PNB roundabout from a member’s house.The Yubak Sangha Club, which has held its puja at the same spot in the BA Block for the past 11 years, decided against erecting a pandal this year to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The giant screen has been fixed on a stage, along with speakers.As the streaming started in the morning, passers-by clicked photographs. Several residents in masks and caps stood with folded hands as club volunteers ensured there was no crowding.The men also put sanitisers on the hands of the visitors and asked everyone to maintain social distance. A set of masks was also kept at one corner and people could take one home.“The puja has become a regular fixture for people of our block. We were a bit sad that this year the organisers decided to do away with the pandal… but I quite liked the fact that all rituals were live-streamed here,” Rudrani Chatterjee, who lives in the AB Block, said.Chatterjee stepped out of her house in the afternoon, clicked a few photographs of the LED screen and a selfie with it in the background before going back home.At Maharashtra Niwas on Hazra Road, priests started the puja with a small Ganesh idol and a few devotees.The Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations organised by the Maharashtra Mandal is among the oldest in Calcutta, a tradition it has upheld since the 1930s. For Maharashtrians based in the city, the Hazra Road address is still the place to be during this time of the year.At Satyanarayan Park, the organisers of one of the biggest Ganesh Puja in the area decided to call off the celebrations. In Burrabazar, too, the celebrations were muted.In Salt Lake, the rituals were live-streamed to the LED screen from a house in the BB Block. A priest offered the puja to a small idol, along with a few puja organisers, one of whom acted as the cameraperson.“We set up a camcorder on a tripod. The images were streamed live to the screen… our regular electrician who deals in sound and video equipment helped us set it up,” Kaushik Chanda, one of the puja organisers, said.Another member of the club said the location of the house where the puja was held was “deliberately not made public”. “Many people would have landed up at the house to offer puja. We would not have been able to say no to anyone…. We did not want to take any chance during the pandemic.”A real estate developer in Salt Lake who is associated with the puja said the arrangement suited the club’s budget, which underwent a “huge cut” because of the pandemic.“We could not raise any subscriptions this year. We wouldn’t have been able to afford a large-scale puja,” the developer said. People can view the puja live on a Facebook page created by the organisers. Those willing to donate money can do so online; they will receive prasad, including khichdi, and hand sanitisers and masks delivered to their homes, an organiser said.The Salt Lake Maitri Sangha Club, which holds its puja in the CF Block, is doing with a small pandal this year.Former mayor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Sabyasachi Dutta is the president of club. The club decided to do away with big celebrations as people “would not step out”, he said. “We don’t want a huge gathering. We have an open pandal where people can get a glimpse of the rituals as they pass by.”",2020-08-23 02:11:00
1218,Sanjay Mandal,Covid patients can’t be evicted: West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission - Telegraph India,"A private hospital cannot ask a Covid patient to vacate the bed if the person is unable to pay an advance, the Bengal health regulatory commission said on Saturday in the wake of criticism over an earlier advisory.The earlier advisory had said that if the deposit was not made within 12 hours of admission, “the hospital would be at liberty to cancel the provisional admission and ask the patient party to take back the patient within one hour thereafter”.The commission chairperson, retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, said the “clarification” had been issued because the earlier advisory had been criticised.A senior doctor had told The Telegraph on August 10 that the legitimisation of “the deposit culture”, including the permission to ask for removal of patients within one hour after the 12-hour window, belied the commission’s mandate of protecting patients.After a meeting on Saturday, the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission issued the clarification that made it plain that a private hospital cannot deny treatment to a patient “under any situation, whether that person has paid a deposit or not”.Banerjee, the chairperson, said the commission had never intended patients to be asked to leave a hospital. “There was criticism from one side as if we had said that after 13 hours the patient should be thrown out. No act or law has given any hospital the licence that a patient will be thrown out of the hospital only for money,” the retired judge said.The earlier advisory had allowed private hospitals to demand from patients an advance of Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated cost of treatment, whichever was less, at the time of admission. The quantum of the deposit stands unchanged after the clarification.Banerjee told a news conference on Saturday: “Taking into consideration the criticism, as a clarification we issued Covid Advisory 11 today where we said that under no condition can a patient be denied treatment, whether that person pays a deposit or not. If despite that a clinical establishment feels it is facing any problem, then that clinical establishment can get in touch with Swasthya Bhavan (the state health department headquarters) or our commission.”He added: “During this Covid situation, it has been stated by the government that if any patient comes to a hospital, that person has to be treated. If the hospital does not have the infrastructure to treat the patient, then the condition of that person has to be stabilised and then (he or she can be) sent to a hospital with better facilities. At no point can treatment be denied to that patient.”Banerjee continued: “We were hearing about some hospitals taking advantage of the situation, demanding abnormal amounts of money as advance. To prevent that, we had issued an advisory, No. 9. But we had said that because of (failure to pay) the deposit, the patient’s treatment should not face any problems. At least that person should be given ample time — we had said ‘12 hours’. If he cannot pay even after that, more time should be given so that they can arrange for treatment elsewhere.”",2020-08-23 02:17:00
1219,Subhajoy Roy,Covid discount nudge to private hospitals - Telegraph India,"The state’s clinical establishment regulatory commission has asked private hospitals to offer Covid-19 patients discounts on the maximum retail price (MRP) of medicines and consumables to lessen the burden of bill on patients or their families.The commission has fixed at least 10 per cent discount on medicines and 20 per cent on consumables.If hospitals are unable to offer the discount, they should allow a patient’s family to buy medicines and consumables from outside where discounts are offered. The commission has found that medicines and consumables are among the costliest components of a Covid patient’s bill. The discounts will provide patients and their families with some relief, retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, said on Saturday. The members of the commission met at New Town on Saturday to discuss the matter, after which the commission issued a series of advisories, including the one on discounts. In another advisory, it asked hospitals to keep their bed charges at March 1 rates.“We know certain pharmacies and medicine stores offer discounts of up to 20 per cent. But hospitals are charging patients the MRP. So, we have asked hospitals to offer at least 10 per cent discount on medicines and at least 20 per cent discount on consumables on the MRP,” Banerjee said.“Hospitals should ask their pharmacies to offer the discount. In case the discount cannot be offered, hospitals should give a patient’s family the option of buying medicines and consumables from outside where discounts are available.”Medicines and consumables together make up between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of a Covid patient’s bill, an official of a private hospital in the city said. “If a patient is administered Remdesivir, an anti-viral drug, the bill is bound to shoot up. A course of six doses of this drug costs Rs 40,000,” the official said.“We have to give Remdesivir to any patient with moderate symptoms but whose condition starts to worsen. This drug has to be given at that juncture so that the condition does not become critical,” he said.The consumables include masks, PPEs, syringes and catheter. The contribution of consumables is higher in the bill of a Covid patient compared to patients with other  illnesses as doctors have to wear PPEs to treat Covid patients.The state government has capped PPE rates at Rs 1,000 per patient per day.Metro had on August 14 reported that insurance companies were refusing to pay the money spent on PPEs, face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers.The commission has requested hospitals to display their treatment rates for Covid patients in three prominent places on their premises, Banerjee said.In one of its advisories, the commission allowed doctors to charge an additional Rs 1,000 if they had to examine a Covid patient more than once in a day.“There was a capping on doctors’ consultation fee at Rs 1,000 per day. It was brought to our notice that in many cases a doctor had to examine a patient several times in a day,” Banerjee said. “We have allowed a doctor to charge another Rs 1,000 for more than one examination in a day. But the Rs 1,000 additional consultation fee will include any number of visits after the first visit.”",2020-08-23 02:35:00
1220,ABP Digital Brand Studio,Kingston Educational Institute-Career Aspirant’s dreams and aspirations are our objectives - Telegraph India,"Dreams forms the basis of a career aspirant’s upward trajectory towards career related goals and milestones. These dreams ought to be given shape, and Kingston Educational Institute (KEI) has always been at forefront to provide the necessary support for the future professionals of India. KEI has several constituents in the same campus, based in the heart of the Educational hub of Barasat, North 24 Parganas. The sprawling, picturesque campus covering an area of 30 acres of land is located in a semi-urban place surrounded by lush green meadow in the serenity of pollution free and eco-friendly environment. Founded in 2004,  under the visionary leadership of Late Utpal Bhattacharjee, Founder President of KEI and Mrs Uma Bhattacharjee, Secretary of KEI, the different colleges under the umbrella of Kingston Educational Institute are--“Kingston Law College”  providing Law Graduate (5 years) and 3 years Post Graduate Degree Course, “Kingston Polytechnic College” offering Diploma Engineering Courses of different disciplines includingMechanical Engineering, Automobile Engineering, Computer Science & Technology, Electrical Engineering and Electronics and Tele-communications. “Kingston School of Management and Science” offers B.Sc in  Hotel Management course, Bachelor in Business Management and Hospital Management, and BCA.“Kingston College of Science” offers BA and BSc Honours program in Microbiology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Biochemistry, Physics, Economics, Geography, Electronics, Food & Nutrition, library and Information science. “Kingston Teacher Training Institute”offers two years full time B.Ed programs. Kingston Model School, is a ICSE affiliated institution providing value based education from nursery to class 10th.  A virtual tour of the campus as well as the detailed information of the courses and resources can be seen by clicking on www.keical.edu.inThe aim and objective of the organization and management is to make the alumni employable and entrepreneurial while pursuing various academic programs at KEI.The institute conducts active projects and assignments by collaborating with the industry that provides the faculties to consult the industry practitioners, while making the students understand the practicalities through industry run projects, internships and on the job training exercises. All these have led to the students being placed in best of the organizations for internships and final placements year after year. The state of the art infrastructure, including the laboratories, equipment and business incubation center provide the learner the much needed resources so as to align with the employment related situations of this century. The faculty members comprises of senior professionals from the world of industry as well as academia along with academic advisories from India and overseas. This allow all the constituents to have a GLOCAL (GLOBAL plus LOCAL) model of teaching and learning culminating in making the graduates prepare for the national and international employment market.Even during the pandemic, all the constituents of KEI ensured there is a novel, uninterrupted education for all the students. All the constituents of Kingston Educational Institute (Kingston Polytechnic College, Kingston Science College, Kingston School of Management Science, Kingston Law College, Kingston Teacher's Training Academy, Kingston Model School, Kingtson's Skill Development Initiative) were one of the first educational institutes to embrace electronic learning. Kingston Educational Institute leveraged their pan-India and global contacts to use multi-platform based learning initiatives, including the likes of Learning Management System (LMS), YouTube Channel, Slideshare, Blogosphere, WhatsApp, Helpline and other multi-medias to provide quality education to the students, precisely following the college and school schedule, on a day to day basis. The academic rigour as well as the punctuality of the students and the teachers weren’t compromised and all the stakeholders understood the importance of work from home and college/school from home to a nicety. The classes were being conducted by the faculties through zoom, google classrooms, as well as the aforementioned tools after following the basics of instructional design as well as SCORM norms. Opines, Dr. Manishankar Chakraborty, Academic Advisor of Kingston, based in Dubai, ""The effort put in by the KEI family to ensure none of the students are deprived of learning and growth during this moment of crisis speaks volumes of the commitment of the management as well as all the staff members"". All the classes are being individually monitored by a crack team having hands on expertise in learning and development, so as to measure their effectiveness, from a qualitative and quantitative standpoint. Regular feedback is being sought through surveys, discussion forums from the students, their parents and peers from the academic fraternity, so as to ensure the quality is enhanced periodically. Mr. Tipam Bhattacharjee, President of KEI was forthright when we commented, KEI ensures that knowledge reaches every nook and corner of the country, in order to have the developmental curve of the pupils intact, even during this moment of crisis. This was evident from the process based approach followed by Kingston while ideating, customizing and implementing electronic learning, catering to the specific needs of their pupils. Value added initiatives by networking with industry professionals and academic experts, as well as professionals provided the students with numerous self-help developmental platforms. In order to reach out to the masses who are probably stranded at home, devoid of education, Kingston has also started free electronic tutoring, electronic mentoring and electronic counseling by their in-house experts as well as the external resources targeting all the class 10th, class11th and class 12th students of India. The students registered in https://keical.edu.in/elearning/ and sought need based educational as well as academic support at absolutely free of cost. Furthermore, the emphasis of holistic learning that has always been the key foundation at Kingston was brought to the fore when the group's secretary, Mrs. Uma Bhattacharjee provided with a competition based learning opportunity whereby, the students can develop their extra-curricular activities by registering in the link https://keical.edu.in/compete-for-excellence/.at no cost. She added that such activities are the fulcrum for the students to activate lateral thinking as well as the development of an analytical mindset. The group has also requested the governments of West Bengal, Tripura and Megalaya to provide free teaching-learning support to all the class 10th, 11th and 12th students of those respective states. The whole electronic learning experience and the sojourn thus far was aptly summed up by the Academic Chairman of Kingston Group, Prof (Dr.) Ambarnath Banerji when we said, Kingston is always for the students, who are the torchbearers of the society and Covid-19 cannot defeat us in achieving our objectives of being the facilitators of learning 24x7x365!Furthermore, all the constituents of KEI has ensured uninterrupted value added learning and development for the pupils, faculties and the community at large by roping in national and international experts from the industries as well as the world of academia. The dedicated YouTube channel , Facebook page(www.facebook.com/keduins) provide all the recordings of these events free for the usage of the in house audience as well as the society.

1221,Our Special Correspondent,Kolkata weather forecast: Rain and flooding alert from today  - Telegraph India,"Rainfall in Calcutta and surrounding areas is likely to increase from Monday because of a low-pressure area that is set to form over the north Bay of Bengal by Monday, Met officials said on Sunday.Under its influence, the entire south Bengal, including Calcutta, is expected to get widespread rain from Monday.The system was to have formed on Sunday. “It is a dynamic process and depends on several parameters like atmospheric pressure over the sea and the sea surface temperature,” said a Met official.The city got light but persistent rain throughout Sunday. The sky remained overcast since morning. The intensity of the showers is likely to go up from Monday, said a Met official.The previous low-pressure system had led to around 115mm of rain in Calcutta between August 17 morning and August 21 morning.“The fresh system is also likely to trigger over 100mm of rain in Calcutta over the next three days. One heavy spell is due,” said the official.The Met office has warned of “a rise in the water levels of the rivers and waterlogging of low-lying areas” because of the rain. Officials of the civic body in Calcutta said if heavy rain coincided with high tide, waterlogging was inevitable in low-lying areas.“But once the rain stops, there are enough pumps to drain the water out quickly,” said an official.The fresh low-pressure area is likely to travel westwards. As a result, the western districts of Bengal such as Bankura, Purulia and Jhargram can get heavy rain on Wednesday and Thursday.The monsoon trough extends up to northeastern Bay of Bengal via Calcutta. That is leading to strong monsoon currents in the city, said a Met official.",2020-08-24 01:26:00
1222,Snehal Sengupta,Wi-Fi hotspots for Kolkata's New Town road - Telegraph India,"At least six new Wi-Fi hotspots will be set up in various places along the Major Arterial Road (MAR) of New Town, said an official of Hidco, which builds infrastructure in the township.According to the official, the places that have been shortlisted for setting up the hotspots include Eco Park, Eco Urban Village, community markets and zones such as the Unitech intersection which have a number of offices.“The idea is to provide a seamless high-speed Internet connectivity across the township and these new Wi-Fi hotspots will be a step towards it,” the official said.Users can log into the network using either smart phones or laptops.Most of the Wi-Fi hotspots will be solar powered and fitted with a back-up system powered by conventional power. The back-up system will keep the hotspots active on days the solar panels cannot generate enough power or malfunction.The decision to extend the Wi-Fi  coverage across various areas in the township was taken keeping in mind it's relatively younger population compared to other parts of the city, as well as the fact that all action areas in New Town have a large number of offices, colleges and universities.Small public data offices will also be set up in community markets that will be able to extend Wi-Fi services to the locality against a small fee.Hidco chairman Debashis Sen said they wanted to create an ecosystem that will enable people to finish assignments while travelling. “It is important to ensure that since most offices are encouraging people to work from home,” said Sen.“Wi-Fi connectivity is already available on the Major Arterial Road. This new network will bolster it.”Many New Town residents said the Wi-Fi network available along the Major Arterial Road was ""glitchy"".""I used to get good speeds earlier but of late the network has become quite bad and logging in is a task in itself,"" said Maitreyee Bhattacharya, a techie and a resident of New Town.The New Town authorities are also in talks with technology experts to have a high-speed broadband Internet in Bengal Silicon Valley in order to draw in data-centre developers, ISP providers, gaming and mobile application companies as well as telecom players to set up offices there.“Every sector needs stable and high-speed Internet connections and we want new-age companies like those developing games and mobile applications, among others, to set up their offices in New Town,” said a Hidco official.Hidco had floated an expression of interest (EoI) for allotting land at the Bengal Silicon Valley IT hub in New Town in May.According to the EoI, 22 plots spread over 63.35 acres are being offered in the fifth phase of land allotment at Bengal Silicon Valley. The largest plot is 21.75 acres. All plots are available on a 99-year leasehold basis.Hidco officials said that they had received one serious enquiry for the setting up of a data centre there. Out of the total 200 acres of land, there are about 169 acres of allotable land, excluding the roads and commercial space. Some companies who have already applied for plots in the previous phases are Reliance Jio (40 acres), CTS (25 acres), TCS (20 acres), Capgemini (7 acres), Indian Statistical Institute and others.",2020-08-24 01:28:00
1223,Subhankar Chowdhury,Presidency University tweaks criteria for humanities - Telegraph India,"Presidency University has decided to allow students from the ISC-ICSE council to apply to study undergraduate courses in five humanities subjects even if they didn’t have math and science in their Class X course.Till the condition was withdrawn on Thursday, the university was not allowing ICSE candidates who had pursued pure humanities from Class IX to apply to study undergraduate courses in humanities. Those candidates had written to the Presidency authorities drawing their attention to the problem they were facing.The ISC-ICSE council allows students to study pure humanities, and no science subjects at all, from Class IX.The university has tweaked the format allowing applicants not to mention the marks of math and science at the secondary level while applying to study honours in English, history, political science, Bengali and Hindi, an official of the university said.However, three departments — sociology, philosophy and performing arts — will still give weightage to the marks in mathematics in the Class X board exams while drawing up the merit list. “The students who will apply to study any of these courses will have to mention their math marks in the Class X board exams,” the official said.But why are these three departments, unlike other humanities departments, still giving weightage to Class X math marks?“Those studying these subjects need to have sound logical and analytical skills. Till last year, the admission tests for these subjects would focus on such skills. Since admission tests are not being held this year because of the Covid pandemic, the departments are giving weightage to the candidates’ math marks in the Class X board exams to assess their logical and analytical skills,” the official said.“As the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the CBSE do not offer the option of pursuing pure humanities from Class IX, the students of these boards did not encounter any problem. Now, we have introduced a mechanism whereby an applicant can keep the columns of science subjects blank while applying for the five humanities subjects,” another Presidency official.The schools affiliated to the ICSE council ask students whether they want to pursue pure humanities when they are promoted from Class VIII to IX. “Sometimes students make up their mind to pursue pure humanities from Class IX and do not want to burden themselves with science subjects,” he said.Why did this provision of the council escape the attention of the Presidency authorities?A professor said Presidency did not have to factor in the marks of the secondary board exams as students over the past four years were being admitted on the basis of admission tests only.Before that, students used to be admitted on the basis of equal weightage to the admission test and plus-II board scores.As admissions tests are not being held this year, the authorities decided to consider the Class X and Class XII board exam scores while drawing up the merit lists. “While finalising the eligibility criteria, this provision of the council escaped our attention,” he said.",2020-08-24 01:31:00
1224,Our Special Correspondent,"Driver ill and falls off,  bus runs into tree in Kolkata - Telegraph India","The driver of a government bus fell off the vehicle apparently after suffering a stroke near the Maidan, while the bus kept moving for about 200 metres till it smashed into a tree on Dufferin Road on Sunday morning.The eight-odd passengers on the bus escaped unhurt. Police said a major accident could be averted because the bus was moving slowly.Driver Mangal Mondal, 44, a resident of Falta in South 24-Parganas, died later in the day at SSKM Hospital. Police said he died of his aliment and the injuries he suffered from his fall.“The accident happened at the crossing of Outram Road and Dufferin Road around 8.45am, when no other vehicle was on the stretch. The driver fell around 10 to 12 feet,” a traffic police officer said.The bus on route number S-4C was on its way to Haridevpur from Howrah station when the accident happened.“Initially, we thought the driver had fallen off the bus because the door beside his seat was defective. But later we discovered that he had taken ill. We took the driver to SSKM Hospital, where attending doctors said the symptoms he displayed were that of a stroke,” said an officer of Maidan police station.Senior officers of the traffic department failed to recall the last time a bus met with an accident after its driver had fallen off the vehicle.“Had the bus been moving at a higher speed, which was only normal on an empty stretch like the one where the accident happened, the consequences could have been disastrous. Fortunately, the bus was moving slowly and none of the seven-eight passengers on the bus did not suffer any injury,” an officer of the traffic department said.  The vehicle was taken to Maidan police station, where it will undergo a mechanical examination.“It is important to find out whether there was any defect in the gate beside the driver’s seat. We are also analysing the CCTV footage of the area to see how the driver’s door suddenly opened. Such defects, if any, could be dangerous to any driver,” another officer of the traffic department said.",2020-08-24 01:32:00
1225,Kinsuk Basu,New Market: 1 in 5 shops close - Telegraph India,"Inside his small shop in New Market, Pradip Kumar Shaw would usually find it difficult to spare time for a cup of tea around this time of the year. Customers would crowd in rows inside his shop looking for various home appliances, from mixer-grinders to air ovens, and he would be busy attending to them.On Saturday, a day after two back-to-back lockdowns, the man in his early sixties sat on a chair outside his shop, his face covered with a mask, counting hours. Shaw was one of the few who had opened their shops.“About one in five shopkeepers in New Market are not opening their establishments,” said Debu Bhattacharya, the secretary of the New Market Traders’ Association.For many, keeping the shops open doesn’t make sense. All have been reeling from a sharp drop in footfall and returns since the Covid-19 pandemic struck and struggling to pay wages to their staff.New Market has never seen such times in living memory.“Never ever,” said Shib Shankar Nandan, who has been running their family’s watch shop at New Market, along with his grandfather, for over five decades. Some of Calcutta’s most prized watches would get repaired at their shop. Not anymore.The 144-year-old shopping address in central Calcutta has 27 entrances and exits covering various zones, including the old market complex, multi-storeyed new complex, masala patti, vegetable market and the poultry-fish-meat area.Ahead of festivals such as Id, Durga Puja and Christmas, these entrances and exits would hum with the cacophony of buyers turning up from across the city as well as neighbouring districts. At other times, nearly 40 per cent of the 50,000-odd daily visitors to New Market would be from Bangladesh.All that has gone missing. Corridors are no more humming with buyers talking aloud or children screaming at the top of their voices. All the fashionable apparels the mannequins are decked out with have no takers.“The fear (of getting infected by the coronavirus) is so deep that even those who would earlier visit the place at least once a month have not turned up even once since mid-March. There is hardly any transaction throughout the day,” said Bhattacharya, of the New Market Traders’ Association. “Owners open their shops hoping against hope. But it doesn’t work.”Just how bad is it?Most shops have staff engaged on weekly contracts for wages varying between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500 a week. Around this time, when festivals are around the corner, many shops would engage more hands to cope with the demand.“I managed to sell just a lighter, for Rs 60, in the entire day,” said shop owner Shaw. “What will I pay my staff?”With lanes dimly lit and frighteningly empty, most shop owners at New Market who open their shops usually end up discussing the owners who had not turned up for the day.“We count the shops that are closed for the day ... G-108, G-109, E-110, G-12...” said the owner of a shop that sells suit pieces.Some owners said they were trapped in the decades-old tradition of keeping the shutters up.“It has never been so bad in the last four decades,” said Jagadish Halder, the manager at Nahoum’s and Sons Private Limited. Sale of cakes and other popular items have dipped drastically, casting a cloud of uncertainty on survival. “Still, we keep the shop open. It’s an age-old tradition for us.”Others hope that the pandemic would end some day and New Market would spring back to life.“The market is scarily quiet and there is no business,” said Tshering Yangki of Chamba Lamba, which sells silver jewellery. “We only hope that this will come to an end some day.”“If it continues like this, many of us would find it difficult to foot the electric bills,” said Ashim Bardhan, a shop owner.For years, most traders at New Market would usually complain about lack of adequate parking space posing a challenge to a section who enjoyed marketing in the afternoons.Parking space is no more a problem now. There aren’t buyers who will park their cars.",2020-08-24 01:34:00
1226,Kinsuk Basu ,Kolkata housing complex rapid tests begin - Telegraph India,"The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Sunday started its drive to conduct the rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 in housing complexes by sending a team to Surjakiran, a complex in north Calcutta’s Paikpara.The civic body had on Saturday announced that it would conduct antigen tests for free at housing complexes if at least 20 residents in each were willing to be tested.Sixty-two residents of Surjakiran, on Umakanta Sen Lane, underwent the test. All were negative, a CMC official said.Residents of the complex requested the CMC to conduct the tests a few days back. On Friday, the CMC informed them that a team would visit their complex Sunday.“After the CMC responded to our requests, we spread the message around. Sixty-two of the 125-odd residents underwent the test,” said Amitabha Panda, the secretary of the residents’ welfare association of Surjakiran.The antigen test can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, in a person’s nasopharyngeal swab sample. The result of an antigen test comes in 30 to 40 minutes, compared to one or two days it takes for the result of the more confirmatory RT-PCR test to arrive.For the RT-PCR test, a person’s nasopharyngeal as well as oropharyngeal swab samples are collected.The rapid test is known to throw up many false negatives, which means that someone whotests negative in the test could actually be infected by the virus. The guidelines for the rapid antigen test issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said a symptomatic person testing negative should undergo an RT-PCR test.An asymptomatic person who tests negative in the antigen tests should be considered uninfected, the guidelines said. Someone who tests positive need not undergo further tests and is considered Covid positive.Despite its deficiency, the rapid tests have been approved because they give results in 30 minutes and help in faster isolation of infected people, said a CMC doctor.Panda, of Surjakiran, said none of the residents had to undergo an RT-PCR test.Santanu Sen, a past national president of the Indian Medical Association and a member of the CMC’s Covid core team, said the authorities were trying to take testing to the doorsteps to increase the number of tests.“More and more tests is our strategy,” he said. “If someone tests negative in the antigen tests but has symptoms of Covid-19, we will collect her/his samples for the RT-PCR test.”The CMC had on Saturday said that residents would have to provide an air-conditioned (AC) room if they wanted the civic body to send a testing team to their housing complex.The AC room is needed for the personal protective equipment -clad medical technologists to work comfortably. Panda said the samples were collected in the office room of the residents’ welfare association.",2020-08-24 01:41:00
1227,Kinsuk Basu ,Hospital uploading order  on Covid patient vitals  - Telegraph India,"The health department has asked all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients to ensure that the vital signs of all admitted to intensive care units, cardiac care units and high dependency units are uploaded on the Covid Patient Management System four times a day.The circular, sent to all government and private hospitals, says the vital parameters of critical patients have to be uploaded twice a day and those of others, once a day.The data will have to be fed into the patient monitoring score in the newly-launched software — Covid Patient Management System. Senior health department officials said the directive comes at a time when several hospitals were allegedly failing to upload the details, leaving a team of experts at Sasthya Bhavan in the dark about the condition of critically ill Covid-19 patients across the state.“Unless the parameters are uploaded, it is not possible to monitor whether a hospital is regularly checking all the vital parameters of a patient in ICU, such as his or her oxygen saturation level in the blood and electrolyte balance,” said a senior health department official.“Our team of experts wouldn’t know if a patient is getting the proper treatment or is fit enough to be moved out of the ICU.”A team of experts from the health department observed while visiting various Covid hospitals recently that nurses assigned the task of feeding information into the new software were not doing so at regular intervals.In a few cases, patients who could be moved out of ICUs were being kept back because the doctors were not ready to take the responsibility of continuous monitoring in wards.As a result relatives of patients were unable to ascertain their status online.",2020-08-24 01:45:00

The rest has to be paid by October 15.Till last year, a student of the master of business management programme was required to pay Rs 35,000 during admission. “This year, they can pay Rs 15,000 by August 25 and the rest by October 15,” said a university official.The August 25 deadline for payment of the first installment is for those who can pay online. One can also pay offline on the Haringhata campus of the university or at the Salt Lake office on August 25, 26 and 27.“Those having online payment related issues, can avail any of the places as per their convenience. The timings are from 11am to 1pm only as banking hours have been reduced to 2pm,” says the notice by the registrar.“This facility (staggered payment of the semester-cum-admission fee) is being extended only to those who are facing fund crunch due to this COVID-19 pandemic and not to consider this gesture on part of the university as a general one,” reads the notice signed by registrar Lahiri.He said that the university had received appeals from prospective students who have been selected through CET-1 (Common Entrance Test) and JEMAT (joint entrance management aptitude test) for a relaxation in payment of fees on the ground that they are facing financial constraints because of the pandemic.“After going through the appeal, the university decided to introduce the mechanism of payment through instalments,” said Lahiri.Many of the students who had appealed for relaxation have told the university that earning members in their families had a part of their salary reduced after the start of the lockdown. Some said their family members had lost jobs.The National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, will let students pay tuition fees in instalments in the coming semester to give its students a relief amid the crisis.A meeting of the NIT’s deans’ council has decided that 60 per cent of the tuition fee of Rs 62,500 has to be paid by September 30 and the rest by December 15.",2020-08-24 01:54:00

1230,Sanjay Mandal,East Midnapore's 17-year-old girl's new life with a new heart - Telegraph India,"A 17-year-old girl from a village in East Midnapore is looking ahead to a life with a new heart.Ahsana Khatun walked without support for the first time on Monday since undergoing a heart transplant a week ago. After that almost symbolic demonstration of her will to stand on her own feet, Ahsana told Metro that she was keen to return to school at the earliest and write Madhyamik next year.She could not sit for her Class X boards this year because her heart was incapable of taking the strain.The resident of Kumarpur village in East Midnapore underwent the transplant at Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in Howrah on August 17. A week on, she walked slowly without any support, said doctors.“The first thing I want to do after recovering fully is go back to school. I could not sit for Madhyamik this year because of my illness. But I want to write the papers next year,” Ahsana said on Monday from her hospital bed.About two years back she was diagnosed with dialectic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart’s pumping muscles keep weakening and the organ fails to pump adequate blood to the rest of the body.Doctors said Ahsana would suffer from severe respiratory distress as fluids accumulate in the lungs, along with other organs. The condition, which doctors said leads to heart failure, forced Ahsana to miss classes as she needed to be admitted to hospital often.“I had been feeling unwell for the last three years and would frequently miss school and could not play with my sisters and brothers,” said Ahsana, a Class X student of Omarpur High Madrasa.When she was in Class VI, Ahsana had developed a hearing problem that still persists. “My parents had then said I must  complete my education. Once I fully recover, I want to get back to school and study as far as I can,” said Ahsana, whose favourite read is Tagore’s poetry.Ahsana’s condition had been worsening over the past two years as her heart was steadily losing its capacity to pump blood. “She had to be admitted to hospital four times over the past three months because of heart failures. About four months back, we enlisted her for heart transplant,” said Debasis Das, the cardiac surgeon who led the transplant team that operated on Ahsana for four hours.“Every time she was admitted to hospital, we would give her some medicine and discharge her. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we didn’t want to keep her in hospital for long.”Along with Das, cardiac surgeon Nilanjan Dutta and pediatric cardiologist Amitabha Chattopadhyay treated the patient.Ahsana said she would always leave the hospital depressed. “I would feel very depressed after reaching home from the hospital. I would be anxious about what would happen to me. Then I would sit and listen to Tagore songs,” she said.Finally, on the evening of August 16, the hospital got a call from an official of the regional organ and tissue transplant organisation of the state health department that a young man had died and his organs were donated by his family. The parameters matched Ahsana’s.“We contacted Ahsana’s father and asked him whether he could bring her to Calcutta as soon as possible. He hired a vehicle and reached the hospital with his daughter,” said Das.The heart was harvested from the donor’s body at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.“In about two to three months, Ahsana would be able to go back to near-normal life, including attending classes,” said Das.Ahsana said she was feeling much better than she had in the past three years. “I can’t wait to go back home, this time cured,” she said.Her father, Sk Hidayatullah, the imam of a mosque in East Midnapore, said he had been worried about the cost of treatment of Ahsana, the eldest of his three daughters.“I went to SSKM Hospital but could not get her treated. I was worried about how to raise money for her treatment but said yes when doctors at the private hospital asked whether I wanted my daughter to be treated there,” he said.The hospital authorities later told him that he need not pay anything and they would take care of her cost of treatment.“The total cost of her treatment was around Rs 10 lakh. Our patient support cell helped in raising funds through donors and various funding agencies. The rest of the cost was borne by the hospital,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, which runs the Howrah hospital.",2020-08-25 01:39:00
1231,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Mamata worried over Covid in North 24-Parganas  - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday expressed concern about the Covid-19 situation in North 24-Parganas and the “very high” positivity rate there.Mamata warned officials at a televised meeting that parts of the district were densely populated and asked them to take adequate measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. She also asked elected representatives from the district to be more vigilant.The positivity rate — percentage of tests turning out to be positive — gives a measure of the spread of a disease in the community, public health specialists said.“The positivity rate is 20.6 per cent in the district. Why is the situation in North 24-Parganas still not under control? There are some urban areas and some rural areas in the district. A lot of dengue cases are also reported from the district every year,” Mamata said during an administrative review meeting held through videoconferencing and attended by officials of a number of south Bengal districts.“Are the zilla parishad chief, the MLAs taking care of their areas? The municipalities should be careful. I will tell the urban (development and municipal affairs) department to be especially careful. This (North 24-Parganas) is a very densely populated district. There are too many people living within a small area. You have to ensure that the positivity rate goes down,” she said, addressing officials from the district.The state health department’s bulletin on Covid-19 states that 700 cases were reported from the district on Monday and 696 on Sunday. The district reported the highest number of new cases in the state on both these days.“For a few days now, North 24-Parganas is reporting more cases than Calcutta,” said a health department official. The district was reporting between 500 and 600 cases every day about a fortnight back.Officials later said densely populated pockets such as Dum Dum, Barasat, Barrackpore and the areas off VIP Road were a concern. Sources in the district’s health administration said all these places had been reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases.The chief minister went on to add that the discharge rate among Covid patients and the death rate in the district were 77.2 and 2.2 per cent, respectively.She also cited the positivity rates of some districts that were lower compared with that of North 24-Parganas. Mamata said the positivity rates in Howrah, Hooghly and South 24-Parganas were 13.7, 8.3 and 7.9 per cent, respectively.“A high positivity rate means the right people, those with symptoms, are being tested. It leads to faster isolation of infected people,” said a public health specialist.",2020-08-25 01:41:00
1232,Subhankar Chowdhury,CM Mamata Banerjee appeals to PM Modi: defer entry tests - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to assess the “enormous health risk involved” and put on hold the national entrance examinations due in September “until the situation is conducive again”.“On the one hand, the Covid-19 pandemic is going on and the student community on the other hand is... suffering a lot of mental agony and depression…. I would therefore appeal to you to get the enormous health risk involved in such steps assessed,” Mamata wrote in her letter to Modi.She added: “The central government must not take a decision for which the students feel upset and also ensure that students are not deprived of the opportunity to take examinations. I am sure that you will appreciate the point and postpone these examinations until the situation is conducive again.”The JEE-Main exams, through which most engineering colleges admit undergraduate students, are to be held from September 1 to 6. The National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), through which all medical colleges admit undergraduate students, is scheduled for September 13.Earlier in the day, Mamata tweeted her concern about holding the exams amid the pandemic.An official of the state education department said the health risk arose from the fact that the aspirants would have to turn up at centres to write the test at a time any kind of physical assembly is being discouraged as a precaution against Covid.“Although the authorities that conduct the exams have issued guidelines on the precautionary measures to be taken by the candidates and others, any assembly can pose a risk. That’s why the chief minister appealed for postponing the tests,” the official said.Covid-19 cases are on the rise in all eight cities and towns in Bengal where exam centres will be set up, an official said.The National Testing Agency — which conducts all-India entrance exams such as JEE-Mains, JEE-Advanced and NEET — has said that each candidate will be offered a three-layered mask before he or she enters the venue. Also, before entering the centre, each candidate will have to wash their hands with soap and water or clean them with sanitiser.The chief minister in her letter sought to underscore that she was appealing for postponement of the entrance tests for the same reason that prompted her to oppose the UGC’s instruction to the colleges and universities to conduct their terminal exams by the end of September.Mamata concluded her letter by saying: “It is our duty as elders to ensure a safe public environment for all our students in the country.”",2020-08-25 01:43:00

Under its influence, widespread rainfall is likely to occur over the districts of south Bengal between August 24 and 27,” said a Met bulletin on Monday afternoon.The system is likely to travel westwards passing over the northern fringe of Calcutta between Tuesday evening and early Wednesday. “Between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, at least one spell of heavy rain is due in the city,” a Met official said.The city was bracing for heavy rain on Monday as well, but the morning was dry and sunny. The sky started becoming overcast in the afternoon and showers started by evening in many parts of the city. The Met office recorded around 30mm of rain in Alipore till 8.30pm on Monday.The system is expected to travel westwards from the Bay. Bengal’s western districts are likely to get more rain from Wednesday, the official said.",2020-08-25 01:45:00
1234,"Monalisa Chaudhuri, Snehal Sengupta",Coronavirus outbreak: Durga Puja questions vex complexes - Telegraph India,"Residential complexes across the city are divided on how to celebrate Durga Puja amid the Covid-19 pandemic: to have idols like every year or just a ceremonial ghot. And what about cultural programmes that almost every complex organises on Puja evenings?As health authorities have advised against gatherings to prevent infection, WhatsApp has emerged as the platform of choice for residents to discuss and debate on how big or small Puja should be this year.WhatsApp groups of many residential complexes are simmering with ideas and counter-ideas on whether it would be prudent to organise just a ghot Puja (worshipping an earthen pot) and how safe it would be to go ahead with cultural programmes and community lunch. “Some residents have suggested that we only perform ghot Puja. But most are in favour of traditional idol worship. We have already placed an order for the idols,” said a resident of Upohar — the Condoville, off EM Bypass.Residents at Sanjeeva Town Bungalows and Duplex in New Town are divided on how to organise community lunch this year. Rajoshi Gupta, who lives in the complex, said a section of the residents wanted food to be served in boxes that could be taken home. Others are lobbying for food to be served outside the pandal like previous years.Some New Town complexes such as Rosedale Garden, however, have decided to do away with community lunch.In the absence of any guidelines from the administration on the Durga Puja celebrations inside housing complexes, most residents’ welfare associations Metro spoke to are still struggling to strike a balance between tradition and safety.The associations of some big housing complexes expressed helplessness, saying they were struggling their way through a multitude of opposing views to a decision acceptable to all.Recently, Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations at Urbana, off the Bypass, attracted protests and criticisms from many residents. “There was a lot of hue and cry on the way Ganesh Puja was organised. Some residents wanted to celebrate, others did not. As for Durga Puja, we are still undecided on whether to organise cultural events. Most probably we will try live streaming of performances,” said a member of the residents’ welfare association of Urbana.The housing complex has already placed an order for the Puja idols, which will be worshipped in a 10,000sq ft space inside the complex.“We will have to prepare a protocol. Everyone is suggesting that we reduce the scale of celebrations,” another resident said.South City is likely to organise their Durga Puja meeting on a virtual platform on Tuesday. Sources said that although nothing had yet been decided on whether to organise cultural events, several residents have started rehearsing at home.The residents’ welfare association of Avishikta-I, on the Bypass, has declared there would be no cultural events this year. “A resident has donated the idols’ price. So, we have placed an order for the idols. Nothing else has been finalised. But there will be no cultural programme this year,” said a member of the residents’ welfare association of Avishikta-I.Sherwood Estate in Narendrapur has formed a committee for all pujas, from Ganesh Puja till next year’s Saraswati Puja.The residents’ welfare association had invited participation from residents to organise the events.“Those who wish to participate and work for the Puja preparations have volunteered. There is no compulsion,” said a resident of Sherwood Estate.",2020-08-25 01:54:00
1235,Our Special Correspondent,Molested in app cab over AC in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A woman has alleged that an app cab driver molested her on Sunday night when she asked him to switch on the car’s AC after finding it difficult to breathe.The driver was arrested based on a complaint she lodged with Garfa police station.The driver, Raj Shaw, 23, has been booked for outraging a woman’s modesty and criminal intimidation.A court on Monday remanded him in judicial custody for two days. The police said the driver has claimed that he works for Uber.The woman in her mid-30s was returning home to Selimpur with her husband from her parent’s home in Behala on Sunday night when the alleged offence took place, police said.A Uber spokesperson told Metro on Monday night: “This is a regrettable incident. Safety of all our riders and driver-partners is paramount. We are investigating the matter and stand ready to assist the law enforcement authorities in any way possible.”The couple had booked the cab in Taratala and immediately after boarding the cab, the woman asked the driver to switch on the AC. The driver did not turn it on and after about a kilometre, the couple asked the driver why he hadn’t switched on the AC, the police said.The driver apparently refused to switch on the AC.The woman insisted on the AC because she suffers from asthma, she said in her complaint to the police. It was getting difficult to breathe inside the cab, she told the police.The woman said an argument broke out between them and the driver. The driver apparently told them it was “quite cool” outside and that there was no need for the AC.As the couple insisted he switch on the AC, the driver said there was no such rule that said he had to meet a passenger’s unjust demands.When the couple said they would call on the app cab company’s helpline to find out if it was so, the driver dialled the number from his phone.“The couple said the driver was told on the phone that he had to switch on the AC if a passenger demanded so and in this case, in the mode should be ‘fresh air’,” an officer of Garfa police station said. “She alleged that the driver still refused to switch on the AC.”The driver took out his phone and kept taking their pictures in the “video mode” every time he stopped at a traffic signal, she alleged in her complaint with the police.The driver apparently stopped the car on Prince Anwar Shah Road near Jadavpur police station and slapped the woman as her husband protested. He then called some youths of the area and a few of his fellow drivers and threatened to thrash the couple. It was around 10pm and there weren’t too many people on the road.“The couple spotted a traffic sergeant on a bike. They stopped him and narrated their plight. The officer advised them to file a complaint at Garfa police station,” an officer said.",2020-08-25 01:56:00
1236,Subhajoy Roy,"CM Mamata Banerjee flags bad roads, calls for repairs - Telegraph India","Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday raised the matter of battered roads in the city and neighbouring areas during an administrative review meeting in Nabanna.She said she had found the top coat of a road missing while on her way to Nabanna a few days ago. She spoke of a road in Howrah’s Kona that was repaired only after she travelled on the road and messaged the municipal authorities regarding its poor state.“A few days ago I found the top layer of a road I took totally worn off. The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) is its custodian. I found a road in Kona in poor condition. The municipality repaired the road only after they were told,” she said.Battered roads have been greeting people across the city for many days.The Telegraph had on August 12 reported about the poor condition of some of Calcutta’s roads. Engineers of several state government agencies had blamed the absence of repairs ahead of the monsoon during the pandemic for the condition of the roads.Every year, roads in the city are repaired twice — before the monsoon and before Durga Puja. This year, the repairs ahead of the monsoon could not be carried out in most places because of the lockdown.April and May are the crucial period for repairs, according to engineers from the PWD, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.“I had to take the Park Circus-Parama Island connector on Monday as cops were not allowing motorists to take the Parama flyover from the Park Circus seven-point crossing,” a state government employee said.He was headed home to New Garia on his two-wheeler from his office in Esplanade. “The ride through the connector was a nightmare. The road was flooded and there were multiple deep craters… it was difficult to ride my two-wheeler on the road. I could have fallen but fortunately that did not happen.”Long stretches on the Bypass, especially the ones near the Ruby and Avishikta crossings, are dotted with large craters. Motorists and two-wheeler riders have a hard time negotiating craters on the road.Mamata asked government officials on Monday to pass on the message of the need to repair roads in poor condition. “Keep your eyes open when you are travelling. It maybe that your department doesn’t maintain the road but you can pass on the message to the department concerned for repairs.”",2020-08-25 02:05:00
1237,Our Bureau,Coronavirus outbreak: Pre-lockdown jam; water blamed - Telegraph India,"Tens of thousands of vehicles were stranded in central Calcutta on Monday — the picture reminiscent of the days before the lockdown when commuting in the heart of the city was often a nightmare.A Lake Gardens resident started for Esplanade, about 9km away, from her home around 5.10pm. She reached her destination at 6.55pm. It takes about 30 minutes otherwise to cover the distance during the lockdown.Police blamed a 300m waterlogged stretch at the crossing of Central Avenue and MG Road for the traffic snarl 5km away.Ranjan Sarkar who had boarded a bus for Park Street from Minto Park around 5.30pm said he was stuck in the bus for more than 45minutes to cover the distance that he usually does in 15 minutes.Traffic police officers said waterlogging at the crossing of MG Road and Central Avenue was responsible for the snarl.“Once there is waterlogging on roads, vehicles tend to avoid that stretch and start moving in a single file… and their speed automatically drops. Waterlogged footpaths mean pedestrians, too, walk on the roads,” a traffic police officer said.A bus that broke down near Howrah bridge apparently hit traffic on MG Road and the ripple effect was felt on Central Avenue as well, another officer said.Traffic moving on one flank made matters worse for commuters. The north-bound flank was waterlogged; so, the south-bound traffic was not affected that much, the police said.A person who was waiting for a bus at the KC Das crossing said vehicles approaching from the side of the Park Street flyover were moving “very slowly”. “There was no waterlogging in sight. But all vehicles were moving at a very slow pace. As far as I could see, there were vehicles lined up all over this flank of Central Avenue,” he said.A professional who was headed home said he had to wait for 40 minutes at Esplanade before he could get a Barrackpore-bound bus.Tarak Singh, a member of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, in charge of drainage, said the area had received more than 40mm rain in an hour and the place was prone to waterlogging. “But we have done our best to clear it. All the water was drained out by 7.30pm,” Singh said.The number of vehicles on the roads has gone down in the past few months because of the lockdown. Several police officers posted on Central Avenue, Park Street and in the Park Circus area said the volume of traffic on Monday was greater than other days during the pandemic.“It (increased traffic) could be because it was the first weekday after four days of consecutive holidays last week (two days of complete lockdown before the weekend),” a traffic police officer said.",2020-08-25 02:11:00
1238,Subhankar Chowdhury,IIT Kharagpur: ‘Tell the dean the warden has thrown us out’ - Telegraph India,"A video has emerged that purportedly shows an official of IIT Kharagpur, accompanied by several guards, telling students at a hostel to leave the campus immediately, failing which their belongings would be taken away.The students at the Madan Mohan Malviya Hall of Residence could be heard pleading for some more time, saying they could not return home because of lack of transport options in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.The dean of students’ affairs at the IIT, Somesh Kumar, denied that the authorities were trying to evict students from the hostel. Those in charge of Madan Mohan Malviya Hall, he said, were only trying to persuade the students to return home because three students have tested positive for Covid-19 on the campus since last Wednesday.The IIT authorities had on August 19 asked the 300-odd students still on the campus to move out by August 23 after a student had tested positive for Covid-19.In the video clip, students could be heard saying that they could not leave because of lack of transport options. “We cannot leave. You lock us in from outside. We cannot step out,” a student was heard telling the official, who was accompanied by a number of guards.At this point, the official told the students: “Aapko nikalna padega. Dekhiye abhi bahaut aadmi aayega, aap logo ka samaan le jayega (You have to leave. See, a group of men will now come and take away your belongings).”When the official sought to know when the students would leave the campus, they pleaded helplessness. “We don’t know when we will be able to leave…. Trains are not going to our home (states),” one of the students said. “How will we go?” another asked.The official then asked if 10,000 students of the institute could go home, why couldn’t the 300-odd? The students countered him by saying the institute had prevented them from leaving.The official then told the students: “Go to the dean and tell him that ‘the warden has thrown us out’.”Dean Kumar said it was no longer safe for the students to stay on the campus. “We are going to each hall of residence to make them understand. There is no question of forceful eviction. While the warden was speaking to the students, there could be some exchange of words,” he told The Telegraph.How can the students leave in the absence of transport? “There are several travel agencies on the campus. They should speak to them,” said Kumar.",2020-08-25 02:29:00
1239,Subhajoy Roy,CM Mamata Banerjee irked over construction materials on roads in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday expressed concern about construction materials lying dumped on the roadside and blocking drains, increasing chances of flooding during the monsoon.She told urban development and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim to ask all civic bodies to impose penalties on people caught dumping construction materials on or along roads. The chief minister raised the issue during an administrative review meeting of several districts that she attended from Nabanna via videoconference.Mamata narrated a personal experience while travelling to Behala, when she found that drains were blocked in Tollygunge, New Alipore and Behala.“People keep bricks, sand and other construction materials on roads. As a result the drains get blocked,” Mamata said. “Fine them. You have to be aggressive at times. Conduct a drive and find out who is not adhering to rules. Fine them and withhold their permission till they adhere to the rules,” Mamata told Hakim, who is also chairperson of the board of administrators of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).“Why should someone dump materials on the footpath and block the drains. Don’t they have a responsibility? No one is saying that they cannot build a house. But why will other people in the neighbourhood suffer? People have to understand this,” Mamata said.“I was going to Behala one day when it was raining. I found the drains blocked in the entire area from Tollygunge, New Alipore to Behala.”Metro has reported several times how footpaths lie encroached with construction materials, forcing people to walk down roads putting their lives at risk. Outside some buildings under construction, materials block the footpath as well as the road.Engineers and officials of the CMC admitted that dumping construction materials on footpaths or roads was common. “Anyone building a house is allowed to stack construction materials outside for three months from the day the building plan is approved. They have to pay a stacking fee to the CMC,” said an official.“The three-month time is given on the assumption that after that period the owner will be able to create enough space on the plot to keep the materials. But even during this three-month period, no one should stack a huge quantity of materials that can block a drain, footpath or a road,” the official said.Anyone who finds that a builder or plot owner has kept materials on a road for many months can lodge a complaint with the building department of the CMC. “We will issue a show-cause notice to the architect or the builder or the owner of the plot. If they still do not amend ways, we will issue a stop-work notice,” the official said.The chief minister also criticised the tendency of councillors to only think about the welfare of their respective wards and not a neighbouring ward. “Some councillors have a habit that they ensure pumps work in their areas and not in neighbouring wards. They want their wards to remain clean but do not bother about a neighbouring ward. This cannot happen. All people are ours,” Mamata said.Covid warriors from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s Borough III after their felicitation at the civic body’s solid waste management department in Narkeldanga on Tuesday.
Covid warriors are those who have been rendering their services during the lockdown.The borough’s outgoing chairperson, Anindya Routh, and other civic officials had organised the programme. The 110 people who were honoured included civic employees who sanitise an area or a building where someone has tested positive for Covid-19, municipal solid waste cleaners, drivers, doctors at civic clinics and some officials at Beleghata ID Hospital.“All these people work in the nine wards of the borough,” Routh said.

1240,Kinsuk Basu,"Coronavirus outbreak: In gloom, idol hub mirrors financial doom from Covid - Telegraph India","Tapan Rudra Pal is no longer in a hurry and finds time in the afternoons to sit for lunch.Till last year, with less than two months till the Puja, the artisan at Kumartuli would be forced to skip lunch. With rows of idols waiting to be readied and labourers moving around in a frenzy inside his studio, Pal could squeeze out just enough time for a cup of tea.This year it’s different.Puja is less than two months away and the idol-making hub in north Calcutta, which hums with action in the run-up to the festivity, is plunged into gloom. As orders for Durga idols have sharply declined compared with previous years, most studios are empty and the usual rush to meet deadlines is missing.Artisans believe the Covid-19 blow has landed them in the worst financial crisis in at least five decades.Kumartuli has so far received orders for Durga Puja idols worth less than Rs 15 crore, artisans said. Last year, it had received orders worth around Rs 50 crore. If the figures are correct, Kumartuli has garnered just 30 per cent of last year’s business.And last year wasn’t exactly great — several big pujas had to curtail their budgets as the economy was on a downward swing.“Last year was bad compared with previous ones. But nothing like this time. Organisers are not even turning up to book idols. The ones that are calling up are seeking idols for half the last year’s price,” said Babu Pal, the secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sankritik Samity.“The organisers that had last year bought idols in the price range of Rs 60,000 to  Rs 70,000 are unwilling to pay more than Rs 25,000 this year.”Every year, over half of Calcutta’s 4,500-odd community pujas buy idols from Kumartuli. The bulk of the bookings are done by July, latest by mid-August. Committee members would turn up in hordes and scan idols across studios before placing their orders.The goddess would usually be at least 12ft tall. “This year organisers are looking for idols that are 6-7ft high,” said Kaushik Ghosh, an artisan, who was busy packing a two-and-a-half foot idol, the shortest by any standard, to be sent to Sweden.Fewer orders and shorter idols mean lesser work for assistants and helpers at Kumartuli, the bulk of whom are from Nadia, Howrah, East Midnapore, and North and South 24-Parganas.“Kaaj i nei (There is no work),” said Uttam Pal, a seasoned hand among the assistants. “I have been hopping around studios from Kumartuli to Ultadanga to Tollygunge looking for work. Ei somoy (this time, referring to the run-up to the Puja), bhabtey paren (can you imagine)?”In his 50s, Pal is from Taherpur, near Chakdaha, in Nadia. His daughter is pursuing BCom and son is in Class X. Pal is part of the 3,200-odd army of assistants and helpers that plays a key role in giving shape to idols.“These workers would get paid between Rs 10,000 and Rs 30,000 a month this time of the year, depending on their skill sets,” said Akhil Kumar Ghonta, of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Karigar Samity.Only around 700 of these workers are now engaged in Kumartuli. Many like Pari-mal Ranjit of Canning and Saktori Pal of Burdwan are sitting at home, counting days for the pandemic to come to an end.“We are surviving on the little we could save over the years,” said Dipankar Pal, a helper from Chakdaha. “There is no hope round the corner.”Apart from assistants and helpers, a large number of labourers would turn up at Kumartuli around the time idols were to be taken to pandals. Most of them are residents of the Sunderbans, Canning, Baruipur, Joynagar and their adjacent areas in South 24-Parganas.Each group of labourers would take Rs 5,000 from each organiser to carry the idols from a studio to the pandal and place them on their perch. “They would turn up in groups of 25-30 each and around 100 such groups would arrive at Kumartuli just before the Puja,” said Mintu Pal, an artisan. “They would stay back and return home after immersion.”This time, around six or seven groups have said they would come despite the risk of the coronavirus. The rest are not sure about what to do.Each artisan in Kumartuli depends heavily on different sets of people for their supplies of straw, mud, bamboo, dress materials and ornaments. Suppliers bring the items from East and West Midnapore, Burdwan, and North and South 24-Parganas. Bamboo is mostly sourced from Murshidabad and Nadia.Last year, ornaments worth around Rs 3.75 crore were used to deck out the idols. A family of four usually works on different kinds of ornaments and dress materials. Around 400 families work on shola or pith ornaments.“A majority of them are without any order this year. The orders that have come add up to a little over Rs 1 crore. Imagine the slump!” Babu Pal, of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sankritik Samity, said.",2020-08-26 01:51:00
1241,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus outbreak: IIT Kharagpur students asked to sign undertaking - Telegraph India,"Students at IIT Kharagpur who are still on the campus had to sign an undertaking on Monday night that they would leave at the earliest, said a number of students.Many had to attach printouts of their air tickets with the undertakings to prove they were serious about leaving the campus, where three students have tested positive for Covid-19 over the past week.The undertaking was sought hours after a video emerged that purportedly showed an institute official, accompanied by guards, telling students at the Madan Mohan Malviya Hall of Residence to pack up and leave immediately, failing which their belongings would be taken away.The IIT authorities had on August 19 asked the 300-odd students still on the campus to move out by August 23 after a student had tested positive for Covid-19. These students said they could not leave for home earlier because of lack of transport in the middle of the pandemic.A student from a hill state said he had received a job offer in Bengal. “I felt it was unsafe to return to my hometown and then report for duty,” the student said. “We had wanted to leave when other IITs were vacating their hostels but were denied permission.”Another student said the authorities were “failing to realise that normal train services have not resumed yet”. Flights are irregular, too. Many of the students on the campus are from faraway states.“I had to give an undertaking to the warden that I would leave the hostel within two weeks and had to attach a copy of the flight ticket as a proof of my intention. Several others had to do so,” a student said.Another said the dean of students’ affairs, Somesh Kumar, was advising them to approach travel agents on the campus who were charging a premium.Many are worried that they would be quarantined for two to three weeks once they reach home. “We are not sure about the quarantine facility. These concerns would not have arisen had we been allowed to move out before the imposition of the lockdown,’’ he said.Dean Kumar said the students were expected to honour the undertaking. ’’We are asking them to leave for their safety,” he said.He denied that the travel agents were charging a pre-mium. “A few students may have genuine problems. But most stayed back because they wanted to use the Net connectivity on the campus. If most students could vacate the hostels by June 20, they should be able to leave as well,’’ he said.",2020-08-26 01:52:00

We are really worried and concerned,” she wrote in her letter on Tuesday.Referring to the Supreme Court’s verdict on approving the tests, Mamata said: “However I would like to request for your kind intervention and to consider the central government making an appeal to the honourable apex court to review its decision in the interest of the student community, so that they are free from mental agony and mental disaster.“I would request you to kindly appreciate the sensitivity of the matter and consider taking necessary action for postponing these examinations until the public health situation becomes conducive again.”The JEE-Main exams, through which students are admitted to engineering colleges, are to be held from September 1-6.The National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), through which students are admitted to medical colleges, is scheduled for September 13.The National Testing Agency on Tuesday told the Bengal government about its decision to go ahead with the exams, a state education department official said.The agency apprised the government of the safety measures it has taken to protect students from any potential health risk, the official said.Exams will be held across eight cities in Bengal.The agency, which conducts all-India entrance exams such as JEE-Main, JEE-Advanced and NEET, has said that each candidate will be given a three-layered mask before he/she enters the exam centre.Also, each candidate will have to wash their hands with soap and water or clean them with sanitiser before entering the centre. Distancing rules will be followed while making seating arrangements.“But the health risk stems from the fact that candidates will have to turn up at the centres to write the test and any assembly during the pandemic poses a grave health risk,” the official said. “In her second letter, the chief minister has reminded the Prime Minister about her concerns.”",2020-08-26 01:56:00

1245,"Fr. J. Felix Raj, SJ",Remembering Mother Teresa’s life and message on her 110th birth anniversary - Telegraph India,"August 26 2020 is Mother’s 110th Birth Anniversary.I am fortunate and blessed to share my birthday with her and with Archbishop Thomas D’Souza of Calcutta. Mother’s favourite words have always inspired me: “The fruit of silence is prayer; the fruit of prayer is faith; the fruit of faith is love; the fruit of love is service and the fruit of service is peace.”In August 1990, I planned an article on ‘Jesuit Influence on Mother Teresa’, and I dropped in to meet her not knowing that she was in Retreat. She did see me. While I apologised for disturbing her, she just smiled and said, “I will always have time for Jesuits.”When she heard that I was from St. Xavier’s, she conversed with enthusiasm and advised me, “Being a priest is not enough, being a good priest is important…. The Jesuit vocation is very special. You are called to a great and cosmic spirituality. You are called to aim at nothing less than St. Francis Xavier….” Mother was a woman who spoke with authority and gentle yet firm conviction.It is said, ‘every beginning has an end and every end has a new beginning’. Mother is not dead; such a life cannot have a conclusion. She bridged the gap between life and death like Jesus Christ and her legacy continues to live in the hearts of her sisters and followers like me.Mother Teresa had habitually preferred Jesuits as Retreat Preachers, spiritual directors and confessors for herself and her Sisters. Many Jesuits of Calcutta Province, including Cardinal Trevor L. Picachy and Fr. Camille Bouche, were in close contact with her.Fr. Celest Van Exem was the earliest main advisor and supporter to Mother Teresa and for the foundations of the Missionaries of Charity, since her days as Loreto Sister. He was the spiritual director to whom Mother Teresa confided her inspiration and who first sought to discern the authenticity of her experiences. He was the first to support Mother in requesting Archbishop Périer to begin the process for her to leave the Loreto Congregation. He made major contributions to the writing of the Constitutions of the Missionaries of Charity.A less known fact in her life is that as the Missionaries of Charity flourished and gradually gained the attention of the world at large, Teresa progressed from confessor to confessor the way some patients move through their psychoanalysts.Fr. Van Exem gave way to Archbishop Périer, who gave way in 1959 to Cardinal Lawrence Picachy, who was succeeded by Fr. Joseph Neuner in 1961.By the 1980s the chain included figures such as Bishop William Curlin of Charlotte, N.C. For these confessors, she developed a kind of shorthand of pain, referring almost casually to “my darkness” or spiritual dryness and to God as “the Absent One”. There was one respite. In October 1958, she rejoiced, because “the long darkness or absence of God.... That strange suffering of 10 years” disappeared. She was confirmed that God ordained her Society, the Missionaries of Charity.Fr. J. Felix Raj is the vice-chancellor of St Xavier’s University, Kolkata",2020-08-26 02:02:00
1246,Pratapaditya Mazumdar,Mother Teresa’s 110th birth anniversary - Telegraph India,"Mother Teresa used to say often: “Love one another as God loves each one of you.” On August 26, as the world celebrates Mother’s 110th birth anniversary, this is the message that we must carry in our hearts and live by.I first met Mother Teresa in 1985, when I was the commanding officer of the 1st Bengal Battalion of the National Cadet Corps at Jodhpur Park. From then till she breathed her last in 1997, I remained in touch with her.Service at the Missionaries of Charity is voluntary. Sisters from all over the world come forward to serve the great cause sacrificing personal comfort.My association with Mother allowed me a glimpse of how she bound the sisters in a well-knit family with the sole aim of serving humanity. “Families that pray together stay together,” Mother used to say.Mother was an embodiment of kindness but she knew when to be firm. I remember one occasion when I was accompanying Mother for an important work in Barrackpore. It was around 3.30pm and just as we were leaving Mother House, a sister came up to her and informed Mother that she had an appointment with a minister at 5pm the same day.Mother replied: “Please inform the minister that I am proceeding on an urgent work. If he could see me at 6.30pm.”The sister returned after some time and said: “But Mother, an appointment had been given to the very important minister.”Mother replied firmly: “I have told you, please convey that I can see him not before 6.30pm because of the very urgent mission of mine.”Mother Teresa was always sympathetic to the poor and took care to ensure they faced no difficulties under her care. Once while visiting a newly built section at Shanti Dan, the home for the destitute at Tangra, Mother spotted a broken door glass pane. She immediately instructed the sister-in-charge: “This broken glass can injure the inmates. Kindly get these removed and replaced urgently.”Mother Teresa was very practical and methodical in all her actions. It was this approach that helped her manage such a vast and spread-out organisation. My wife and I had made it a point to meet Mother Teresa on weekends regularly to seek her blessings and guidance.Mother had everything in abundance but she preferred to lead a simple life. She did not use a fan in her room, not even during summer. Mother once said: “You know, I was given thousands of saris in Singapore. How nice of them.”I asked her: “But Mother, you always wear old saris that have been mended all over with stitches.”Mother replied: “If I change my saris often, then I shall become rich.”Mother was forever down to earth. It did not matter whether she was in the company of kings and queens in palaces, or with the Presidents and Prime Ministers of the most powerful nations. She spent most of her time with slum-dwellers. She treated all the same way — greeting everyone, rich or poor, young or old, with her infectious smile and blessing one and all.It was not possible to fathom the extent to which she had touched the world with her kindness and benevolence. When she passed away on September 5, 1997, it seemed the whole world had congregated in Calcutta.Never ever have I seen such a gathering of delegates from all over the globe. They poured into Netaji Indoor Stadium to pay respects to Mother.Mother Teresa came to India and served the cause of the poor till her demise, inspiring millions to follow in her path.As we celebrate Mother Teresa’s birth anniversary, let us all remember her motto: “The fruit of silence is prayer. The fruit of prayer is faith. The fruit of faith is love. The fruit of love is service. The fruit of service is peace.”Let us all pray together that more Mother Teresas are born to continue her noble work that can bind the world as a common home.Pratapaditya Mazumdar is a retired army lieutenant colonel",2020-08-26 02:04:00
1247,Jhinuk Mazumdar,"Coronavirus lockdown: Online, nursery kids open up to school heads - Telegraph India","The online interaction for admission to nursery has become a more informal and comfortable experience for children as parents log in from their homes, heads of several schools said.Many parents are getting the opportunity to log in from other countries, cities or their offices in the same city, the heads said.Some of the heads who have been conducting such online interactions for two or three-year-olds have felt that children are “at ease” because they are in a familiar space and at times “more responsive” than they would be during an interaction on the school campus.In the principal’s office they are intimidated by the “foreign environment” but in their homes they are jumping on the bed, bringing their toys to show over the screen and running across the house with their mothers following them with phones, at least heads of two schools said from their experience of conducting the interaction online this year.In one school parents have “bribed the child” with a chocolate to make him sit and the interaction was conducted in between mouthfuls of chocolate.There have been instances of parents preparing themselves while in the waiting room, applying make-up and adjusting their hair and completely unaware that they have already been let in the meeting room.Calcutta International School, South Point, Indus Valley World School, South City International School are some of the schools conducting online interactions at present. Many more will start in September.“When we planned we didn’t realise what the interaction would be like; but it has been a heartwarming process so far. Children look more comfortable and at times more responsive than they are when they attend the interactions in school,” Dalbir Kaur Chadda, principal, South Point School, said.In one of the interactions at South Point, the grandparents joined and the school did not object to it. “They were curious to know how the interaction was being conducted and we did not object because they did not interfere,” Chadda said.Often, the big school gates, the waiting time or moving from one room to another can be intimidating for the child, a teacher said.“Our interactions have been informal always but the big difference is that the school is an unfamiliar environment for the child. The nature of the questions have not changed and we ask them to point out objects or pictures on the screen but the comfort level of the child is more because they are in a familiar terrain,” Amita Prasad, director of Indus Valley World School, said.To give the interaction more structure Calcutta International School communicate to parents beforehand a set of things that they have to keep with themselves before the start of the interactions. It includes stationery such as a set of crayons, drawing book and blocks.“These are aids used during the interaction. We observe the child’s behaviour, which gives us an insight into the family and how the family is dealing with their behaviour,” Farishta Dastur Mukerji, psychotherapist and counsellor at Calcutta International School, said.Online interaction gives children an edge as they are in their own territory, Mukerji said. “There is no separation anxiety for the child. For children as young as three or four they often end up crying when separated from their parents, all of which is now taken care of,” Mukerji said.The online interaction allows parents to join the interview from other countries, too.“We have had parents logging in for the interaction from abroad. For one child, the father was in Mumbai, the mother in London and the child is here with grandparents. Even doctors have attended the interaction before going for a surgery,” Chadda said.South City International School has been helping parents who are abroad. “We have scheduled interviews taking into account the time lag between countries because parents are abroad,” principal John Bagul said.This generation is hooked to devices and their responses are quick, Bagul said. “There is no hesitation while they interact.”In the past few months many children have been making video calls to other members of the family, which perhaps familiarised them with the new mode, a teacher said.“There are some who cannot perform to their actual ability because they are not exposed to the screen. The online interaction has been with known family members but for the school interaction they see new faces,” Mukerji said.",2020-08-26 02:13:00
1248,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Unlock 4: Schools to stay shut, flights to resume on September 1 - Telegraph India","Schools and colleges in Bengal will remain closed at least till September 20 because of the Covid-19 situation, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday.“Under these circumstances, I do not believe it will be prudent to lift the lockdown completely. As of now, we are announcing that the schools, colleges and universities will remain closed till September 20 as they already are. The status quo in terms of functioning will be maintained,’’ Mamata Banerjee said at a news conference in Nabanna.Earlier, the chief minister had expressed a wish that schools could open on alternate days from September 5, Teacher’s Day, if the situation improved.On Wednesday, Mamata requested the Centre for a third time in three days to put on hold the all-India engineering and medical entrance examinations until the situation became conducive again. “25.06 lakh students will write the tests (JEE-Main and NEET). They will be crammed in the centres to write the test…. Let the tests be held when the situation becomes conducive,” said Mamata.The JEE-Main exams, through which students are admitted to engineering colleges, are to be held from September 1 to 6. The National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), through which students are admitted to medical colleges, is scheduled for September 13.“The chief minister scrapped the plan to reopen schools from September 5 as the Covid situation has worsened,” an official in the higher education department said.Five-hundred-and-fifty-four Covid-19 cases were detected in Calcutta on Wednesday, according to the state health department. Nineteen people died from the disease in the past 24 hours. The number of active cases in the city stood at five.“Given the spike in cases, the chief minister announced on Tuesday that her government had launched a door-to-door survey to identify people with comorbidities. The death of over 87 per cent of Covid patients has been attributed to such health conditions,’’ the official said.“She is against conducting JEE-Main and NEET now as any kind of physical assembly at the exam centres could pave the way for the spread of the disease.”A professor at Jadavpur University, where only a handful of employees are attending office to run the essential operations, said the administrative headquarters of the institute, Aurobindo Bhavan, had to be closed twice as two employees tested positive for Covid. “If normal gathering is allowed, there could be a disaster,” he said.“In the absence of regular transport, how will students come to campuses?” asked a vice-chancellor.
The teachers, many of them elderly and suffering from comorbidities, are too scared to visit campuses. Non-teaching employees are reluctant, too.“How could there be classes without teachers? The state government is justified in extending the closure. Let the situation stabilise first,” said another VC.The condition is so bad that the state government has not been able to announce the start of the academic session even as colleges are about to publish the merit list for the first-year students.",2020-08-27 04:23:00
1249,Snehal Sengupta,Potholes on VIP Road and Jessore Road trigger traffic snarls - Telegraph India,"A series of potholes on VIP Road and Jessore Road near the airport is causing long traffic snarls during rush hours every day, even on days the city is under lockdown.Commuters headed towards the airport as well as Ultadanga, in the other direction, are facing a harrowing time around the airport as the asphalt surface has worn off on both flanks of VIP Road.To add to the woes of motorists and pedestrians alike, construction materials are stacked along VIP Road at various places, including in front of the airport’s gate number 1.Near the airport, a combination of craters, construction materials on the roadside and bottlenecks created by traffic guardrails are triggering traffic snarls during rush hours.Motorists headed towards Belghoria Expressway as well as cars driving into the city from the expressway are facing regular snarls because of potholes on Jessore Road. The problem gets compounded at night when trucks drive to the city from the expressway as well as places like Barasat.It takes as long as 30 minutes during non-rush hours to travel between the airport gate number 2.5 and the point where Belghoria Expressway meets Jessore Road.Adding to the problem, traffic guardrails placed in a zig-zag manner on VIP Road and Jessore Road narrow down the carriageway and increase the travel time.Traffic snarls are also being reported regularly from the EM Bypass-Broadway intersection, near the Sports Authority of India (SAI) complex, as a 200-m stretch of the road is pockmarked with potholes.
Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Monday raised the matter of battered roads in the city and neighbouring areas during an administrative review meeting, which she and other participants attended via videoconference.She said she had found the top coat of a road worn off on her way to Nabanna a few days ago. She also expressed concern about construction materials lying dumped along roads, blocking drains and increasing chances of flooding during the monsoon.Metro had on August 12 reported about the poor condition of some of Calcutta’s roads. Engineers of several state government agencies had blamed the poor condition on the absence of repairs ahead of the monsoon because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
A resident of Baguiati said her husband had faced a traffic snarl around 9pm two days back and had to take a detour to reach Dunlop.“My husband usually drives down Belghoria Expressway to reach Dunlop. However, there was such a traffic snarl near the airport that he took a U-turn and turned back to Teghoria. He then took Dum Dum Road and drove to Dunlop,” she said.Chandan Agarwal, a Sreebhumi resident, said snarls were a regular occurrence near the airport and it was taking half an hour to reach the airport’s gate number 2.5 from Baguiati, a distance of around 5km.
A senior officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate’s traffic wing said the width of the road near the airport gate number 1 crossing had reduced by some extent because of the ongoing construction of the Airport-New Garia Metro line.“We have a regular deployment of traffic personnel at all hours in an attempt to keep traffic moving. However, it is a very busy area as vehicular traffic from Nagerbazar, Dum Dum, Barasat as well as from the city converges here. We have asked the agency that maintains VIP Road and Jessore Road to undertake repairs,” said the officer.According to a plan drawn up by the commissionerate, one lane of the EM Bypass-bound flank of VIP Road is being cordoned by guardrails in the evening to make room for airport-bound vehicles. “This is being done to ensure faster dispersal during the evening rush period,” the officer said.Another resident of Dum Dum said every spell of rain washed away some of the soil from the Metro construction site near the airport, making the road surface slippery. “My bike skidded and I fell into a pothole while riding home in the rain. I was wearing a helmet and am fortunate to have escaped with minor injuries. The authorities must do something about it immediately,” said Sunil Biswas, a resident of Dum Dum Station Road.",2020-08-27 04:32:00
1250,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Teachers’ help sought to vacate IIT Kahragpur hostels - Telegraph India,"The IIT Kharagpur director has requested teachers to ask all students to vacate hostels and leave the campus by August 30 after 10 people in the institute, five of them students, tested positive for Covid-19.The rising numbers “is a serious concern”, director Viredra K. Tewari said on Wednesday evening.In a letter to teachers, he said: “You maybe aware that 10 people of our campus, out of which five are students, are Covid positive. This is a serious concern for all of us. Considering the safety and well-being of everyone, I appeal to the faculty to instruct their students who have been staying in the halls of residence to vacate them and leave the campus by August 30.“I request all to ensure that no student is on the campus and everyone leaves positively by August 30.”The director requested the teachers after visiting the halls of residence, registrar B.N. Singh said. “We have accommodated the students as long as possible. But now the scenario has changed.”The appeal from the director came two days after a video emerged showing an IIT Kharagpur official, accompanied by guards, telling students at a hostel to vacate the campus, failing which their belongings would be taken away.“Today, there was a perceptible change in tone. The director requested us to understand the gravity of the situation. We are not sure, though, how we will move out at a time when transport options are scarce,” a BTech student who hails from another state said.“On Monday, the warden of Madan Mohan Malaviya hall of residence came with guards to throw us out. Today, the director has asked teachers to speak to us,” an MTech student said.The IIT authorities had on August 19 asked the 300-odd students still on the campus to move out by August 23 after a student had tested positive for Covid-19.“On Sunday, two more tested positive. By Wednesday, the overall number rose to 10, prompting the director to request teachers,” an official said.",2020-08-27 04:45:00

The preferred mode is “distance digital”.An official said a central repository was being created on the university’s website, which would have a section where course materials and lectures would be uploaded.Once the content is uploaded, the addresses of the files — in Word or PDF format, audio notes or video recordings — will be shared with the students. “Teachers will share the addresses of the files with the students through email or any messaging service,” the official said.The university is also subscribing to online platforms for more space. “The lectures and study materials will be uploaded on YouTube. Students will be given links to view the content,” the official said.A teacher of the physics department said the advantage of this mechanism was that a student could go through the content at any time of the day. “Then, in consultation with the teacher, a slot will be fixed for clearing doubts through conference calls,” he said.Parthapratim Roy, a teacher of the physics department, said he had asked students to make conference calls for clearing doubts. “As making a conference call does not require Internet connectivity, those without a smartphone can be engaged, too,” said Roy.VC Das said: “Real-time online classes will not be held generally. We want classes to be held in distance digital mode. If a teacher wants to hold online classes on a paper that has 10 students, with each enjoying sound connectivity, he is free to do that.”The departments have been asked to adopt a digital mode in consultation with students, so that whatever platform is used for online dissemination of knowledge, no student is left out,Classes for the next semester will start on September 14.The university is raising funds to provide smartphones and high-speed Internet data packs to 800-odd studentswith poor connectivity at home. “We are raising a corpus on our own and with the help of willing individuals and business houses,” Das said.",2020-08-27 04:48:00
1252,Our Special Correspondent,Father Gaston Roberge dies at 85 - Telegraph India,"Father Gaston Roberge, considered the doyen of film studies in Calcutta, died on Wednesday. He was 85 and suffering from age-related-ailments.The Jesuit priest-turned-film academic from Montreal, Canada, reached Calcutta in 1961, and the city became his home.He founded Chitrabani, a centre for film studies, with the help of Satyajit Ray, in 1970 as an extension service of St Xavier’s College, Calcutta, and remained its director till 1996.He taught in the film studies department of St Xavier’s College. He was the founder-director of the UGC’s Audio Visual Research Centre, which later became Electronic Multi Media Research Centre under St Xavier’s College.Father Roberge lived on the college campus. “He had not been keeping well for the past few years… he was living at the infirmary for priests,” a member of the college’s former students’ association said.He had told this newspaper earlier that the first Indian film he saw was the Apu Trilogy in New York on the eve of his journey to India. “I was very impressed, particularly with Pather Panchali,” he had said.He had done his Masters in theatre arts (film) at the University of California in Los Angeles.“With the passing away of Father Gaston Roberge, the Jesuits lost a noble companion who served the Society of Jesus for 64 years and a guru of film theory, who was confident of India's potential in the area of film, art, culture and media,” Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College, said.He was associated with the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, Calcutta, National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, Jamia Milia Islamia University, New Delhi, and Calcutta and Jadavpur universities among other institutions.Father Roberge conducted several discourses in various countries on the films of Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen, with whom he had the best of academic exchanges.

1253,Sanjay Mandal,Six-city flight services thrice a week from September 1 - Telegraph India,"Flights between Calcutta and six cities in the country, suspended since July 6 as a precaution against Covid-19, are set to resume on September 1 but services will be available only three days a week.“I will tell the chief secretary and home secretary that flights from six places such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai can operate for three days. Then there will be some (relief) after September 1. But everyday operations should not happen,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday.In the evening, Bengal home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay wrote to civil aviation secretary P.S. Kahrola, saying flights could operate from Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad to Calcutta “thrice a week” from September 1.Airlines immediately complained that there was a difference between what the chief minister said and what the home secretary wrote.An official in the Bengal government clarified to Metro on Wednesday night that what the chief minister announced was the state government’s stand. “Calcutta will have flights ‘three days a week’ to these six cities and not ‘thrice a week’,” the official said.The state government’s letter to the civil aviation ministry reads: “This is also to inform you that restrictions on flights coming in from six cities viz Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai and Ahmedabad is being partially lifted from September 1, 2020 onwards. Flights from these cities can come to West Bengal thrice a week.”It also mentioned that the state would be under lockdown on September 7, 11 and 12 and the ministry should “ensure that there is no flight coming to or going out of West Bengal on those three days”.Airlines said there would be confusion on who would fly since the state government had not clarified on which days flights would operate and how many flights would be allowed each week.Before the ban, 25-odd flights would operate from these cities to Calcutta every day.“We are getting in touch with the Airports Authority of India headquarters to get clarity on the schedule. We hope there will be clarity in a day or two,” said an official of a private airline.  
A team in Delhi will allocate the slots after discussing with airlines, said an official at the Calcutta airport.Flights to Calcutta from the six cities were suspended on July 6, following a request from the Bengal government, because of a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases there.“The decision is welcome but it would be better if the ban was lifted completely. Also, we once again appeal to the state government to reconsider allowing international evacuation flights,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.",2020-08-27 04:53:00

Once we mentioned that, the driver said we should add the destination to our booking and that the fare would change, too. The moment he turned his face towards us and started talking, I realised he was intoxicated,” said the 19-year-old college student.The woman alleged that when she protested about his state of intoxication, the driver said the smell was that of a sanitiser. “Before I could react, he got hold of a can and sprayed something on my face. It blinded me for a few minutes and my eyes started watering. My friend and I started screaming for help,” she said.The driver then apparently lost control of the car and the vehicle rammed into a road-side railing. “Just when the car stopped, the driver again turned towards us and tried to touch my feet as if trying to apologise.

1255,Subhajoy Roy,Faster radiotherapy for cancer patients - Telegraph India,"A private hospital in Calcutta has introduced a new machine for radiotherapy treatment of cancer patients.More patients can avail themselves of the treatment in a day because the machine gives more targeted radiotherapy in a short time, doctors at the hospital said on Wednesday.The Halcyon E linear accelerator, which the Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals has started using, can provide radiotherapy treatment in two to three minutes compared to the 15-20 minutes taken by older linear accelerators.A patient goes inside a linear accelerator machine for radiation therapy, a doctor said.The Halcyon E is advanced in one more respect. The therapy is fully “image guided”, which means doctors will be able to see the exact location of the tissue where they intend to target the radiation.A tumour can move 1-2cm because of various reasons such as breathing if it is in the breast or of if the urinary bladder is full one day and empty on another day, a doctor said. “The image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) will enable thedoctor to see the exact location of the tumour when the therapy is being administered.”“The doctor can accordingly manipulate the direction of radiation and target the affected tumour, completely protecting neighbouring tissues,” said Tanweer Shahid, a radiation oncologist with Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.“In the older accelerators, we could give therapy to 60-70 people in a day. In the Halcyon E series machine, we can provide treatment to close to 100 people in a day,” Shahid said.The Apollo Gleneagles Hospital had two linear accelerators. After the introduction of the Halcyon E series, one of the older accelerators has been decommissioned, a doctor said.Prathap C. Reddy, the chairman of the Apollo Hospitals group, who attended the formal inauguration of the machine on Wednesday through videoconferencing from Chennai, said the hospital had made consistent progress in the field of cancer treatment.“We have consistently improved in cancer. Patients not only from India, but also from abroad visit our hospitals for treatment,” he said.An oncologist in the city said this was the first Halcyon machine being introduced in any hospital in Calcutta. If more hospitals procure the machine, it will benefit more patients, the oncologist said. “Patients have to endure a long wait to undergo radiotherapy. But a machine like Halcyon will reduce their wait.”",2020-08-27 04:58:00
1256,Debraj Mitra,"Unlock 4: Metro services can resume with social distancing, says CM - Telegraph India","Metro services can resume by maintaining social distancing norms, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday.Suburban trains can also resume in phases and railway officials can “talk to” the state government on resumption of both services, she said.But railway officials said they would wait for directions from the Centre before approaching the state government.“If Metro authorities want to resume services, by maintaining physical distancing norms… we don’t have any objection. Similarly, if local trains resume gradually… may be one-fourth to start with. If this is done, we don’t have a problem. The railways can talk to us on resumption of services,” Mamata said at Nabanna.Asked about the statement, Metro general manager Manoj Joshi said: “We will work out the modalities with the state government. But the ministry of home affairs has to allow resumption of Metro services first. The railway ministry will then take a call on specifications.”Metro services have been suspended since March 25 because of the Covid-19 curbs. On June 29, the home ministry had issued guidelines that listed Metro among activities that would not be permitted. The guidelines were issued hours after Mamata had said her government would talk to the railways for partial resumption of Metro for essential service providers.Railway sources said any direction on resumption of services from Delhi would come with a set of standard operating procedures, like the number of passengers allowed in each coach. The implementation of the SOPs will be challenging because most trains in the Metro fleet do not have cameras inside them. “For effective crowd control, the feed has to be accessed by the control room,” said an official.An eight-coach Metro train can seat around 400 people. The carrier used to ferry over 600,000 passengers a day before the lockdown. Maintaining social-distancing among even a third or fourth of that number would be daunting, officials said.Access for only smart-card users and ensuring crowd control right from the station gates are some of the steps being considered by Metro for resumption of services, sources said.Eastern Railway officials said they, too, were waiting for a nod from Delhi. “The chief minister spoke of the resumption of one-fourth of local trains. That might make crowd control more difficult because most local train passengers are office-goers or workers,” said an official.“Anything we do for crowd control and social distancing, we cannot do without the help of the state government,” said Sheelendra Pratap Singh, the divisional railway manager of Sealdah.",2020-08-27 05:00:00

1259,Mita Mukherjee And Jhinuk Mazumdar,Lockdown worry for CLAT aspirants - Telegraph India,"At least 10,000 students set to appear in the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) from Bengal have no clue if they will be allowed to go to an exam centre and take the test during a complete lockdown on September 7.They have been writing emails to the authorities conducting the examinations and the state government and also calling up local police stations for help since the government announced the fresh lockdown dates on Wednesday evening.CLAT will be held online this year but students have to take the test sitting at various centres. A St James’ School student said his first choice for a centre was Calcutta and the second Howrah. He is worried whether he will have to travel to Howrah in the middle of the pandemic.None of the students has yet been told where their centre will be.There are students who have recovered from Covid-19 and are worried about taking public transport and the gathering at their centres. “Nine members of our family had Covid and we are all negative now. But yes, my family and I are worried about exposing ourselves to a gathering,” said a student.Students set to appear for CLAT said the number of examinees was less than JEE-Main and NEET but it still exposed them to the same risks.Apart from Calcutta and Howrah, the exam will also be held in Barasat, Barrackpore, Hooghly, Asansol, Kalyani and Siliguri. Unlike other all-India entrance examinations, such as JEE and NEET, CLAT has fewer centres and students often have to travel long distances to reach their respective centres. While many students have their own transport, there are quite a few who depend on public transport.“If so many students have to go out on a lockdown day, the entire purpose of a lockdown is defeated,” said a student.Several students said they did not know whether the centres would be properly sanitised. “We will be sitting on desks, using the mouse. Even one cough in the exam centre could be a cause of fear and stress,” said Samya Amir.Samya’s first centre preference is Calcutta,  second Barrackpore and the third Barasat. The high prevalence of coronavirus cases in North 24-Parganas is also a cause of concern for students like Samya. “I am worried about my parents’ health and the risk I will be exposing them to. A home proctored test will be a safer option,” she said.St James’ student Shlok Saha, who lives in Ballygunge, said:  “My first preference for centre is Calcutta and the second is Howrah because that is the closest to my place. If I get a centre in Howrah, I will have to travel that far. We have been hearing about so many Covid cases there. My family is worried but CLAT is very important for me.”Devansh Murmuria, another student of St James’, said that since Wednesday evening he had called several people but there was no definite answer.“What if we are stopped on the road? Will the admit card suffice?” wondered Shashank Jain, from St Xavier’s Collegiate School.Another all-India entrance test, conducted by IIM-Indore for a five-year integrated management course, is scheduled for September 7. Students who will appear in the test and their guardians requested the state government to change the lockdown date.“Kindly change announced lockdown on 7th September, as there’s Pan India admission test for IIM Indore,” the father of a candidate tweeted and tagged the chief minister’s office.An official of IIM-Indore told Metro: “As of now there has been no change in the examination date.”",2020-08-28 03:18:00
1260,Sanjay Mandal,Schedule for 6-city flights to Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and three other cities to Calcutta will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays in the first two of weeks in September and Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays after that, civil aviation ministry officials have said.The dates have been fixed keeping in mind the three lockdown days chief minister Mamata Banerjee had announced on Wednesday — September 7 (Monday), 11 (Friday) and 12 (Saturday).“Between September 1 and 13, flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur to Calcutta will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. From September 14, they will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The airlines have been informed about the days,” an official in the civil aviation ministry said.The Centre had on July 6 suspended flights between the six cities and Calcutta, following a request from the Bengal government, because of a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases there.  The chief minister announced on Wednesday that the flights could operate three days a week from September 1. Soon after Mamata’s announcement, the state government wrote a letter to the civil aviation ministry, formally informing the Centre about the decision.Officials of private airlines said they would start filing applications for slots.The civil aviation minis-try guidelines allow 45 per cent of domestic flights on respective routes compared with the pre-Covid times. Initially, the ministry was allowing 33 per cent of the flights.Airlines had been operating 25-odd flights from the six cities to Calcutta daily since the resumption of domestic flights till the ban kicked in on July 6. “It was 33 per cent of the flights that used to operate on these routes before Covid-19 struck. Now, under therevised guidelines, more flights can operate but that would depend on the airlines,” said an official of the Calcutta airport.Tour operators said they had started getting queries from passengers. “Many Calcuttans are still stuck in places who are unable to come back because the flights were stalled. They can now come to Delhi or Mumbai on these days and take a connecting flight to Calcutta,” saidAnil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.The Centre has relaxed quarantine norms and a passenger taking an international evacuation flight to India need not go for quarantine at the entry point. The passen-ger has to test negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before the journey to become eligible to board an evacuation flight.",2020-08-28 03:20:00
1261,Subhankar Chowdhury,Funds cloud on Jadavpur University alumni noble goal - Telegraph India,"The Jadavpur University Alumni Association is usually flush with funds, thanks to its well-established alumni around the world. But it is now reeling under a financial crunch.So acute is the crisis that it is finding it difficult to pay salaries to the people it employs in its office on the university campus.Donations have dried up and an end to the problems is not in sight, according to several association members.They are unsure how they can keep supporting the poor but meritorious students.The earnings by letting out the association’s auditorium and guest rooms on the university campus have stopped as the campus has been closed since March.  Hiren Ghosh, the president of the alumni association, shared with JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das the scale of support the association has been providing to students amid the pandemic.“The financial status of the alumni association is not at all favourable now,” he said in a letter to Das. All donations from the usage of auditorium and guest rooms have stopped since March 2020 because of the closure. Foreign donations for students’ funds and other causes have stopped, he said. “We have been somehow paying wages to our 10 employees… till July. Do not know how long we can continue. But these are issues for the alumni association to handle. This is for your information only.”Ghosh had graduated in mechanical engineering in 1961.The main earnings come from generous contributions of the alumni based in the US and the UK and in other parts of the globe, he said.“While renewing the membership they make generous contributions. At times some make hefty endowments. All these contributions are converted into fixed deposits and we pay scholarships to hundreds of students from the interest on the FDs. But we are not receiving that support from March,” Ghosh said.Also, interest rates on fixed deposits have been dwindling, another office bearer said. So, the association looks forward to a sustained support to continue with its activities. “The interest rate on a fixed deposit was 9.5 per cent three years ago. Now, it is 5.5 per cent. On the other hand, the list of recipients is shooting up. So, we try to keep the coffer slush with funds… that has gone dry.”The association, which has 4,000-odd members, has informed the vice-chancellor that it has helped 338 needy students; Rs 10, 37,800 was distributed to them. The money was transferred to their accounts last week.Additionally, more than Rs 10 lakh was distributed to an equal number of students in February.The association told Das about the figures to let him know that this support ensured the students could buy smartphones or high-speed data packs, which helped them attend classes through distance digital mode.Das had on August 16 wrote to the association, seeking its support for 800-odd students encountering Net connectivity problems.“We could provide substantial support based on the donations we had received till February. We don’t know how we can sustain the move in future. The members are reluctant to donate as everyone is facing financial troubles,” Ghosh said.The association runs the Dr Triguna Sen auditorium on the ground floor of its building and lets it out for any kind of programme other than political.The upper floors have five double bed AC guest rooms, which can be hired. “But earnings have stopped because of the pandemic. We are struggling to pay the monthly wages to the employees of the association,” a member said.",2020-08-28 03:22:00
1262,Pinak Ghosh,Anti-fraud card curbs and headache  - Telegraph India,"Rising instances of fraudulent online transactions have prompted banks to disable many debit and credit cards by default. Customers have to go through a “tedious” process of reactivating the cards through Net or mobile banking, or through relationship managers with an option to deactivate them when they are not needed.Bank officials said customers could use deactivated cards to make payments at retail outlets or withdraw cash from ATMs. But a customer has to get such a card reactivated if he or she wants to use it to make an online payment.Banks — public and private — are disabling cards to prevent fraudulent online transactions or contactless payment. Once a card is disabled, alerts are sent through SMS and email to the account holder.According to Reserve Bank of India’s January 15 circular, cards that have not been used for online or international transactions will be mandatorily disabled. In other cases, banks will take a decision based on risk perception of cardholders.Bank officials and financial technology experts concede that the process to get a card reactivated is tedious but they say allowing customers the freedom to switch on and off their debit or credit card is crucial, and the best option available globally, to prevent fraud.RBI data shows the number of reported fraud cases for card and Internet-based transactions has increased from 1,866 in 2018-19 to 2,678 in 2019-20. The amount involved has risen from Rs 71 crore to Rs 195 crore.The first quarter of the current fiscal (April to June), much of which coincided with the nationwide lockdown, saw a rise in the dependence on online transactions. The number of reported fraud cases stood at 530 during the period, involving Rs 27 crore.“The decision (to deactivate cards) is based on an RBI directive in January. Banks are gradually rolling this out…. What we have seen in many European countries is that transactions are not OTP-based and payments can be made by simply swiping the card or in a contact-less manner through Near Field Communications technology. Even if there is a two-factor authentication, it is not difficult for fraudsters to secure OTP through skimming and cloning or simply misleading the customer,” said a State Bank of India official.“If a fraud is committed in India, it is easy for banks and RBI to track it and take action. But, if the card is used overseas without the knowledge of the cardholder, it becomes difficult to track. So the RBI’s move to allow a manual toggle for online and international transactions is a preventive measure,” said an HDFC Bank official.“On the face of it, this seems to be an inconvenience to customers but, through this, they are in complete control of the security of their cards. RBI nowhere has said that the liability is now on the customer to manage the fraud. They are only bringing this as an additional security feature. The process will be made easier going forward with technology,” said Rajesh Mirjankar, MD and CEO, Infrasoft Technologies, a Mumbai-headquartered firm that has partnered with banks to offer application-based solutions for this purpose.Several banks such as SBI, Axis, ICICI and HDFC have rolled out this option to easily toggle between activating and deactivating a card. More banks are set to follow.“The idea is to be omnichannel when it comes to security. In the next phase chatbots and voicebots (such as Alexa)-based solutions are being rolled out. Artificial intelligence will also be used in future to validate digital transactions based on past mandates of the customer,” said Mirjankar.",2020-08-28 03:26:00
1263,Subhajoy Roy,Prescription not needed for test at CMC camp - Telegraph India,"One can now walk into a camp organised by the civic body and give swab samples for an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 without a doctor’s prescription, officials said on Thursday.So far, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has been organising such camps to collect swab samples from those who were identified as possible coronavirus-infected persons during a surveillance by health workers of the civic body or others mobilised by the local ward coordinator. And those turning up to get tested needed to show a doctor’s prescription.The RT-PCR test is the most reliable method to find out whether a person has been infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes Covid-19. The samples collected in the camps are sent to SSKM Hospital for testing.CMC officials said a decline in the turnout at the camps had prompted them to do away with the condition that one needed to show a doctor’s prescription.“So many people would come to the camps from May to July that resources would be overstretched to collect their swab samples. But the turnout this month is quite low,” said a CMC official.To ensure a better turnout, the CMC is updating its Facebook page every night with information about the wards where such camps will be held the next day. “We have been publishing this information on our Facebook page for the last couple of days. We want more people to know whether swab samples will be collected near their home the next day,” said Sandipan Saha, advisor (information technology), CMC.Saha, who is also coordinator of Ward 52, said that only 30 people gave their samples at a camp in his ward on Wednesday. “The team was prepared to collect many more samples. We had made announcements about the camp, yet the turnout was low,” he said.“Laboratories are conducting the RT-PCR test if someone has a doctor’s prescription. But someone who has failed to consult a doctor but has symptoms of the disease can come to any of our camps and give swab samples for a test,” said a CMC official.The camps are conducted in six wards of the Calcutta municipal area every day. The CMC Facebook page is only naming the wards where the camps will be held and not the venue because locations are often changed at the last minute, Saha said.“Those who want to be tested should contact the ward coordinator or the ward health clinic of the CMC to know the venue,” he said.CMC officials said they were aiming to collect swab samples from about 500 people for the RT-PCR tests daily.The CMC is also conducting rapid antigen tests — another type of diagnostic test for Covid-19 — in highrises and other locations. “We have a target of doing about 1,600 tests, RT-PCR and antigen, every day,” said a CMC doctor.",2020-08-28 03:30:00
1264,Our Special Correspondent,House collapse kills 70-year-old in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A portion of an old house on Beleghata Main Road collapsed early on Thursday while it was raining heavily, killing a 70-year-old woman and injuring her son.Around 4.30am, the front portion of the house’s roof that is supported by iron beams and mounted on old pillars came crashing down, police said.Pratima Saha and her son Rajesh were trapped in the debris. Some residents of the area alerted Beleghata police station and a team of cops and Disaster Management Group personnel reached and rescued the two.They were taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital where Saha was declared dead. Rajesh, who had received severe injuries on the head and arms, was admitted to the orthopaedic ward.“The house is nearly 150 years old. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has served several notices to the family asking them to pull down the structure,” a civic official said. “Even a board declaring the house to be a dangerous building had been put up.”Rajesh lived in the house with his mother, wife and son. His wife had recently gone to her father’s place. His son was asleep in a room at the rear side of the house when the front portion collapsed.“The family members will be asked to vacate the house as soon as they can because we are not sure about the structural stability of the remaining part,” an officer said.Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators, called up senior officials of the civic body early in the morning and instructed them to help the police in removing the debris.",2020-08-28 03:36:00
1265,Our Special Correspondent,"Kolkata weather: 24 hours late, it pours and floods - Telegraph India","It rained heavily on Thursday, more than 24 hours after it was supposed to according to the weather office, leading to several roads being waterlogged.Strong southerly winds from the Bay and the monsoon trough passing over Digha led to the formation of many small shells that brought the rain, a Met official said.Citing the formation of a low-pressure area over the Bay, the Met office had predicted heavy rain in the city from Monday. The latest forecast on Tuesday evening warned of heavy rain in the city after midnight by when the system was expected to pass over Calcutta’s outskirts. But a drizzle or two was all the city received throughout Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.The system deviated from the path it was supposed to take and took a northwesterly direction, past Odisha and adjoining regions, leading to heavy rain in those areas, the Met official said.“It was too far from Calcutta to have an impact. On Thursday afternoon, the system was in south Jharkhand. The rain that came down on South and North 24-Parganas, Calcutta, Howrah and Hooghly from Wednesday night was triggered by the formation of local clouds because of strong southerly winds,” G.K. Das, the director of IMD, Calcutta, said.The monsoon trough, which was passing over Digha, contributed to the cloud formation, he said.The weather in Calcutta is set to improve from Friday, Das said.It was hot and dry for the better part of Wednesday, like the previous two days. A light drizzle started in the night. As the night progressed, the rain became stronger. In phases, the showers lasted well into the early hours of Thursday. After a gap in the morning, the city saw intermittent showers in the afternoon.The Met office recorded around 50mm of rain in Alipore between Tuesday night and Thursday afternoon.Santoshpur Jora bridge was among the wettest areas, registering 74mm of rain between 4pm on Wednesday and 4pm on Thursday, according to data collected from the civic body’s pumping station. Patuli and New Market received 70mm each, Cossipore 50mm and Dum Dum 48mm in the same period, the civic body’s data showed.The soft targets in the city were not spared.Around 11am on Thursday, several stretches of Amherst Street, Thanthania and Muktaram Babu Street in the north had ankle-deep water. In the south, some areas in Kidderpore and Tangra were waterlogged.But there were no traffic snarls as it was a complete lockdown on Thursday.“The showers coincided with high tide in the Hooghly. The lock gates were shut and the water flooded some low-lying areas. But portable pumps were used and the water was cleared within a few hours,” Tarak Singh, a member of the CMC’s board of administrators in charge of drainage, said.",2020-08-28 03:38:00

1268,The Telegraph,"With students locked down at home due to the pandemic, the August 15 celebration went the same way as their classes — online - Telegraph India","August 15 has always seen the grandest celebrations at Sri Aurobindo Institute of Education as it marks the birth anniversary of Sri Aurobindo, is the school’s foundation day and of course, is also India’s Independence Day. And students weren’t about to let the pandemic change that. They released a slew of videos of their performances on YouTube starting with the principal’s address on August 15. “We never imagined the school in complete silence, without any children playing in the field, without assembly or classes. Covid-19 has shattered our lives but has not been able to stop students from expressing themselves,” said principal Debleena Bhatatcharya.Teachers and students, she said, had used technology this year to reach out and their performances too spoke of solidarity.
 So a Hindi play depicted a typical home in the lockdown scenario, where the parents are now working from home and kids are itching to go out. But ultimately they realise they are better off being able to spend time together and learning new skills. United, they now look forward to freedom from Covid. The play was shot at homes of different students and edited to look like the same. An audio drama showed a girl getting irritated when her grandparents repeatedly ask for help to use their smart phones and remote controls. “She also looks down on an uncle who limps, only to be reminded that he had lost his legs in a war,” said Sagnik Banik, a Class X student who wrote the script. The protagonist is taught at the end to see the sacrifice of her grandparents and not to discriminate between age and ability. There were dances too. Dance teacher Susmita Nandi Sethia choreographed dances for the tots by sending them videos of herself doing the moves. “Then I had to send another video teaching parents how to upload the kids’ videos to Google Drive. Even then, there were challenges of poor resolution and it was difficult to correct the movements over video call.” Her students danced to songs like Aao bachho tumhe dikhaye. Nandi Sethia would later be part of a dance collage by teachers too. “I have been a part of this school for the last 15 years and never has a function passed without me dancing on stage,” said head girl Anushka Bose. “So this year too, I have shot my dance video at home and sent.” Most of the videos were edited by Jyotirmoy Sanyal of Class XII. “This is our last year of school and we’re spending it on online classes without living it up with friends,” lamented the boy who took part in some plays. “Even if different, this year’s celebration shall be memorable,” said head boy Saptarshi Dutta, who handled much of the show’s co-ordination.Brinda SarkarSalt Lake School uploaded two videos on its social media sites to mark Independence Day. One was created by the students of Class VII and the other by those of Class XII. Performing to editing, it was an all-student show all the way. “Most classes have unit tests going on. Usually exams are over by now but this year classes started late. The Class VII batch was very enthusiastic to do something for August 15, so we asked them to go ahead,” said principal Sugata D’Souza. The Class VII video had 13 students taking part to give lip to the Roja song Bharat hum ko jaan se pyara. “There were 12 of us initially. So we divided the song amongst ourselves and recorded  giving lip to the section given to us. The clips were sent to me and my father helped me put it together. He is used to editing cooking videos for my mother’s YouTube channel,” said Ishita Samanta, one of the participating students.This meant Drittriksha Chakraborty had to give lip to the male voice of Hariharan. But she did her best to make up for the incongruity with her expressions.The number became 13 when another student, Aryabrata Samaddar, wanted to join. “We had run out of lines in the song, so we added a bit of Main rahoon ya na rahoon to accommodate him,” said Ishita, who loved the experience of being part of the video. “If we were going to school in normal times, there would be no guarantee that our class would have been chosen to perform in the I-Day show. It was because we discussed doing something and our friend Arka Mitra took the request to our class teacher that we got to do this.” The video created by Class XI was a haunting collage of able performances, captured in black and white. The suggestion to do away with colour came from English teacher and cultural co-ordinator Payel Das. “I wanted the video to have a pre-independence feel,” she explained.The Class XI students were asked on Monday if they could produce something in time for I-Day on Saturday. Pratiti Majumder and her namesake Prateeti Parida were put in charge of editing the video. They were also among the five participants. While Pratiti recited Amitabha Dasgupta’s hard-hitting poem Amar naam Bharatbarsha, Prateeti sang Ebar tor mora gangey.Asked about the challenges they faced, Pratiti said receiving a clip of Vande Mataram shot vertically from Srijata Pramanik had caused them a headache. “We had forgotten to ask her to shoot horizontally. Prateeti too had not noticed the problem when she converted the colour clip to black and white. Later she suggested changing the ratio of the picture. The video editing software took care of the rest,” Pratiti smiled.Then it became a race against time. Sagnik Sikdar’s flute piece, which was to conclude the video with the national anthem, finally landed at 10pm on August 13. Both videos were uploaded on Saturday. “We will do a more elaborate Teachers’ Day programme,” D’Souza promised.Sudeshna BanerjeeThe 33-minute video prepared by Hariyana Vidya Mandir on Independence Day started with photographs of the school officials hoisting the national flag on campus. There was not a single student present. But some of them did their bit at home, in advance, by recording performances. 
“The students are missing school but at least they should stay involved. So we have taken the entire co-curricular calendar online. This was perhaps the seventh occasion they contributed from home for since April after Janmastami, Gurupurnima, Rabindra Jayanti, Rakhi, Premchand Jayanti and World Yoga Day,” said principal Sanghamitra Banerjee.The programme started with a spiritual discussion on staying healthy and stress-free amid the pandemic. “Start the morning with thanksgiving to the Creator, your body and mind, nature and your family. Take a resolution to be strong, to be at peace and to be fearless. Do not waste energy in arguments and by being irritable. Banish the thought of what would happen if you or your loved ones fall ill,” said B.K. Shivani, spiritual adviser, Brahma Kumaris, in a recorded address.Class X students Titas Ray, Ditisa Mondal and Anusha Bhattacharjee got the show rolling with the Dwijendralal Ray song Dhanadhanyo pushpo bhora, dressed in white sari with red border, on their respective rooftops. Shreyan Dey recited Kalidas Ray’s poem Annapurna. But Class XII student Sankalp Singh’s recitation was an in-house special as the poem in tribute to Kshudiram Bose was composed by the school’s Hindi teacher Sangeeta Agarwal. “August 11 was the martyr’s death anniversary. I wanted to make the students remember him on this occasion,” said the lady, who has been teaching at the school for 23 years. “I gave an offer to the students, sending them a few lines to recite as test. Sankalp was chosen from those who submitted recordings,” she added. Sankalp’s elder sister Akanksha prepared the video clip with the recitation, with visual material sourced from the Net.Soumyajit Chakraborty of Class IX played a piece on the guitar, Bipasha Dey, Aditi Singh and Godhulika Dasgupta danced, Snehaparna Saha recited while Anushka Chakraborty and Archisman Dutta presented solo songs. Another highlight was Debasmita Bisay performing karate moves with Nanna munna rahi hoon playing in the background. The girl studying in Class VII, who is just a step away from black belt, would have preferred attending school on the day but felt she would have been nervous if asked to perform on stage. “At home, space was a problem but I had the option to record again. The one submitted was my third take,” she said, adding that her kicks were not high enough due to lack of practice.   The last segment of the video, edited by the co-curricular activity co-ordinators of the school’s two shifts — Satarupa Hore and Sanjukta Sengupta — comprised dance pieces by Mouma Pal, Disha Gupta and Asmita Mandal, with the latter performing to the lesser-known fourth verse of Janaganamana Adhinayaka. The last shot was of the three doing a salute with Sare jahan se achchha playing in the background.Sudeshna BanerjeeWhen Rohan Khanna, head boy of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, said that it “feels strange to celebrate Independence Day away from school”, he was echoing the sentiments of pretty much everyone from the school watching him speak on the school’s YouTube page on August 15.“I missed the unfurling of the national flag and us singing our national anthem together. But even though we are not together, nothing can stop us from honouring the most important day in our national calendar,” the head boy continued in his address. With students and teachers away from the campus, the school took the celebration online by creating and posting a video to mark Independence Day on its YouTube page.The 45-minute video had both primary and secondary section students singing, dancing, reciting and playing different instruments from home.
All the participating students did their best to do up their background with suitable tricolour motifs. Flag in hand, Diptangshu Bhattacharya stood against orange and white balloons on the wall as he sang Chol re chol shobe Bharat-santan with five others from the primary section. Shirshannita Majumdar had balloons arranged in a triangle behind her. Aendri Basu wore tricolour wrist bands. Each student sang a part of the song and in the end all their voices were played together to give a choric effect. “This virtual celebration was a new experience for me as was practising at home.Our teachers helped us a lot. They would regularly do online practice with us and we also had the chance to record again if something went wrong,” said Aendri, a Class V student. “I wanted to have a virtual background and edited my recording but I was not happy with the result. So I sang and recorded again in front of the flag,” she added. The primary section also staged a dance to the song Vande mataram, with the four dancers sitting in poses of worship of different religions at one point and thereby delivering a message of communal harmony. “Our teachers had asked us to create a similar Tricolour-themed background, so I took three of my mother’s saris to hang. My father helped set them up. It looked colourful and bright. The most difficult part was all of us dancers having to wear the sari in a similar way, with one leg sticking out of the folds. In school, our teachers would assist us to get dressed but here we had to do it on our own,” said Ayushi Ray of Class V.A special part of the programme was an instrumental section where senior section students Soumyajit Pal, Souradeep De and Paulasta Ghosh played musical instruments like the violin, the keyboard and the flute respectively. But it was Souryadeepta Majumdar’s playing Ae mere watan ke logon on the melodica that caught the eye. “I chose to play an unusual instrument. It’s a very old model of the melodica that we had at home andI’ve been playing it for six years,” said the Class XII boy, who also can play the keyboard. The video carried another student’s name during his performance but he chose to play down the glitch, which was later rectified.  Drawings of several students were showcased during the instrumental performances. The senior section students also presented a medley of patriotic songs and dance. While some of the eight dancers recorded their part indoors others used their rooftop, lending some variety to the ambience. “It was difficult to make the students practise through recorded videos and online calls but we tried our best. I had divided the song lines among the participants and sent them the steps on only those lines as it was not necessary to make them dance to the complete song as it would be edited,” said Dipanwita  Dutta, dance co-ordinator.“We did not want to miss this occasion. The students sent us video clips of their performances which we edited and created a complete video. Everything was done beforehand except the flag-hoisting held on our school premises. That footage was added to the video at the end,” said cultural co-ordinator Mohua Kundu. Arun Dasgupta, the vice-principal, pointed out how tough it was to create a choric effect in the song, using individual recordings of singers. 
Sneha Das of Class XII not only participated in the secondary section’s dance performance to the song Bharat anokha raag hai, but she also edited the group’s dance video. “I like video editing and happily agreed when our teachers asked if I could edit our performance. Getting to perform was exciting and that too, in these times when we are locked down at home.” Head girl Siddhi Agarwal tried to be positive in her speech, referring to India’s scientific efforts in the space programme and the coronavirus vaccine race. She also referred to capability to think freely and freedom of opinion being prerequisites of a successful democracy. Head teacher Ranu Biswas reminded everyone that India was “passing through a period of crisis” and this was “not the time to quarrel over petty issues. We must stay strong and united…and bond irrespective of religion, caste and creed,” she said.Principal Sujata Ghosh put up a mirror to the state of the nation.  “The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in India has unveiled the actual condition of a large section of our countrymen. Poverty, oppression, illiteracy, hunger, a health system that is unreachable for many, inexplicable misery of lakhs of migrant labourers.... Is this condition desirable in a country 73 years after its independence?” She urged students to work harder as “you have a lot more to do for the country”. “A lucrative job and a life of luxury cannot be your only aim,” she summed up.Shatadipa Bhattacharyasaltlake@abpmail.com",2020-08-29 00:08:00
1269,Brinda Sarkar,Wedding amid a pandemic - Telegraph India,"Arnab Kumar Bhattacharya had always dreamt of welcoming guests to his wedding with the auspicious haldi, chandan and rose. Alas, his guests at AA Block community hall were welcomed with hand sanitiser. Priyanka Chakraborty of AB Block, New Town, had planned a big, fat Indian wedding spanning seven days. “I was to have many foreign nationals coming in and would have shown them every Indian ritual in the book,” she says wistfully. Alas, her social marriage was skipped and the registration had 25 guests with the foreigners watched the proceedings on Zoom!Namrata Roy Poddar had to shift her wedding out of BA Block community hall and into her own home. The groom sat on the terrace, adorned in topor and mask, while she sat in her study that had been transformed into a wedding hall by decorators.Welcome to wedding season 2020, where no more than 50 guests are allowed, where the priest chants mantras from behind a mask and where dinner is served in packets to be relished after a guest reaches home.While most weddings slotted this season are getting postponed, a few bravehearts-cum-romantics are taking the plunge anyway. Some are doing it as they have unwell relatives who want to see the wedding solomnised, others because there’s no telling how long they would have to wait for the pandemic to end. But in the bargain, they are facing and tackling unprecedented hurdles.  Priyanka had wanted to buy her wedding sari directly from weavers in Benaras but since that didn’t happen, she wore her mother’s wedding sari. When Namrata got married, in mid June, shops had barely opened. “I booked a Benarasi sari online but also bought one from CA Market, just in case the former didn’t land up. Lata Poddar, who runs a boutique in BA Block, supplied saris for the tatwo and did my make-up. But what really drove me up the wall was getting the blouses stitched,” she recalls.With no reputable tailoring shop open, Namrata had to resort to a footpath tailor in GC Block to alter her wedding blouse. “As for the blouses for gaaye holud and aiburo bhat, I myself had to thread a needle and do the needful the night before the wedding,” says the the NIFT alumni, who works as a merchandiser.In fact, when no invitation card shops could be found open, Namrata painted herself and her groom and took 25 printouts to invite guests.  Designer Namitha R. Dalmia, who runs Ssidhh Studio in Kankurgachhi, has created outfits for five or six weddings this season. “Some are negotiating the price, citing the poor economy or claiming that only 50 people would witness the wedding but I’m reasoning that since every other department has got trimmed down, the families have more to spend on the lehengas,” says the AJ Block resident. The outfits come with matching masks.  “Many are placing orders now for winter weddings.”Previously Namitha’s clients would celebrate sangeets, mehendis, pool parties, Sufi nights, poker nights and casino nights in the run-up to the big day but now she’s only designing for the basics — mehendi and wedding. When Arnab got hitched on July 2, he had to give the police in writing that there would be no more than 25 attendees, including himself and his bride. “A day before the wedding, the government extended the limit to 50 guests so I had to rush to invite 25 more people,” he recalls.At the venue, they erected a barricade in front of themselves, forcing a distance between themselves and guests. To avoid awkward situations among friends, some couples are inviting only family. “Eighteen guests were invited to my engagement, all of whom were immediate family. My fiance and I have a large group of friends whom we couldn’t invite but my cousins set up a Zoom link for them to watch,” said Anant Banka, who got engaged to Rashi Agarwal at an open ground in New Town, hoping it would allow better air circulation.Arnab’s bride Rituparna’s family had booked the hall for their July wedding by standing in queue from 3am on January 1. “That’s how coveted that hall near Dum Dum cantonment is and we didn’t have the heart to cancel this the venue. The reception took place at AA Block community hall after thorough sensitisation,” he says.  While Priyanka and Sombit Chowdhury settled for a registry, they performed a Narayan puja at her New Town home beforehand. “It was there that we realised social distancing was impossible at home, even with 25 guests,” says the lawyer, who then chose Ibis hotel. “We book the 150-capacity hall for 25 people.”Sumanta Maity, general manager of Golden Tulip hotel, says they have hosted over 10 weddings this season. “Previously our priority would be good food and quick service but now it’s safety! While most weddings have been postponed, some are spreading their festivities over several days so as to break the guest list up somewhat and invite as many as possible,” he says. Ritu Agarwal, who runs a wedding planning company called Ritvan Events, said she had organised three weddings between June and August.“Most people are opting for hotels as hotels are following all norms. The workers setting up the stage, lights and sound are working in different shifts and that too not more than four workers are allowed in the venue at a time,” she says.Given the challenges of commuting, couples are trying to wrap out proceedings early. “The logno of our wedding was at 8.35pm so we couldn’t help it but the reception was held in the afternoon. It was an unusual hour but back then, a curfew would come into force at 9pm. How would guests get home after that?” says Namrata.Priyanka too had to wrap up early as the next day had been declared a state lockdown. “We stayed the night at my New Town house and left for my in-law’s place in the morning. Since my husband is a doctor his car has a doctor’s sticker and the police did not stop us,” she says.But nothing beats a wedding party that came to Baisakhi Abasan from Chhattisgarh in early June. In fact, they caused ample consternation among residents when they launched themselves into the proceedings without the 14-day quarantine that was supposed to have been followed after inter-state travel.Another wedding at Baisakhi took place on the first day of the weekly state lockdown — on July 29. “The estate officer cancelled permission to use the community hall and we had to seek the MLA’s intervention to hold the wedding,” said Sukhendu Khamaru, secretary, Baisakhi Abasan Samity.Numerous theories have surfaced as to the safest way to treat guests to dinner this season.Arnab had a sit-and-eat as the caterer said a buffet would have people piling on top of one another for helpings. Namrata had the pulao-mangsho-chingri malai curry packed into boxes and handed out for guests to eat in the safety of their own homes. Asparagus Hospitality, an event management group, prefers buffet as it does it not require waiters to go up close to guests and serve. “And we are serving only five diners at a time,” says Pritam Dutta of the CA Block firm. In fact, they are going a step ahead and allotting separate time slots for friends and relatives to prevent crowding.  And even though the guest list may be miniscule, they are packing dinner for relatives who did not come. “In case no one showed up from a particularly family, we are delivering food home so the average number of heads we cook for is 70,” says Pritam.Dasgupta Caterers of Chinar Park has stopped cooking at the wedding venue and only delivers now. “Because of this, starters like kebabs have disappeared from the menu. Kebabs need to be served hot but without a live counter that’s not possible,” says manager Narayan Kundu. “Besides, catering for 40 people is not cost effective for us so we aren’t too eager to cater to weddings now.”Swade o Ahare, that has kitchens in AE Block and Sector V, has delivered food for a handful of weddings this season. “Most are at homes and we are not staying back to serve unless expressly requested,” says Subhrajit Boral, who runs the unit. “In case some guest gets Covid later, no one will blame their own family members. Fingers will point at us outsiders and we don’t want to take the chance.”When Studio Manorama got an offer to shoot a wedding in July, they jumped at the offer. “Safety and precautions we would manage later. But during such a lean period we need to embrace whatever business comes our way,” says Dwaipayan Chakraborty of the CF Block studio. In the pre-Covid era they would have got 15 to 20 contracts in this period.While they usually sent six to seven still and video photographers to weddings, they have trimmed it down to three now. “It’s working out fine as the number of guests, rituals, and of course, budget have all got slashed,” Chakraborty says.Indrajit Bhattacharya, partner at a photography agency called Wedding Bells, would even use drones to capture moments back in the day. “But now weddings are a subdued, compulsory celebration. All that jazz and bling are gone,” he says. At a wedding they covered recently, Indrajit says almost everyone began the day wearing a mask but let their guard down as the day progressed. “And for photos, everyone would take off their masks to show off their happy faces for the record,” says the CL Block resident.  Social distancing has also sent for a toss the customary group photo of guests with the couple on the stage. “People from the same family were eager to be clicked together but there was a lack of trust, and rightly so, when it comes to clicking with people living in different houses or from different families. The shooting experience was odd,” Indrajit says.Incidentally, the couple his company clicked stays in Hyderabad. They reached Calcutta a fortnight ahead of the wedding and stayed in quarantine to avoid any mishap.Priest Nilratan Mukhopadhyay, who has officiated weddings in both Salt Lake and New Town this season, says he has been sanitising flowers, plates and pidis before offering the couple. “And if they cannot make out the mantras through my mask I’m removing it,” says the priest who is being ferried to the venue on his son’s bike. The son is helping out with rituals in the absence of his assistants.Marriage registrars are in a fix. “The legal procedure requires us registrars to be photographed along with the couple. If the bride, groom and registrar stand apart as per social distancing norms how are they to fit in one photo frame? How are they to fit in the small offices that many registrars work out of?” asks Susmita Chakraborty of BF Block. “And of course, masks have to be removed for the pictures, making it all the more unsafe.”Banasree Chatterjee, general secretary of the Progressive Marriage Officer’s Association, proposes that this photo requirement be removed till the pandemic lasts. Chatterjee, whose jurisdiction includes Salt Lake and New Town, says 50-60 weddings on her calendar this season have been put on hold. “There is online provision now for certain steps of the registration but the site is down half the time,” says Chatterjee. “Couples have been trying to register online during the pandemic, failing to do so and blaming us for it!” Despite the hiccups, a BC Block youth is rather envious of those getting married now. “Think of how much money they are saving,” he laughs. Too bad he doesn’t have a lady in mind to take his vows now. Priyanka says the pandemic has meant zero interference from pesky neighbours. Her husband Sombit says they were spared from visiting unending relatives post wedding and were instead able to set up a mini bar at home in the time they saved. “Everyone should get married in the lockdown,” he laughs. With foreign destinations out of the fray, the couple took off for Diamond Harbour for their honeymoon and almost had the near-empty resort to themselves. “We went to Mandarmoni again on August 15 but it so crowded we stayed indoors,” says Sombit. “Either way, I’m glad I lived up to my promise to Priyanka: ‘lockdown or no lockdown, dilwale dulhaniye le jayenge!’”Additional reporting by Showli Chakraborty",2020-08-29 00:52:00
1270,Subhankar Chowdhury,Mamata Banerjee announced that Bengal would not have college and university examinations in September - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday announced that Bengal would not have college and university examinations in September.While delivering a virtual address, Mamata asked education minister Partha Chatterjee, who was seated next to her, to inform students by next week how they could be evaluated before Puja. The chief minister’s comment came hours after the Supreme Court upheld the University Grants Commission’s decision to assess students through offline or online exams or a blend of the two.About 7.5 lakh final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students in Bengal will have to take their exams because of the UGC’s directive on July 6, which has set September 30 as the deadline for the tests.At least six universities in Bengal had distributed results to their students in July based on internal assessments and results of previous semesters.An official of the education department said the assessment was done based on a UGC directive in April that left it to the respective state governments to decide on the mode of assessment.In her address on the occasion of the foundation day of her party’s students’ wing, Mamata said: “I can tell you this much that examinations will not be held in September. That question does not  arise. If the examinations are to be held, I will urge the education minister to look into the possibility of holding the exams before Puja, through online or offline mode, so that the students are not inconvenienced.”The UGC notification on July 6 said the examinations would have to be held by September 30.Mamata said: “I will urge minister Chatterjee to explore whether those enjoying the facilities can write the test online from home and those without the facilities can write the test offline from a place close to his or her home without requiring to travel far. Just do what is bare minimum. We need not go for the maximum. You consult with the colleges and the universities and follow the rules and inform the students about what you have decided by next week.”The chief minister took a dig at the Centre for not holding a formal exam to evaluate the graduating batches at the IITs. “Have you held examinations at the IITs? Examinations have not been held there. So the IITs are the best of institutions. We respect them. So at some of the institutions exams are not being held. At some institutions exams are being held,” said Mamata.IIT Kharagpur had assessed students in the spring (end) semester on the basis of grades of mid-semester exams, assignments, class tests and viva voce and cancelled the end semester exams because of Covid-19. The results were announced in early July.The chief minister suggested that her government could invoke the Disaster Management Act to hold the exams after September 30, a provision that was mentioned in the apex court’s judgment.“In the guidelines that have been given today about UGC, it has been stated that the examinations can be held later following the Disaster Management Act. The state government can decide on that. So we could hold the tests after 15 days or after 30 days. But apparently we have to hold the examinations,” she said.An official of the higher education department said the chief minister, while suggesting that her government could invoke the Disaster Management Act, was referring to what the court had said on the final page of the judgment. “The order says that if any state or Union Territory in exercise of the jurisdiction of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, has taken a decision that it is not possible to conduct the final year/terminal exams by September 30, they are at liberty to make an application to the UGC for extending the deadline for them,” the official said. “The appeal shall be considered by UGC and rescheduled dates be communicated at the earliest.”",2020-08-29 02:03:00
1271,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Modern High alumna stresses women’s success in Covid fight - Telegraph India,"Modern High School alumna Anita Bhatia, the UN Women deputy executive director, stressed the need for women leaders in decision-making roles, influencing policy and changing lives while speaking from New York with students of her school.“The problems that the world faces today, the existential threats of climate change, the erosion of democracy, the erosion of liberal values, and the erosion of secularism require a new kind of leadership. Is it any surprise that the countries that have done the best job in dealing with this pandemic are countries run by women — Germany, New Zealand, Finland, Taiwan among others,” she said while speaking to the students early this week.Bhatia is the assistant secretary-general for resource management, sustainability and partnerships and the deputy executive director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of women (UN Women).The girl from the Class of 1979 said: “We need more female leaders. We need women at the table, making decisions, influencing policy and changing lives. And I am so proud to be part of the family of Modern High School because every day Modern High School produces leaders who are capable of doing just that.”Bhatia has been working with women globally, addressing gender rights and issues of discrimination.The school recognised her as the “distinguished alumna” of 2020 during a webinar attended by present and past students and teachers joining from various time zones.Bhatia said the world has “turned upside down” during the pandemic and “women are at the centre of this crisis” but still underrepresented in leadership roles.“The frontline health workers during the pandemic are women, 72 per cent of the nurses in the world are women and still women continue to be underrepresented in all aspects of leadership,” she said. “Less than 10 per cent of the heads of state in the world are women, less than 10 per cent of the heads of government are women... and women continue to face discrimination in pay.”Head girl Mayukhi Ghosh introduced Bhatia as one who was not only academically brilliant and keenly interested in public speaking, debating and dramatics but also remembered by batchmates as “fun-loving and vivacious” with varied interests.“While many of us maybe very privileged and never face any sexism or discrimination we know that actually women can suffer a great deal when they are not given equal opportunity and most importantly when they are not given an education,” Bhatia said.In the midst of the pandemic Modern High kept its annual tradition of felicitating distinguished alumni in their chosen fields.“It is generally accepted that it is what students do after they leave the safe haven of the school that establishes the value of the institution where they were nurtured. On their part, the students say it was their school, which had shaped and inspired them,” director Devi Kar said.Bhatia does not miss a chance to visit her father in Calcutta and even in her schedule finds time to grow herbs in her garden, cook and visit the opera.“What I love about Modern High School and what I think is so important about an all girls and single gender education is that girls in all girls’ schools leave with models of strong female leadership,” she said.It is not for nothing that principal Damayanti Mukherjee said that this felicitation by the alma mater would remain “tucked into a very special, warm corner of your heart”.“You have made a choice to make a difference to the world, to communities and issues beyond your immediate and familiar. And therefore you are a role model to our gender and for Modernites — past, present and future,” Mukherjee said.The school authorities said they had received requests from people across the world to have online programmes. “We had people joining from various parts of the world… it generated a feeling of togetherness, which was unlimiting,” Kar said.",2020-08-29 02:10:00
1272,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus outbreak: Cops to help transport patients to safe house - Telegraph India,"The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation will ask police to accompany health workers and ambulances to transport “unwilling” Covid patients from slums to a government safe house for isolation.The decision to take the help of cops was taken after civic workers faced a steady resistance from Covid patients living in slums in Duttabad, Mongalganthi and in parts of Baguiati and Rajarhat, a Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation health official said. All these places are densely populated and those living here have little or no option to go for self-isolation as their single or two-room houses do not have toilets. They use public toilets and community taps for water.The living areas are cramped. A single entry to slums in these areas lead to narrow passageways lined with rooms on either side, a civic official said. It is impossible for a Covid patient to self-isolate himself/herself without risking the spread of infection among others, the civic official said.Earlier this week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had expressed her concern regarding the Covid situation in North 24-Parganas, especially because of the congested pockets in several places.Duttabad, a slum bordering Salt Lake; Mongalganthi and Atghara near Baguiati; and several areas in Rajarhat and Narayanpur are among the places under civic scanner.It was a challenge to transport patients from these areas to a safe house as they feel they are better off at their homes, a civic health department official said.“Many are refusing to move to the government safe house… they pose a serious risk to the spread of Covid. No amount of persuasion has worked… so, we decided to take the help of cops,” the official said.Civic officials are coordinating with officers of the Bidhannagar commissionerate, mayor Krishna Chakraborty said. “We will take the support of the police whenever necessary.”A safe house near Sector V is operational to help Covid patients from these areas to self-isolate themselves. But there have been several instances when health teams could not find patients at their homes or faced resistance from families when they went there to pick up such patients.“I have had to play cat and mouse with residents of my ward. There have been more than a dozen instances of Covid positive people refusing to go to the safe house,” Nirmal Dutta, the councillor of Ward 38, said.Duttabad is part of the ward. Dutta himself has tested positive for the coronavirus and is in isolation.Another civic official said there had been a couple of instances of men resuming work and stepping out of their houses even after knowing they had tested positive for the coronavirus.",2020-08-29 02:19:00
1273,Our Special Correspondent,Petrol on stove for not squealing - Telegraph India,"A taxi driver poured petrol on a stove at a roadside tea stall on Narkeldanga Main Road early on Friday over a dispute, leaving the tea stall owner with severe burns, police said.The driver, Sujit Yadav, 33, was arrested later in the day from his home in Duttabad on the charge of attempt to murder.The tea stall owner, Vinod Yadav, has been admitted to SSKM Hospital’s burn ward.Preliminary investigation has suggested the taxi driver was angry with the tea stall owner for failing to share with him the addresses of two of his clients who apparently picked a fight with the driver at the tea stall, the police said.The two were later identified as Saheb Yadav and Arjun Yadav. All three were at the stall to have tea around 5am when they got into a fight over shares from a profit they had made, an officer of Phoolbagan police station said.“The two fled the spot after the fight. The driver got to know they and the tea stall owner were from the same village. He wanted to confront the two and he kept asking the owner for their addresses,” the officer said.When Vinod Yadav failed to give him their addresses, the driver lost his cool and fetched a can of petrol from his taxi, which he had parked nearby, the officer said.Before anyone could react, he apparently emptied the can on the stove, on which Vinod Yadav was preparing tea for customers, the police have found after speaking to people who were present at the stall at that time.“As soon as he poured the petrol, a huge flame leapt up and burned the tea stall owner’s hands, chest and shoulders. He was admitted to the burn ward of SSKM. The taxi driver fled the spot,” the officer said.Cops will question the taxi driver to find the exact cause of dispute between him and the other two, another officer said.“It could be that they are party to some other offence and hence the dispute over the share of money. We will question Saheb Yadav and Arjun Yadav, too, in connection with the case,” the officer said.Four men were arrested on Thursday in connection with an illegal deal involving a rare species of lizard.Two men had taken money for the delivery of the lizard but failed to do so, police said. The buyer and one of his associates kept the two locked in a house to recover the money.Cops got to know of the matter after both parties filed complaints with Lake police station, the police said. ",2020-08-29 02:26:00
1274,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Refund order to four Kolkata hospitals - Telegraph India,"The state clinical establishment regulatory commission has asked four hospitals to return various sums that it feels the hospitals had wrongfully taken from Covid-19 patients, the chairperson of the panel said on Friday. The commission as an interim measure asked R Flemming Hospital in Topsia to return Rs 1.45 lakh of the Rs 3.45 lakh it had taken from a patient, said retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the commission. BP Poddar Hospital in New Alipore has been asked to return over Rs 60,000 to a patient, while Medica Superspecialty Hospital in Mukundapur and ILS Hospital in Dum Dum have been asked to return Rs 27,000 and Rs 15,000, respectively. Unlike the order for the Topsia hospital, the ones for the other three are not interim. “The patient who was admitted to R Flemming Hospital complained that he underwent dialysis twice during his six-day stay there. No other procedures were done. They complained that the Rs 3.45-lakh bill was not justified,” said Banerjee. “We examined the bill and asked the hospital to return Rs 1.45 lakh immediately…. If the hospital is able to justify the bill, it will get back the money. If we find other lapses… we will ask the hospital to refund more money to the patient.” Repeated calls to the phone number mentioned on the hospital’s website throughout Friday evening elicited the same response — that it was busy. About the order to BP Poddar Hospital, Banerjee said the patient had stayed there for four days and was billed Rs 1.51 lakh. “After analysing the bill, we directed the hospital to keep Rs 90,000 and return the rest to the patient,” he said. The Telegraph reached out to the hospital for a comment but no one responded till late on Friday.The complaint against Medica was about Rs 27,000 it had charged a patient for “consumables”. The insurance company whose policy the patient had bought refused to pay the amount. Alok Roy, the chairman of Medica, said the patient was not overcharged. “There are certain items that no insurance policy covers, but that does not mean we overcharged the patient. We were perfectly within the legal frame to charge this money. However, we agreed to refund the money with due respect to the proposal from the chair,” said Roy. The complaint against ILS Hospital was that it had overcharged a patient Rs 15,000 for PPE. “The hospital agreed to return Rs 15,000. They said the complaint was from a period when PPE rates were not capped,” said Banerjee. An ILS official, when contacted by this newspaper, promised to call back but did not do so till late on Friday.",2020-08-29 02:41:00
1275,Subhankar Chowdhury,"Options for state, post-Supreme Court entrance examination order - Telegraph India","The education department may explore the option of holding exams in common service centres, set up by the state JEE board to enable engineering aspirants to attend counselling, for the final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students, sources in the department said.The Supreme Court’s order on Friday upholding the UGC’s July 6 directive on conducting exams for the final-year batches has forced the department to consider ways to evaluate the students. The apex court set aside the pleas of several states, including Bengal, that students be assessed based on the results of previous semesters and internal assessment amid the pandemic.“Using the 17,000-odd common service centres, which the state JEE board has created across the state for students without Internet connectivity at home to upload documents and take part in online counselling, might be an option for writing tests online,” said an official of the department.“It will not be prudent for students to travel to colleges and universities to write pen-and-paper tests in October, given that Covid-19 cases are likely to rise before Puja. We are wondering whether these centres can double as venues where the final-year college and university students can write tests online.” The state panchayat and rural development department runs Sahaj Tathya Mitra Kendra across the state to promote e-governance among rural people. “These facilities, too, have Internet connectivity. They, too, can be thought of as venues for writing exams that would be bare minimum in nature, as the chief minister has suggested,” said a vice-chancellor.But one VC warned that a vast section of the students are not conversant with writing any online test and they need to be trained if these facilities are to be hired as venues for writing the tests.“The state JEE board had uploaded manuals in Bengali to guide engineering aspirants on how to take part in the process for several days. A similar kind of exhaustive training has to be started for college and university students at the earliest,” said a VC. Education minister Partha Chatterjee is likely to hold a meeting with the VCs soon to decide on the possible options.A principal said if the situation marginally improved by the first week of October, the option of holding pen-and-paper tests at colleges could be considered. Another principal said the state government should file a review petition as it has done in the case of NEET and JEE-Main.“The state government has become a party to a review petition the Punjab government has filed in the apex court, seeking deferment of JEE Main and NEET. The government should ask if the IITs can publish results without holding the exams, why not the state universities?” he said.",2020-08-29 02:49:00
1276,Jayanta Basu,Report nails goods carrier role in pollution - Telegraph India,"Goods vehicles are responsible for the bulk of automobile pollution in Calcutta and Howrah and the proportionate share is more in Howrah, a study by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) reveals. Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha had on August 18 handed the report — PM10 & PM2.5 Source Apportionment and Development of Emission Inventory of Twin Cities of Kolkata and Howrah — to the National Green Tribunal in connection with a petition filed by environmentalist Subhas Datta on air pollution.NEERI had carried out the study from April 2017 to December 2019, following an assignment from the state pollution control board.The report said that goods carriers were responsible for 49 per cent of the PM10 in the ambient air generated by vehicular emission. For PM2.5, the contribution of goods vehicles was estimated at 49.5 per cent. In Howrah, goods vehicles accounted for 67 per cent of both PM10 and PM2.5 in the ambient air generated by automobile emission.PM10 and PM2.5 are fine and ultra-fine particles that are major air pollutants in Calcutta and Howrah. Both types of particles can penetrate the respiratory system — the reach of PM2.5 is more because they are smaller than PM10 — and trigger a range of serious respiratory ailments, including cancer.In comparison, buses were found to account for 24 per cent of the total load of PM10 and PM2.5 emitted by automobiles in Calcutta. The corresponding figure for Howrah was about 13 per cent. The study found the contribution of private vehicles, both petrol and diesel variants, marginal.In Calcutta’s overall pollution mix, all types of vehicles together spewed 22 per cent of PM10 and PM2.5 in ambient air in summer. In winter, the figure stood at 25 per cent for PM2.5. In Howrah, vehicles were found to be responsible for 31 per cent of PM2.5 during both summer and winter. “The report underlines the importance of immediately undertaking strong actions against polluting and old goods vehicles in both Calcutta and Howrah,” said petitioner Dutta, who stressed the need to bring the environment-friendly Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to Calcutta at the earliest and replace petrol and diesel with it.“The results of the study are on expected lines as most goods vehicles run on diesel and they are generally ill-maintained. Most of them hardly undertake the mandatory pollution check,” said emission expert S.M. Ghosh.",2020-08-29 03:06:00
1277,Our Special Correspondent,"Coronavirus outbreak: Relief for non-insurance patients, says Panel - Telegraph India","The state health regulatory commission on Friday clarified that its advisory to private hospitals on offering discounts on the maximum retail price of medicines and consumables would only be applicable to Covid-19 patients without any medical insurance policy.The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission had earlier fixed at least 10 per cent discount on medicines and 20 per cent on consumables for Covid-19 patients who would buy those from the hospital’s pharmacy. After a meeting with representatives of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI), retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the commission, said the advisory on the discount would not be applicable to patients with personal or corporate medical insurance. “They (private hospitals) raised issues about the 10 per cent discount on medicines and 20 per cent on consumables, because they have issues about corporate and insurance patients. We clarified that for corporate and insurance clients this advisory will not be applicable,” Banerjee said on Friday. “For some medicines they said discounts are not available (from pharmaceutical companies). We told them to inform us about these on a case-to-case basis and we will speak to the manufacturers.” Later, officials of some private hospitals and insurance companies said patients with insurance policies were given a 5-10 per cent discount on their bills during discharge.“We have tie-ups with hospitals by which 5-10 per cent discounts are given on the final bill of a patient admitted with cashless facility. The non-admissible amount is calculated separately,” said an official of an insurance company. The CEO of a private hospital said such discounts were allowed as part of the agreement. Last Saturday, the commission had asked private hospitals to offer Covid-19 patients discounts on the MRP of medicines and consumables to lessen the bill burden. If hospitals are unable to offer a discount, they should allow a patient’s family to buy medicines and consumables from outside. At Friday’s meeting, private hospitals pleaded for withdrawal of the advisory that bed charges be capped at the rates prevailing on March 1. “We had said the bed rates of March 1 will prevail. They said the financial year in a corporate hospital starts on April 1 and they revised the bed charges that day. So they are finding it difficult to return to the earlier bed charges…. We told them that the March 1 date was fixed keeping in mind the non-Covid period charges and requested them to wait for some time till we get out of this pandemic situation. After that we will definitely reconsider this,” said Banerjee.Sources said the hospitals had been asked to charge the old rates till December. “We had a fruitful meeting on Friday. Since this was the first meeting between the AHEI and the commission, we presented our concerns before him (the chairman) and he gave us a patient hearing. He clarified that the discount is only for cash patients,” said Rupak Barua, president, AHEI and Group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.“In regard to bed charges, he urged us to continue with it (the March 1 rates) till December 31, after which the commission will reconsider.”",2020-08-29 03:20:00
1278,A Staff Reporter,Duttabad councillor tests positive for Covid-19 - Telegraph India,"Nirmal Dutta, councillor of Ward 38, comprising a portion of Duttabad, has tested positive for Covid-19. This makes him the second councillor under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation to be infected. Subhas Bose, councillor of Ward 6 that comprises places like Chinar Park and Kaikhali, succumbed to it. 
Dutta was down with fever since August 23 and the doctor advised him a Covid test. “I took the test on August 25 and my report has come positive. I am staying in home isolation now,” he said.Duttabad is reeling under Covid cases and Dutta himself admitted that many were not following proper social distancing and hygiene protocol in his ward. “More than 80 cases have been reported from Duttabad,” he said. “I have been organising testing camps and was also helping people reach government-run quarantine centres and safe houses.”",2020-08-29 04:03:00
1279,Sudeshna Banerjee,Covid safe house nod for Greenwood Sonata - Telegraph India,"Greenwood Sonata became the first housing complex in Bengal to receive government permission for initiation of a safe house for asymptomatic or mild Covid cases. The order, dated August 19, has been issued by the chief medical officer of health, North 24-Parganas.In the cover story titled ‘New Town complex sets up Covid centre’, The Telegraph (Salt Lake) had reported on July 24 that the housing complex had received satisfactory comments verbally from the government team that came for inspection. Sudipta Mukherjee, president of Greenwood Sonata Apartment Owners’ Association, said they had further done up the five-bedded facility. “We purchased semi Fowler beds with bedside tables, foldable mattreses, medicine trolley and stethoscope as well as created space for caregivers to stay.”While two residential doctors had volunteered to oversee neighbours who might be checking in with Covid-19, three more have since volunteered help if needed. Having in-house medical help is a key condition for setting up safe houses in residential complexes, according to the standard operating procedure issued by the central government for residents’ welfare associations to run Covid safe houses. “We are receiving queries from other housing complexes like Uttara Tritiya on how to set up a safe house,” said Mukherjee.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-08-29 04:11:00
1280,Debraj Mitra,Covid: WFH snips demand for formalwear - Telegraph India,"Crisp shirts stacked up on shelves. A neatly pleated trouser has a sole taker — the mannequin near the entrance.Sale of formal clothes has nose-dived at apparel stores across the city. Retailers attributed the plunge to “work from home (WFH)” — the new normal in the wake of the pandemic.Occasionally, for a virtual appraisal or a client pitch, the odd white shirt makes it out of the cupboard. It is paired with shorts, which passes off unnoticed on a screen.Sumit Khemani, who works at a south Calcutta store of a menswear brand, has been calling up people who were regular patrons before the pandemic to inform them of new arrivals.The stock response he gets: “What is the use? I am not stepping out for work. Let me know if there are new shorts and tees.”Kunal Kapasi, of another premium menswear brand’s Shakespeare Sarani store, used to sell “over 300 formal shirts” a month on average earlier. Since April, he has been selling “much less than 100”.Trouser sales have gone down sharply, Kapasi said. Usually, three to four shirts sell for every trouser, retailers said.Apparel brands, like most other segments, are trying to jump the safety-first wagon to tide the Covid crisis, said marketers.Many brands have started promoting “anti-bacterial” and “anti-viral” shirts. “This shirt kills 99 per cent of the Covid-19 virus,” reads a pamphlet at a store near Camac Street.“Inhibits virus and bacteria growth,” reads another poster on the glass wall of a premium apparel store at a Lake Gardens mall.“The pandemic has made everybody insecure. The brands are trying to capitalise on this insecurity. An added layer of perceived safety is the USP of a host of products — from switchboards to mattress covers. Apparel is no different,” said an advertising professional in Bangalore, who has handled the campaigns of leading lifestyle retail chains. The formal womenswear corner at an international retailer’s store in a city mall had one person on Saturday afternoon — a sales executive brushing a series of striped blazers. “A weekend two months before Puja there used to be a mad rush. But there is hardly anyone now,” he said.Womenswear has been the major driver of growth in the formal clothing segment for the past several years, in keeping with the growing role of women in the workplace, said advertisers and officials of apparel companies. The pandemic has put brakes on this as well. Officials of leading apparel brands said the plunge in sales was not without reason. “I work for a formalwear brand. I have not worn a formal shirt more than once or twice in the past four months,” said a senior official of a leading Indian fashion brand.The “anti-bacterial range”, he said, was targeted at people who still had to step out — bankers, sales professionals and so on.“Apparel companies are now concentrating on homewear — shorts, t-shirts. That is the only segment that has been getting some traction. Buttoned waistlines in trousers are being replaced by elastic waistlines and joggers,” he said.",2020-08-30 01:43:00
1281,Subhankar Chowdhury,MAKAUT extends fee deadline due to Covid impact  - Telegraph India,"Students selected for professional courses of the state technology university are struggling to pay their semester and admission fees, even in instalments, because of financial difficulties during the pandemic, a university official said on Saturday.So, the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology has extended the deadline for payment of the first instalment till September 4, the official said.All private engineering and management colleges in the state are affiliated to the university.Till last year a student had to pay Rs 32,000 in full for the BBA or the BCA course during admission. This year, students had to pay Rs 15,000 as the first instalment by August 26.Last year, an MBA student had to pay Rs 35,000 in full during admission. This year, it was Rs 15,000 as the first instalment by August 26.“This shows the financial constraints the students and their families are grappling with,” the official said.“Considering the pandemic situation and the requests from different quarters, the university is pleased to announce that the admission process through CET-I (Common Entrance Test) & JEMAT-I (Management Aptitude Test) is being extended for another 10 more days,” according to a notice signed by the university’s registrar Partha Pratim Lahiri.“The candidates informed the colleges about the financial constraints they have been facing in paying the first instalment. After the colleges requested us, we decided to extend the deadline,” Lahiri told Metro.The remaining amount for every course has to be paid by October 15.Many students have told colleges that earning members in their families have had their salaries slashed during the lockdown. Some have said their family members don’t have jobs anymore.The Telegraph had on August 20 reported that an estimated 1.89 crore salaried people lost their jobs between April and July in the country. July had recorded huge job losses after a partial recovery in June.The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd has estimated that close to 1.77 crore salaried people lost their jobs in April immediately after the lockdown. Another 100,000 lost theirs in May. The impact has been so severe that students are struggling to pay even in instalments, another university official said. “If they don’t clear the payments in time, colleges will struggle to pay their teachers. If this crisis continues we wonder if students would be able to pay the rest on time.”The National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, will let students pay tuition fees in instalments in the coming semester.A meeting of the NIT’s deans’ council has decided that 60 per cent of the tuition fees of Rs 62,500 has to be paid by September 30 and the rest by December 15.",2020-08-30 02:17:00
1282,Sanjay Mandal,Covid: brothers in arms fight stigma - Telegraph India,"Some people in Calcutta and neighbouring areas are trying to fight, literally on the streets, the stigma attached to Covid by preventing attempts to barricade a patient’s house.They are taking pulse oximeters to an infected person to check the oxygen level in his/her blood and organising street plays to make people aware of the misconceptions regarding Covid.Earlier this week, a convention was arranged at Ashoknagar in North 24-Parganas where representatives of political parties, voluntary organisations, local clubs, and many doctors were present.They discussed how to allay the fear of Covid among people. A group comprising young people of the neighbourhood has been formed. They provide Covid patients with pulse oximeters to check if the level of oxygen in their blood is satisfactory.“Several months after the outbreak of the pandemic, there is still an illogical panic and misconception in many people’s minds… often that leads to ostracisation of Covid patients and their relatives. But there are many others who have been coming forward to help such patients and their families,” Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health expert, said.Chowdhury is the mentor of Covid Care Network, an organisation of doctors, government officials and people who have recovered from Covid.“We are trying to bring such people under one umbrella. The battle is not only against the disease but also against this social problem. To fight the battle, people’s participation is required and government alone cannot do this,” Chowdhury said.He and members of Covid Care Network have been conducting meetings and conventions in Calcutta and neighbouring areas with a high prevalence of the coronavirus.At Ashoknagar, a group of volunteers, mostly members of local clubs, have been motorcycling with pulse oximeters to Covid patients in home isolation to check the level of oxygen in their blood.Doctors have been asking people in home isolation to check their oxygen level and to get admitted to hospital if it is below the prescribed level because they would need oxygen support.“We are getting calls on our helpline from people with fever… we are arranging doctors from our panel to provide them with consultancy. Many of these people are scared to get Covid tests done. We are counselling them and helping them get the tests done,” Pradyut Karmakar, convener of Covid Care Network at Ashoknagar and a member of a local club, said.Volunteers are busy dissuading people from barricading the house of a Covid patient, he said. “Still there is lack of awareness… people think barricading a house will prevent the spread of the virus.”Another member of the network said there was panic among people regarding hospital admission and treatment cost.Last week, several street plays were organised by a theatre group in Jadavpur and Garia to make people aware of the misconceptions regarding Covid-19. “Lot of misinformation about Covid is being shared on social media… it is creating confusion and panic among people. Through our play, we are trying to make people more aware,” Saikat Ghosh, director of Uncurtained, a theater group, said.The group has collaborated with Covid Care Network. “Many people are not wearing masks but they force a Covid patient in home isolation in their area to go to a hospital. Our message is we should maintain distancing rules but not socially abandon anyone because of the virus,” Ghosh said.There are a few people who stand on the road and watch the play, Ghosh said. “Many can relate to the problems… they say similar things have happened in their neighbourhood.",2020-08-30 02:23:00

1284,Subhankar Chowdhury,Partha to Centre: Defer JEE and NEET - Telegraph India,"Education minister Partha Chatterjee on Saturday asked Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank why he wanted to “jeopardise” the future of students by forcing them to write the JEE-Main and NEET exams during the pandemic.In a tweet three days before the start of JEE-Main, Chatterjee said: “Amid this global pandemic, @ Dr RP Nishank can you guarantee the safety of nearly 30 lakh students who have registered for JEE and NEET exams? With the transport system not fully operational, why do you want to jeopardise their future so desperately? Immediately postpone the exams!”The JEE-Main exams, through which most engineering colleges admit undergraduate students, are to be held from September 1 to 6.The National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET), through which all medical colleges admit undergraduate students, is scheduled for September 13.After chief minister Mamata Banerjee had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and Tuesday that the exams should be postponed, education minister Chatterjee made a fresh appeal before the Union minister.Pokhriyal on Wednesday justified holding the examinations during the pandemic and said the central government was under pressure from parents and students to conduct the tests.Travelling to exam centres at a time when transport is scarce is bound to pose a serious threat, an official of the state education department said.“Besides, health risk stemmed from the fact that students will have to turn up at centres to write the tests at a time when any kind of phy-sical assembly is being discouraged as a precaution against Covid,” the official said.Although the authorities that conduct the exams have issued guidelines on the precautionary measures to be taken by the students and others, any sort of assembly can pose a risk, he said.Minister Chatterjee has convened a virtual meeting with vice-chancellors on Monday afternoon to discuss when and how the examinations will be held for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students.The apex court had ordered on Friday that graduating students would have to write exams. The court had upheld a directive of the UGC issued on July 6.",2020-08-30 02:24:00
1285,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Kolkata kids demotivated in online class: Teachers - Telegraph India,"Teachers of several schools have reported that students have become “more subdued” in class and the energy level is much less than before.Months of being on the screen has made students “fatigued” and “demotivated”, psychiatrists and teachers said.Even students who are academically strong have not been responding like they used to, teachers of senior classes said. The “mischievous” ones who would always be up to something in classrooms have become “quiet and subdued”, a teacher said.“There are very few questions in classes now. It cannot be that all of them are following the lecture and have no doubts at all. Even when the devices are not on mute, there is hardly any conversation or noise. The students are quiet,” Joseph Chacko, who teaches English in the senior section at St James’ School, said. “It is a robotic experience for teachers and on many occasions, a faceless interaction.”Earlier, students would talk to a friendly teacher about their weekend plans or a web series they were watching; now, they respond to such questions with a yes or no, a teacher said.Students are attending online classes because they have to and not because they want to. “Online class for my daughter is more like a task. The excitement or interest is not there,” the father of a Class XII student said.Schools give breaks in between classes but because of connectivity issues, students have started logging in earlier, eating into the breaks, a parent said.“In the first month, things were fine but with time students are losing interest and a kind of boredom is setting in even for the bright kids,” Anil Jha, who teaches accounts in The Heritage School, said. “For students in senior classes or those who will appear for board exams there is pressure from teachers and parents.... which is taxing.”After attending classes online, often children are sitting for online tuition classes.“Teachers are trying but online classes are not the same as what school was for children. No wonder they are feeling demotivated and fatigued,” psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram said. “They have to attend continuous classes on the screen, at times not on laptops but on phones. All this while there is monotony of the same environment. It’s difficult to maintain a sense of well-being.”In an online class the “nuances of non-verbal communication is completely lost”, Ram said.This is something that has been disturbing teachers.“The connection in an online class is lost. In a classroom, there was unification; now, the student and the teacher are in two worlds,” Joeeta Basu, economics teacher at St Xavier’s Collegiate School, said.In several classes, most children answer in monosyllables. “In a physical classroom, I would discuss things not related to academics and they would eagerly share their experiences; now, they hardly respond. Maybe they don’t have anything to share because they are not going out, or they are not interested,” Chacko said.Mischievous students, too, have grown quiet. “Mischief is a group activity and it would happen because they could interact with one another,” Basu said.There should be a “more creative” solution, Ram said. “There should be more light-hearted activities at home and physical exercise to break the monotony of the cycle.”",2020-08-30 02:25:00
1286,Subhajoy Roy,You can be fined if you refuse to clean up after your pet - Telegraph India,"The civic body can now fine a pet owner for not cleaning the pet’s poop, a civic official said on Saturday.The civic body has been empowered to impose spot fines on pet owners and a gazette notification regarding this has been published, an official of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said on Saturday. The power to impose such fines came into effect on July 13.The fine amounts have been fixed at Rs 200 for the first offence, Rs 300 for the second offence and Rs 400 for every subsequent offence, the official said.Arguments between pet owners and people over who is responsible for cleaning the pet’s poop or if an owner has the right to dirty the road is common in Calcutta. The civic body could not do much as it did not have the legal right to impose spot fines even if waste cleaners or other civic officials were sure of the pet owner’s identity, a CMC official said.“We had to issue a notice to someone who would not clean the pet’s poop from the street. The matter used to come up for hearing at the municipal magistrate’s court, which had the sole power to impose fines,” the official said.The lengthy process meant a few people could be penalised. The recent change has given the CMC the power to fine a pet owner on the spot for not cleaning the pet’s poop.“The commissioner of the CMC will delegate the power to junior officials in wards or boroughs... they can fine an offender,” the official said.The fine amounts have been introduced under the CMC’s solid waste management rules.Civic waste cleaners often refuse to collect a pet’s poop till the time it gets dry because they say the poop gets stuck in the shovel, the official said. The poop left for a day or more on the street attracts insects and flies and can pose a health hazard for people living nearby.The CMC will upload the rules on its website, the official said. “We will give some time for people to get acquainted with the new rules and change their behaviour. We will start imposing fines after some time.”The new rules will not bring a blanket change, though, according to many civic officials. It will be very difficult to identify a pet owner unless the animal is found to defecate on the road when a CMC official is present, an official said. In most instances, owners take their pets out for a walk early in the morning or in the evening when CMC officials or cleaners are unlikely to be there. Also, arguments can break out if a pet owner refuses to pay the fine.Many owners act responsibly and carry poop pickers when they take their pets out for a walk, a pet owner said. Poop pickers or poop scoopers are available for Rs 495-Rs 599 on some e-commerce websites.Such fines have been allowed only in the Calcutta municipal area, an official of the government’s municipal affairs department said. But the government is thinking of extending the provision for fines to other municipal areas, at least the ones around Calcutta where keeping a pet is more common than faraway municipal areas where pets are a rarity, the official said.The new rules allow the CMC to impose fines on people who throw waste on roads. “The person can be fined Rs 1,000 for the first offence, Rs 1,500 for the second offence and Rs 2,000 for every subsequent offence,” a CMC official said.",2020-08-30 02:29:00
1287,Our Special Correspondent,"Student harassed, friend thrashed over use of road - Telegraph India","A college student from Belghoria has alleged that a group of youths harassed her and thrashed her friend when she went out with him on a scooter looking for chapatis on Friday night.In her complaint to police, the second-year BSc student has said a group of youths were fighting among themselves on the road near 17-Pally in Belghoria on Friday night. Trouble started when she tried to get past the group and some of them asked her to take a different route.It was around 10pm and when she refused, the youths threatened her and her friend. When they insisted on taking the road, some of them hurled abuses at the two, she said in her complaint. One of the youths took the scooter’s keys while another slapped her, she said.“She has said that when her friend tried to help her, some of the youths assaulted him,” an officer of Belghoria police station said. “He somehow managed to run away and alerted her mother.”The college student said she tried calling the police helpline but the call didn’t go through. Some of the youths then snatched her phone and asked her to delete the video she had recorded of the incident, she said in her complaint.Her mother reached the spot by then and alerted the police. By the time a team reached, the youths had fled. The woman then went to Belghoria police station to file the complaint.The police have started a case of outraging a woman’s modesty, forcibly stopping her on the way and assaulting her and her friend against a group of “unknown youths”.",2020-08-30 02:32:00
1288,Debraj Mitra,Unlock 4: Kolkata Metro prepares to resume service - Telegraph India,"Guards inside coaches are likely to be Metro Railway’s best bet on maintaining social distancing protocols once commercial service resumes, said officials.Suspension of tokens, access open to only smartcard-users and thermal scanning of passengers entering stations are other steps to be taken for resumption of commercial service.The absence of a mechanism to keep real-time track of passengers entering stations and trains has limited the options of the authorities. A shortfall in the number of Railway Protection Force personnel has increased the carrier’s dependency on the state government machinery to enforce the protocols.The Union home ministry’s Unlock 4 guidelines, issued on Saturday, allow “graded” resumption   of Metro services from September 7. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs — the nodal authority of Metro corporations in the country — is expected to meet senior officials of all city Metros this week before coming out with a set of guidelines for running trains.Calcutta Metro, however, is not a corporation and functions under the railway ministry. The railway board is expected to give some specific directions to Calcutta Metro on the resumption of commercial service.“As of now, nobody has told us to attend the meeting of the urban affairs ministry. We are waiting for directions from the railway board,” said an official.A meeting with state government officials will follow a nod from the railway ministry, said Metro officials.The home secretary of Bengal has already written to the chairman of the board, seeking resumption of commercial service of Metro.Metro takes stock of the preparedness of the city’s transport lifeline, grounded since March 25, in the run-up to possible resumption of service.  The carrier used to run 288 trains daily and the average daily passenger count was over six lakh.Metro sources said the trains and the stations were ready for resumption of commercial service but enforcing social distancing norms would be a real challenge.“There is no mechanism to ensure social distancing without physical intervention. It will be premature to say anything on our preparedness before the guidelines come. But we might have to depute security personnel inside coaches,” said a Metro official.Only a set of trains in the Metro fleet has CCTV cameras inside coaches. Live feed can only be accessed by the motormen. There are cameras at stations but not enough to track the number of passengers entering the concourse and the platform. Since the control room cannot access the live footage, there cannot be any instant direction to seal the gates of a train or platform, said officials.“Let us say the central guidelines allow 50 passengers per coach and 40 passengers board one on a New Garia-bound train from Dum Dum. How do we restrict the number in the subsequent stations?” said a Metro official.Keeping track of the number of passengers will be challenging because of the multiple origin and destination points. There are 24 stations on the route.“Once commercial service starts, tokens will be suspended. Only smartcard-users will be able to use the services. They can recharge the cards at the counters or from the Metro Railway website. An app for the smartcard-users is in the works,” Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said.But the carrier is not equipped to keep real-time track of the number of smartcards swiped at each gate.It is expected that passengers will have to undergo thermal screening before entering the stations. The Metro authorities will need police’s help in conducting the checks. “We will need police help in planning anything, both outside and inside the stations,” said another official.Metro’s security is the responsibility of the Railway Protection Force. But the RPF’s Metro contingent is working with a curtailed workforce. “The sanctioned strength is 900. We have a shortfall of around 130,” said an RPF official.RPF sources said the crunch was more acute because over 50 from the existing team have been sent to East-West Metro, which, once fully operational, will link Salt Lake Sector V with Howrah.On the table are options of closing the shutters at stations the moment the volume of passengers goes up, said officials. “We are used to doing it during the Puja rush. The permissible limit will be more at the terminal stations than the intermediate ones,” said an official.To counter the threat of transmission of the Covid-19 virus in an enclosed air-conditioning system, the quantum of fresh air will be increased on trains, said an official.“We will raise the supply of fresh air to the maximum level so that the existing air is not recirculated,” the official said.The frequent touch points like railings and handlebars will also be sanitised frequently once the services start, said the official.Sanitiser dispensing machines were installed at some Metro stations on Sunday. “All stations will be covered within a couple of days,” the official said.",2020-08-31 01:58:00
1289,Snehal Sengupta,Salt Lake patchwork wears out in 2 days - Telegraph India,"The Salt Lake civic authorities carried out patchwork repairs at the intersection of EM Bypass and Broadway, near the Sports Authority of India complex, just a couple of days back. The road surface has already started to wear out.The 50-m stretch, leading to both EM Bypass from Salt Lake as well as the Salt Lake-bound flank of Broadway, has potholes forming again as the materials used for repairs are being worn out under pressure of moving vehicles.Metro reported earlier this week how potholes were slowing down traffic, leading to snarls during rushing hours.“Vehicles invariably slow down in order to negotiate the stretch. The entire area is now littered with stone chips and that pose a risk to commuters,” said a traffic policeman posted at the crossing.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation carried out the patchwork repairs by levelling the stretch with a thin bituminous layer.A resident of HB block said his car nearly skidded off the road and hit the divider as he slammed the brakes to slow down for the potholes.“The surface is broken and undulating and takes one by surprise. The bad stretch suddenly appears after a smooth and wide one. On Friday, I suddenly met with an accident,” said Alok Dasgupta, an engineer who stays in HB block.Another Salt Lake resident said the repairs should have been more thorough. An official of the Salt Lake civic body said patchwork was the preferred mode of repairs because the sanction for an overhaul often came late.Another official was more forthcoming. Officials do not stand to gain much from a road that lasts long, he said. So, a short-term measure is often the first and the most preferred choice. “A road surface laid by mastic asphalt or concrete outlasts a surface redone with bitumen, which wears out faster. Every time one bags a contract for repair, he or she has to grease several palms in order to work peacefully. The results are there for everyone to see,” the official said.The economics of building roads makes mastic asphalt a better choice in the long run, an engineer of the road repairs department of the civic body said.Around Rs 4 crore is required to create a kilometre of mastic asphalt road. Though the cost is many times higher than patchwork repairs, it evens out in the long run because mastic asphalt doesn’t require frequent repairs.“A concrete road is three times costlier to build compared with a bitumen stretch of the same length but lasts two decades. The longevity of a bitumen stretch, on the other hand, is a few months. A mastic asphalt road costs double and lasts around five years,” the engineer said.A contract for patchwork doesn’t have a built-in guarantee period, an engineer of the Salt Lake civic body said. “Cracks or craters can reappear if it rains the very next day and nobody will be liable,” the engineer added.Tapas Chatterjee, the mayoral council member in charge of roads at the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, admitted that patchwork repairs had been carried out a few days ago at the EM Bypass-Broadway crossing but said he had no knowledge that the repairs had started to wear out. “We did not have the time to shut down entire roads and relay them. So, we did patchwork, which is time-saving. We will carry out thorough repairs soon,” said Chatterjee.",2020-08-31 02:35:00
1290,Kinsuk Basu,Awareness campaign on Covid home isolation - Telegraph India,"The health department has launched an initiative to spread awareness about what a Covid-19 patient should do while in home isolation to clear misconceptions and make it easier for doctors to handle such patients when they are rushed to hospital during an emergency.   The department, officials said, wants to explain to the people who can opt for home isolation after testing positive, the need to use pulse oximeters, the role of a caregiver at home and when a patient can return to normal life.Copies of synopsis of the guidelines for home isolation, drawn up by the ministry of health and family welfare, have been printed in Bengali and will be distributed as part of the campaign. The contents have been divided into sections dealing with who can stay in home isolation, when treatment is required and directives for caregivers.The campaign will be launched in parts of Bidhannagar, South Dum Dum, Baranagar, New Barrackpore and Barrackpore, the pockets that have seen a large number of Covid-19 cases. The leaflets — one lakh will be distributed in the next few days — list seven numbers of a Covid control room in North 24-Parganas and two WhatsApp numbers where one can post a message in an emergency. Health department officials said there were still misgivings among a large number of those who had opted for home isolation. Many patients are not aware why it is important to check their blood oxygen saturation frequently while at home. There are doubts about whether patients can meet visitors and when to call up and seek advice from a doctor.   As a result many patients are being brought to hospital in a critical condition.“A few days back, a senior citizen with several comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension turned up with a blood oxygen saturation level of 70 per cent. This patient could have been handled better (had there been proper awareness),” said Yogiraj Ray, a doctor attached to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata.  On the other hand, health department officials said, some patients whose level of infection is low enough for home isolation are looking for hospital beds.An overwhelming sense of fear and stigma about the infection is only making the situation more complicated. Metro has reported several times how neighbours are ostracising Covid patients and their families. “Misgivings go away when there is a clear understanding and that helps both patients and the doctors,” a health department official said. “We have observed that beds in safe homes in North 24-Parganas are lyingvacant. Many who have tested positive and lack enough space at home to stay isolated from others are unwilling to shift to safe homes,” an official posted in the Covid cell of North 24-Parganas said.Experts from Sasthya Bhavan who have been monitoring the condition of Covid-19 patients in hospitals have observed that on several occasions patients who were being brought in had progressed from stage II to stage III of the coronavirus infection and were in need of intensive care. “Many such patients could have been managed at home had the caregiver been aware about the parameters that need to be continuously monitored,” Ray said.",2020-08-31 02:57:00
1291,Snehal Sengupta,Leak triggers drinking water crisis in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"A couple of underground water pipes have leaked in Salt Lake, near the stadium, triggering a drinking water crisis in several blocks of Sector III of the township. The leaks were detected about three days back and the situation has only worsened by Sunday, engineers said. One of the leaked pipes carries water from Salt Lake’s tank number 13 to blocks such as IA, HA, GC, IC and KD-KC. The leak has been detected under Broadway, which links the township with the EM Bypass near the Salt Lake stadium's gate number 3A. A pool has formed on the artery, causing a large section of the asphalt to break and a crater to form.The other pipeline has sprung a leak near the FE island, also under Broadway, triggering a road cave-in. A layer of brick and sand has laid to level the stretch but the rough edges of the bricks are posing a threat to motorists.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) have carried out repairs but the bricks still lie exposed. Engineers at the civic body said lead joints in the pipe network were springing leaks because they were not sturdy enough to handle high pressure over a prolonged period.The joint near the stadium was supposed to be replaced with a mechanical one that employs steel gaskets and bolts to withstand high pressure of water, an engineer said. “But we could not do so because of a shortage of skilled labourers. Most of the labourers who specialise in jobs like this have gone home because of Covid-19,” he said.“We had started work near FE Island as it was more critical. We had barely completed the repairs when another joint started leaking near the Salt Lake stadium and a crater formed there as well,” said the engineer.Craters and potholes line the section of the road both near the FE island and near the stadium and are posing a safety threat to commuters. “I have seen several bikers skid while taking turns. It is plain luck that no major tragedy has taken place yet,” said Pratyush Chatterjee, a businessman and resident of Salt Lake. A scooterist skidded at the FE Block island crossing on the exposed bricks on Saturday.",2020-08-31 03:15:00
1292,Debraj Mitra,Unlock 4: Hoteliers to seek clarity on alcohol - Telegraph India,"An association of restaurant owners will write to the Bengal excise commissioner to seek clarity regarding serving alcohol.The Unlock 4 guidelines, issued on Saturday, have dropped bars from the prohibited list. A section of restaurant and bar owners is interpreting the latest guidelines as a nod to serve liquor. But many restaurant owners said there was no clarity on the issue.Seasoned restaurateurs said the excise commissioner should issue a circular that allows serving liquor inside restaurants and also give a date from when it can start.“Our interpretation is that we will be allowed to serve liquor. We welcome the decision. But we would seek more clarity from the excise department. We will write a letter to the excise commissioner,” said Sagar Daryani, the head of the National Restaurants Association of India’s Calcutta chapter.“We would want to serve liquor as soon as possible. But we need the excise department to give us a date,” said Gaurav Karnani, owner of The Grid, a microbrewery in Topsia.The Unlock 4 guidelines say: “In areas outside the containment zones, all activities will be permitted, except the following….” Bars find no mention, unlike the Unlock 3 guidelines.",2020-08-31 03:29:00
1293,Subhankar Chowdhury,Covid: IIT scholars seek time to leave campus  - Telegraph India,"Sixty-five research scholars at IIT Kharagpur wrote to the institute’s director on Saturday night that they were unable to leave the campus by Sunday and sought permission to stay on till the situation became normal.The students said they could not return home now because trains were not running and some of their family members had comorbidities. IIT Kharagpur director Virendra Kumar Tewari had on Wednesday urged the students who were still on the campus to leave by August 30 as 10 people, five of them students, had tested positive for Covid-19.“We will allow students who could not leave by Sunday to stay for a few more days, but they will have to leave at the earliest,” an official of the institute said.The students mentioned in the letter that some of them were from remote areas, which could only be reached by train. The government is yet to start regular train service.Family members of a number of students are aged and/or suffer from comorbidities. “In view of the rising number of Covid cases on the campus, parents are worried that we might take the dangerous virus home,” a student told Metro.For some students, floods in various places are coming in the way of returning home. This newspaper asked director Tewari about the students’ appeal. He said: “The students are like our children. I would urge them to go to their hometowns without further delay. We have kept them as long as possible. Now when cases have been reported, it is no longer safe to stay on the campus.” What about the problems the students mentioned in their letter to him? “They have to realise we are urging them to go as the institute is concerned about their health,” he said.The students blamed the institute for not letting them go home before the start of the lockdown. “When the IITs in Kanpur and Guwahati were vacating their hostels in March, we had requested the authorities here that we be allowed to go home. There were only a few Covid cases then. But the dean of students’ affair, Somesh Kumar, had said in a notice that it was safer to be on the campus,” said a research scholar.Repeated calls to Kumar went unanswered.Tewari said: “We have done everything for the welfare of our students. When the institute allowed the students to stay, several parents praised us. When we had asked them to vacate the hostels by June 20, most of them left. If they could go home, the remaining students too can.”",2020-08-31 03:38:00
1294,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya ,"During lockdown, a Kolkata magician proves that magic belongs to the magician - Telegraph India","All great magicians are named David, claims David Abhijit Nobo, laughing. There’s David Copperfield and David Blaine — and himself, a.k.a. Amazing David. But unlike the other two, he is a Calcuttan.At 32, Amazing David sees himself as belonging to the last of the magicians who learnt from books. “It’s easier now, with videos,” he says. But it is technology that has come to his rescue now and made him turn his bedroom into his studio, where he has installed a statue of Heath Ledger as Joker, framed Roald Dahl quotes, and a laptop. He is using his phone camera as a webcam.Magic is one of the oldest human arts, often a companion of religion, though charged, perhaps more than religion, with the possibilities of the dark and the illicit. Only around the 19th century in the West did it become established as a stage act for entertainment, a kind of theatre, which it remains till date. In India, the rope trick was another kind of performance. A few decades later, after Doug Henning, or David Copperfield performing on television, magicians began to be called “illusionists”.But throughout, like theatre, magic needed a live audience. The lockdown made the audience vanish.For Amazing David it meant work coming to an end. He is popular in the corporate event circuit, where a magic show often helps the transition from gruelling workday to mellow party hour. David, known for his comedy rope escape trick and liked for his friendly, genial manner, is among the higher-paid professionals in his bracket. He is a Bengali. His grandfather, Nobogopal Mukherjee, converted to Christianity and changed his name to Maurice Nobo.Initially after lockdown, David, who was in touch with other members of Kalkutta Konjurors, a platform for Calcutta magicians, did not know what to do. Then one day he pushed the bed out of his bedroom at his Park Circus residence, turned it into his studio (the current one is the third version) and put together an interactive show that the audience could enjoy online. He put up four ticketed events online, got some footage and sent them to event managers. He told them he could do corporate events again from home, where he also maintains several aquariums, terrariums (glass jars with plants and miniature landscapes), Java doves and a dog. Magic-from-Home began.David is now performing before corporate audiences again, online. At the end of June, he performed before a live audience of 1,500 from his home, on an online platform.It is not the same as before. Working magic is not easy. But its pull is irresistible. The theatre of magic combines fantasy, fiction, romance, role-playing and power. David could not help feeling drawn towards it.When he was in senior school at St James, Calcutta, instead of attending his private lessons, he would sneak away to the spot in front of Indian Museum where sat Basant Thapa, selling magic kits from a plastic sheet on the pavement. David learnt his first lessons in magic here, glimpsing scintillating worlds. By that time he was also heavily into Harry Potter. A bright boy with a curious mind, David learnt magic well but began to do poorly in academics.He did not fit into regular school, though he is very grateful to an actual play that he had participated in at school: the musical ‘Oliver’, directed by Katy Lai Roy for St James, in which he had played six to seven roles. It taught him a lot, also about magic. He feels the connection between theatre and magic deeply. “A magician is an actor who is playing the role of a magician,” he says.David began to perform magic professionally in schools when still very young. His mother Namita was his greatest support. By 2006, he was performing magic in almost every school of Calcutta. Though magic was entering a new age of sophistication and world influences, David was a bit of an anomaly in the often ill-paid, “vernacular” magic world of Calcutta. “One reason was my English,” says David. “Look, he can speak English!” a teacher at a school had apparently exclaimed to the principal, pointing at David.About this time, David also tried his hand at a call centre job, sometimes leaving in a local train at dawn with his suitcase to perform a show on the outskirts of Calcutta, and returned to his office. But he left the job as he felt his magic suffer.In 2010, he participated in a national television reality show on magic, staying in Mumbai. Following that, he began to perform at corporate events, as he wanted to perform magic before an adult audience.“It is not the trick per se. It is how I interact with my audience,” says David. “I draw them into a story.” For him, David Copperfield is the greatest magician of all times. “His flying act is the greatest illusion of all times.” But Copperfield is the greatest, says his Calcutta admirer, because also gives us a great story, an emotion, of people, of love.That is difficult online, but he is trying. He has also changed his acts, focusing on those which will survive closer scrutiny better. A lot of mind-reading remains, as do some sleights of hand, but his centrepiece, the rope escape, has been dropped.But fundamentally, he repeats, magic remains the same. “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” he quotes Arthur C. Clarke. This holds for magic, too, from Houdini through the P.C. Sorcars to now.On a video call, he asks me to tell him a close friend’s name. I do, and a few minutes later it appears on an envelope on its own. I gasp.But one thing has changed. “At the beginning, I would work with a lot of equipment. Now I can go without any,” says David. “Because I realise magic comes from the performer, not from the props.” You cannot separate the magic from the magician.Which is why magic stays even in the age of Google. “Now with all the information available, willing suspension of disbelief becomes that much harder,” he says. A Korean group online had taken in particular to exposing every trick. “But you can’t find magic by exposing the trick,” says David. “You can’t find music by pulling the piano apart.”",2020-08-31 03:47:00

1298,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus Lockdown: Some international airlines offer refunds - Telegraph India,"Some international airlines, including those that operated from Calcutta before flights were banned to contain the spread of the coronavirus, have said they are offering refunds to passengers who have failed to travel because of the lockdown.However, most airlines operating domestic flights are not giving refunds, though many have opened bookings after April 14, the day the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ends.Airline sources and tour operators said that though it was not clear whether flights would operate after April 14 if the lockdown was extended, some were still booking tickets.Singapore Airlines, in a message to travel agents, has said it would refund tickets under its Covid-19 Global Travel Waiver policy.The airline, however, has said in the message that the refund process could be delayed because of a backlog.German airline Lufthansa has also announced refunds for passengers meeting certain criteria.SpiceJet and IndiGo are not refunding fares. Instead, they are offering “credit shells”, by which the fare paid by a passenger is deposited in a credit fund.“The passengers will be able to use the fund when they travel at a later date within a stipulated period,” said an official of a low-cost airline. Will the policy remain the same for tickets booked for travel after April 14? “Yes, same as of now,” the official said.“We are not expecting too many bookings because there won’t be any leisure or business travel. We will probably operate 30 to 40 per cent of the total flights out of Calcutta,” said source in IndiGo.Air India, however, would start bookings after April 30, said a spokesperson for the airline.Tour operators said a few people, stuck in other cities or Calcutta, were making bookings post-April 14.“There are people who had gone to other cities on vacation and are stuck there. There are others who have been kept in quarantine facilities and don’t know where they will go after the surveillance period is over. These people are desperate to travel and are booking tickets,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India. A mother and her two children, residents of Calcutta, had gone to Agra to attend a family programme. They were scheduled to return a day before the lockdown but were unable to reach the airport.The family has now booked tickets on an IndiGo flight from Delhi to Calcutta on April 16.“We are not sure whether the flight will operate,” said the husband of the woman who is in their Calcutta home.",2020-09-04 20:01:00
1300,Mita Mukherjee,"Coronavirus lockdown: Fee hike hits hurdle, so does pay revision - Telegraph India","Several private schools are wary of implementing the Sixth Pay Commission recommendation because many guardians have said they cannot pay more fees at the moment.Most schools in the city had announced an increase in fees from this month but guardians have spoken of financial constraints because of the lockdown.Parents have approached school authorities, requesting them not to introduce the revised fees and instead allow them to pay the old fees till the present crisis is resolved, according to officials of several schools.Schools were supposed to implement the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations from April and pay teachers salaries on the revised pay scale from May.If the recommendations are implemented, a teacher's monthly gross salary will increase by close to 25 per centMany schools had announced a higher than usual fee hike from April to meet the increase in the annual expenditure to implement the revised pay scale.Some guardians had recently requested the state government to ask schools not to introduce the revised fees at this stage.Education minister Partha Chatterjee on Thursday requested private schools not to charge higher fees, considering the inconvenience caused to parents because of the lockdown.The principal of a school said the authorities were in a fix. “On the one hand, teachers and other employees would be deprived of their right if the revised pay scale is not implemented while on the other we cannot deny that some guardians have been affected by the lockdown,” the principal said. “Some guardians are faced with an acute financial problem as their businesses have been hit. We are trying to work out a policy, which will help both parties.”The principal of another school said his institution catered to students from different backgrounds — higher, middle and lower income groups.The school has decided not to ask parents to pay the revised fees for now, the principal said. “We had promised our teachers that the revised pay scale would be implemented in April. So, we plan to pay them the revised salary for three months. But we may not be able to continue doing so after three months if parents are not in a position to pay the revised fees.”In another school, parents have been asked to pay only the tuition fees this month. They can pay the annual and quarterly fees later, a school official said.Teachers of some schools said the management was supposed to announce the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission at the start of this month. But no such announcement has been made so far, they said.Some schools had introduced the revised pay scales immediately after the state government had in January announced its decision to implement the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations.",2020-09-04 20:11:00
1302,Anasuya Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Migrants worried over fast depleting funds in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Many of the service providers the city needs, more so during the lockdown, have left for home — plumbers, carpenters, gardeners or garage mechanics for example. Some, though, have not: be it by choice or accident. Many told The Telegraph they wanted to return home, but were unable to do so. Some said they had stayed back by choice but had not thought the lockdown would extend “this long”. A few said they could not board the last train from Howrah on March 22 and some failed to get on an overnight bus to home from Babughat. The reason: both were overcrowded. Now, these people are counting their money. They don’t know when they can pay their rent because they have to spend on food and their reserves are fast depleting. Some plumbers and gardeners from Odisha are almost down to begging and borrowing to sustain themselves as they wait for that window of opportunity to return home. Biplab Dhen had arrived in Calcutta from his home in Kendrapara, Odisha, in 1999 in search of a living. He found work as a plumber. “We get jobs from private contractors and individuals. I used to earn Rs 500 a day,” Dhen, whose parents and siblings are in Odisha, said. He has now been forced to stay put in his one-room tenement on Bondel Road, the monthly rent of which is Rs 1,500. “I last worked on March 18. I have told my landlord to wait till the middle of this month. I don’t know, though, how that will help. I had borrowed Rs 1,000 from a person and now I have about Rs 200 left,” Dhen, who has been subsisting on “alu makha and bhaat”, said.His fellow plumber Premanand Pradhan is from Kendrapara, too. Pradhan came to Calcutta two years ago. “I have my father, wife and son back at home. My father is old. I am the only one earning,” Pradhan, who hasn’t found work since the Janata Curfew, said. Pradhan and other plumbers can be found sitting on the footpath with their tools laid out before them at Golpark almost every day.“I used to earn Rs 350 a day,” Pradhan, who works as a helper, said. But now there is no work. Having missed the last bus from Babughat to his home in Kendrapara, Pradhan has requested one of his clients to let him stay in his garage. “For now I am living here and eating whatever I can manage.” He is worried for his family back home. “Won’t there be a bus anytime soon?”. Sunil Kumar Raut from Bhadrak and Nandan Kumar Raut from Jajpur have similar stories to tell. “I had worked on Saturday (the day before Janata Curfew) and from Sunday everything went under lockdown. Had I known, I would have left for home earlier,” the Jajpur resident who works as a plumber in the Chitralekha building near Bondel gate said. “I have borrowed some money from a person but that will last for a few days.”Some like Biplab, Premanand and a few others had thought of walking back home to Odisha like thousands of migrants across the country. “We had thought of walking back to our village but then police have sent us to quarantine centre,” Biplab said. Calcutta to Kendrapara is 373km via SH9 and 378 km if one takes NH16, according to Google Maps.",2020-09-04 20:24:00

Many others are sharing vehicles to reach their offices. We have provided adequate protective equipment and sanitisers at our offices for both employees and visitors, so that there is no fear,” said the official.Civic services in the Bidhannagar municipal area, such as garbage collection, have taken a hit because of manpower crunch.DB block resident Basudeb Basu said he had visited the borough office to request civic officials to clean a section of one of the block’s roads, where fallen tree branches had created an obstruction. He found the office locked.“I was surprised that nobody was around. I also wanted to request for a sanitisation drive of the block’s road as a part of our block has been sealed off after an elderly couple were admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms,” Basu said.A resident of Purbachal Housing Estate, who lost his father more than a month ago, has made multiple trips to the office of borough 6 to get the death certificate but had to return empty-handed.“I visited the office on Friday. There was no one. Some men standing nearby told me to come back once the lockdown is lifted,” said the resident.Minu Das Chakraborty, the chairman of borough 6, admitted that most of the employees were not turning up for work.“I am aware of the problem the residents are facing. We are trying to get the employees to work,” said Chakraborty.The chairperson of the corporation, Anita Mondal, said: “We will issue a circular asking the employees to report for work.”Mayor Krishna Chakraborty said she hoped things would normalise by next week.“We have asked the employees to report to the borough offices on a rotational basis. We have told them that they must attend office or face action. Many of them told me that they were feeling scared to go to work because of the coronavirus,” said Chakraborty.",2020-09-05 21:53:00
1305,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus lockdown: OPD to close at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital - Telegraph India,"All outpatient departments at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, barring the anti-retroviral therapy clinic and the fever clinic, will shut from Monday as the facility has been turned into a 500-bed Covid-19 treatment centre.The anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinic has been kept open because the patients who are treated in the clinic collect medicines from there. “They will suffer serious consequences if they miss a cycle of their medicines,” a hospital official said. Only a few other hospitals run the ART clinic, so closing it would inconvenience HIV patients.“Our fever clinic - where anyone with fever and other symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 are examined - will also remain open,” said Indranil Biswas, the medical superintendent of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.Patients who were undergoing dialysis and chemotherapy at the hospital would be informed by the health department about where they can undergo their next cycles of treatment. “The Calcutta Medical College authorities have sent the names of patients who were undergoing chemotherapy and dialysis at the hospital to the health department. The department will soon contact them and inform them about the next course of action,” said a health department official. When MR Bangur Hospital was converted into a Covid-19 hospital, patients who used to undergo chemotherapy and dialysis there were given alternatives near their homes, the official said. All departments at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital have been transformed into Covid-19 wards. “A patient with cardiac ailments who also tests positive for Covid-19 has to be kept at the cardiology department. Besides treating her/him for the novel coronavirus infection, doctors also have to monitor the heart. Similarly, patients with neurological problems testing positive for Covid-19 have to be treated at the neuro department because they will also have to be monitored for neurological problems. So, effectively all departments have to stay prepared for Covid-19 patients,” a health department official said.",2020-09-05 21:53:00
1306,A Staff Reporter,CCTV footage ‘nails’ chain snatchers in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Footage from a couple of CCTV cameras placed on separate houses in Salt Lake helped police nab two scooter-borne men who had allegedly snatched a gold chain from a woman walking back home in GD block a few days ago, officers said.Manish Singh, 20, and a teenager, both of whom hail from the Girish Park area in north Calcutta, were stopped while they were riding a scooter at a police check post in Golaghata, near Lake Town, on Friday evening, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.The cops had stopped them to know why they had stepped out in violation of the lockdown rules. But they soon came to know that the duo’s photographs as well as that of the two-wheeler had been circulated among all police stations because they were suspected to be involved in the snatching in GD block a few days ago.“The description of the two-wheeler as well as these men matched the photographs that had been sent to all police stations under the Bidhannahar commissionerate as well as under Calcutta police. We took them to the police station,” an officer of Lake Town police station said.“The two initially denied having been involved in the snatching but broke down after the officers showed them their photographs captured by two CCTV cameras installed on separate houses,” the officer said.Manish and the teenager both apparently told the cops that they would wander around in Salt Lake and adjoining areas keeping an eye out for women and the elderly.Once they spotted an easy target, they would snatch their valuables and speed away on the scooter.The cops then took Manish to his home, where he reportedly handed over the gold chain to them.Another officer of the commissionerate said the incident again highlighted the importance of installing CCTV cameras on houses.“Cameras help in detecting crime and are a deterrent to crime,” the officer said.",2020-09-05 21:53:00
1308,,Property e-registration takes off in New Town - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government’s efforts to promote e-registration of property have slowly started to yield results.The government had announced a financial incentive to encourage home buyers to register their property during the lockdown without physically visiting registrars’ offices.The decision, which came into effect on April 20, was designed to open the tap for much-needed revenue for the cash-starved state. Property registration fees and stamp duty represent some of the biggest contributors to the state’s exchequer.Government officials said the office of registrar had received 100 deeds online so far and 50 have been accepted. The others have been reverted to the applicants for minor corrections.“Being a new module, the response initially was slow. But it is now starting to pick up,” a finance ministry official said.The office of the inspector general of registration and commissioner of stamp revenue has so far only introduced e-deeds for sale/purchase of immovable property registration. From next week, it will add modules for sale agreements, lease agreements and gift deeds as well.Metro has tracked down a buyer who has used the e-registration facility to pay the registration fee and stamp duty and register the deed of conveyance – and tried to understand how the new system works.Sanghamitra Sen, a teacher with a government school, and her husband Sanjay, a senior executive with a pharmaceutical company, completed the registration process on Thursday evening.The duo had booked a 1,100sq ft flat in Rajarhat some time back. The property was complete and ready for handover in March, when Covid-19 struck.They had taken a home loan from the State Bank of India and the draft of final payment to the builder was ready by March 12.“Everything went haywire. The bank was ready to disburse the last instalment and the developer was ready to hand over the property. But we could not proceed further,” said Sanghamitra Sen, from her Barasat home.After seeing the government announcement on fiscal incentive (rebate of up to Rs 20,000 on registration fee), Sen got in touch with Siddha Group, with whom she had booked the flat, to explore the new process. “We are paying pre-EMI interest. Moreover, the validity of the draft is time-bound. Hence, we decided to go ahead,” said Sanjay Sen.The Sidhha Group and Sen then exchanged the draft deed of conveyance and the legal legwork was done at the developer’s end.The deed was finally submitted to the office of the inspector-general of registration (IGR) with a digital signature.“I did not have to visit their office once,” Sen said. He, however, will have to visit the registrar’s office after lockdown is lifted to complete the biometrics process.Sen will be given preference over others while completing the formalities, which means he won’t have to spend too much time at the registrar’s office.Buoyed by the success, the Siddha Group owner, Sanjay Jain, has asked his team to initiate 23 more online registrations by Friday evening. “There are about 700 flats that we are ready to hand over. We plan to do all of them within a month or two,” Jain said.The process will also ensure social distancing as it guarantees minimal people-to-people contact, he added.The e-process will also mean cash flow for the developer as he would be able to draw down the last instalment from the buyer.The real estate industry said the system would be more popular over time as the IGR’s office continues to fine tune the process to make it more seamless without compromising on the legalities involved in property transactions and mortgage creation.“We expect the number to go up as the government is going to allow sale and lease registrations. This will help us convert the initial bookings into concrete transactions,” a developer said.If the e-registration process runs smoothly, it will set the ball rolling for the real estate industry which has been hit very hard due to the virus outbreak.",2020-09-05 21:54:00
1309,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Teachers fear drop out after lockdown lifts - Telegraph India,"Students will drop out of schools in rural Bengal in large numbers after the lockdown is over and classes resume, the heads of many schools in the districts fear. Boys might be sent to work and girls married off, and teachers will again have to start from scratch to get students back to school. In rural areas, getting children to school means convincing their parents, who would rather send their wards to work than send them to classes. As for daughters, getting them married would mean having one mouth less to feed. The lockdown has impacted the livelihood in many homes who are living on aid or have barely any food. Whenever normal life resumes, survival and not education will be their priority, a headmaster told Metro.In many homes, fathers work as masons outside the state, do fishing or till other people's land. Mothers mostly roll bidis at home.“They will think about how and from where they will get their daily food. To study and stand on their own feet and have a career is something they won’t be able to spare a thought to when they will fight for survival,” said Murshida Khatun, the headmistress of Debkunda Sk Abdur Razzak Memorial Girls High Madarsah in Murshidabad's Beldanga block.Khatun said the long break from school because of Covid-19 would be a “life-long loss for many students”.“The session starts in January and these are important months for us, when a large portion of the syllabus is covered. We worked hard to get these girls to school. The long gap from school will undo a lot of that,” said Khatun.Most students of urban schools are being pushed by their parents to attend online classes. In contrast, in most village schools, barely 10 to 30 per cent of the students are able to attend online classes.They either do not have smartphones or do not have the money to recharge phones.“They are silently preparing to get the girls married in families whose financial condition is better than their own. Around 70 per cent of our students are detached from studies and there could be a drop out of about 40 per cent. Education will be secondary for them with an increase in unemployment,” said Chandan Maity, the headmaster of Krishnachandrapur High School in the Mathurapur constituency in South 24-Parganas.",2020-09-05 22:02:00
1311,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus outbreak: Patient dumped at MR Bangur Hospital  - Telegraph India,"An elderly man with symptoms of Covid-19 was brought to MR Bangur Hospital in an ambulance and was allegedly abandoned on the premises on Friday evening, leaving him clueless what to do next. The man, wearing a medical gown with a catheter attached, was spotted sitting alone on the pavement by a hospital employee and taken inside. The hospital has alerted police, who are trying to track details of the ambulance.Police during investigation have come across CCTV footage that shows the man slowly coming out of an ambulance, adjusting his gown and his catheter before settling down on the pavement. Another man, standing a few meters away, is seen closing the backdoor of the ambulance once the old man sits down on the pavement. The ambulance then moves out.According to a hospital official, the man looked “ill” and has been admitted. “He has not been able to speak. So, we are yet to know his name and other details. But we have informed the local police about the incident,” said a senior official at MR Bangur Hospital.Sources said the police had traced the ambulance from the CCTV footage and found that it was registered in the name of a person who lives in Jagaddal, South 24-Parganas.Officers said they were also trying to zero in on the identity of the hospital through its logo on the patient’s gown.Several incidents have been reported in the recent past of ambulance drivers trying to dump suspected Covid-19 patients on the road, refusing to drive them till their destination.Similar incidents happened in Howrah and Naktala. In both cases, people wearing PPE were seen taking out patients from ambulances and trying to abandon them before they were forced by residents of the areas not to do so.“We are trying to establish the identity of the man (dumped at MR Bangur). Simultaneously, the process to find out the hospital or nursing home where he was admitted is equally important,” said an officer of Jadavpur police station.",2020-09-05 22:07:00
1312,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak in Bengal: Health department sets up respiratory cases panel    - Telegraph India,"The health department has set up a 12-member committee of teachers of community medicine from medical colleges to find out whether proper steps are being taken to manage cases of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). The committee will draw up a report and submit it to the health department every day by 6pm.The state government has identified over 91,000 cases of influenza-like illness and over 800 with severe acute respiratory illness following door-to door surveillance over the past month. “The surveillance gives us early warning signals and is an important proactive step in fighting Covid-19,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said in a recent Facebook post.Senior officials in the health department said that apart from Calcutta, the team will also focus on North and South 24-Parganas and Hooghly to assess the preparedness in tackling these cases.“The team will find out the number of ILI and SARI cases identified and samples sent for tests,” said a health department official. 'The experts will analyse weekly reports and identify ILI and SARI clusters.”The World Health Organisation has defined ILI as fever above 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and cough, which had started within the past 10 days. SARI has similar symptoms but a person with the disease needs hospitalisation because of the distress. Health department officials said once the committee identified ILI and SARI clusters, the government would immediately arrange for complete lockdown of the regions and bring more people within the ambit of tests.“All hospitals have been told to inform the department about any ILI or SARI patient admitted,” the health department official said.",2020-09-05 22:18:00
1313,Our Special Correspondent,Chitpore trader quizzed for crass tweets - Telegraph India,"A 30-year-old Chitpore trader was questioned on Saturday for allegedly posting crass and objectionable remarks on the Twitter handle of a Mumbai woman who had expressed her grief on the death of the migrant labourers on the railway tracks in Aurangabad. The man, in his 30s, who had been using a Twitter handle called @pokersash, is said to have defended his words. An officer quoted him as saying he “could not imagine how the Indian railway minister could be blamed for some migrant labourers who died because they fell asleep on the tracks”.The tweet, made on May 8, was deleted soon after it caught the attention of several thousands of social media users and attracted criticism for the “sexist remarks” it contained. @pokersash used to be followed by some top BJP leaders. But the Twitter handle has been deactivated following outrage over his latest remarks.Police sources said his phone, which was apparently used to write the post, has been seized as part of the investigation. The police said this was not the first time this account had been suspended by Twitter for posting objectionable comments. “He is a repeat offender. But not many people lodge a complaint,” an officer said.A case has been started against the man under IPC sections related to sexual harassment, stalking, public mischief, criminal intimidation and the Information Technology Act.",2020-09-05 22:25:00
1314,Kinsuk Basu,Pool tests to gauge coronavirus spread in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"The health department has decided to start pool testing of samples for faster detection of positive and negative cases of Covid-19 across Calcutta.In this method, samples of four to five persons will be mixed and then tested for quicker assessment of areas where the disease may have spread wide.Primarily, at least 10 areas of Calcutta, including Belgachia, Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Tiljala, Tangra, Burrabazar and Rajabazar, have been identified for pool tests.Virologists said swab samples of four to five persons are mixed and then put to test in a batch. If a pool test is positive, individual samples of the batch are retested.And if a pool test is negative, all samples are considered negative.The Indian Council of Medical Research has said in its advisory that pooling of more than five samples is not recommended to avoid dilution, which may lead to false negatives. The advisory has also said that as few as two samples can be pooled.The test is carried out using the standard methodology of polymerase chain reaction after RNA extraction.The health department has decided to set up camps where doctors, nurses and lab technicians will be present to draw swabs.“We are focusing on certain areas of the city within containment zones, which have high density of population in clusters, for pool tests. If one sample of four to five persons turns out to be positive, it would be indicative of the spread of the coronavirus,” said a health department official.“The pool test results will help us draw up the next course of action for these containment zones.”Last available figures from the health department show Calcutta has 596 active coronavirus cases, highest among all districts of Bengal.Of the 99 Covid-19 deaths across the state, Calcutta accounted for 64, according to information provided by the health department.On Friday, the number of containment zones in Calcutta shot up to 326 from 319 on Thursday suggesting fresh evidence of the virus spread.“In densely populated areas, pool tests will help us zoom in on specific wards in certain boroughs within the limits of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation,” a health department official said. “We have already collected data from the CMC’s health department to identify large cluster population where tests would have to start immediately.”",2020-09-05 22:30:00
1315,Our Special Correspondent,Semester final exam one-month window after colleges and universities reopen - Telegraph India,"The postponed final semester exams of undergraduate and postgraduate courses will be held a month after the colleges and universities reopen following the withdrawal of the lockdown, education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Saturday.“The final semester exams of all undergraduate and postgraduate courses will be held one month after the colleges and universities reopen. The universities have started the preparations to conduct the exams,” Chatterjee said after a meeting.Affiliating universities such as Calcutta University will conduct the final or sixth semester exams of its undergraduate courses at home centres, an official of the education department said. Which means the students will write the test in their respective colleges.This marks a break with the tradition because all undergraduate semester exams, conducted by the affiliating universities, are held at away centres.  In another shift, the last semester exams will be held in phases and on different sets of question papers, the official said. The test on a single paper will be held in two or three days.    If a college has 500 candidates, not all will write the test on the same day and on the same set of questions.However, the individual universities will have the liberty to use any other procedure if they want to, the official said.The decision was taken at a meeting education minister Chatterjee held on Saturday with the vice-chancellors of all universities and senior officials of the higher education department through video conference.The state government had announced that all educational institutions in Bengal would remain closed till June 10 for the coronavirus outbreak.",2020-09-05 22:41:00
1317,Subhajoy Roy,Families refuse bodies of non-Covid-19 patients - Telegraph India,"Family members of some deceased patients who were admitted with symptoms of Covid-19 but tested negative are not taking the bodies for cremation, Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, told officials on Saturday.“The bodies of some people who tested negative for Covid-19 and died for other reasons are lying unclaimed in hospitals. Families are not taking these bodies. It has been decided that the CMC will perform the cremation. The families have to give in writing to the hospital that they will not receive the bodies,” an official quoted Hakim as saying.The problem was acute at MR Bangur Hospital, one of the designated Covid-19 treatment centres in Calcutta, a CMC official said later.An official said families were afraid that receiving the bodies and taking them to crematoria could infect them with the novel coronavirus.“Many patients are being admitted in hospitals with symptoms of Covid-19. Some of them are testing negative for the disease but dying for some other reason. The families of some such patients are refusing to accept the bodies,” said the official.The CMC has been entrusted with the responsibility to perform the cremation or burial of all those who are dying after testing positive for Covid-19 in the city. The cremation is done according to guidelines issued by the Union health ministry.CMC officials carry the body, packed in a specific material, in a hearse whose driver wears personal protective equipment. The bodies are taken to the cremation ground at Dhapa or a burial ground at Bagmari.There is, however, no such guideline for people who die from other illnesses after testing negative for Covid-19.Sample collection vansThe CMC is retrofitting six ambulances and converting them into swab collection vans, officials said.An official said the vans would visit the worst-affected pockets of the city, slums and other densely populated areas, from where multiple Covid-19 cases have been reported, to collect swab samples.Two laboratory technicians will be inside the ambulance. A partition of glass has been built inside the ambulance. The technicians will sit on one side of the partition and the person whose sample will be collected on the other side.“We will also install 10 stationary kiosks for sample collection in affected areas. The mobile vans and kiosks will start functioning within a week,” said the official.“Our teams are now visiting localities in cars and stepping out for sample collection. Once the mobile vans are ready, these vans will go inside lanes and bylanes to collect swab samples,” said the official.Civic officials said these measures would enable them to test more people in affected areas so that more positive cases are quickly identified and isolated to prevent the spread of the virus.",2020-09-05 22:56:00
1319,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Role of the women of the house as seen through the eye of the child - Telegraph India,"The lockdown has opened our eyes to the unsung contribution of the woman of the house in running the show at home.An NGO has started an initiative to recognise the role of the woman in supporting the family despite the adversities amid the lockdown.The event celebrating the role of the women was organised by Agantuk Santoshpur. The child in the family has been asked to pen a write-up or draw a sketch in recognition of the role played by the woman.Timir Baran Das, a member of the NGO, said they had named the campaign “Aamar Ma, Sera Ma (My mom is the best)” to mark International Mother’s Day, which will be celebrated on Sunday.The role of a woman in the house, which has always been challenging, is now more critical amid the pandemic because of a slew of factors, explained teachers and women rights activists who work on gender issues.All of them said the rise in the number of complaints about domestic violence during the lockdown suggested how uncomfortable a woman’s life had become in many houses.A teacher of sociology at Presidency University said the role of women could be split into several categories to understand the magnitude of the challenge.Sukanya Sarbadhikary said one of the categories would be that of a mother who was working from home and had to manage the family, with her husband and children being present 24X7.This at a time when she does not have a domestic help to assist her.For such women, who have to juggle so many roles, time management becomes an issue and adds to the stress.“The insecurity of job does bother her like the men. Yet, she has to overcome that and keep the show running, taking out time for household chores without any complaint,” said Sukanya.There is another category, comprising working women who are not presently working from home.They are still entering the space of a homemaker, which is entirely new to them. “Nobody would recognise that, and if there is minor slip up, the knives will be out for her,” added Sukanya.Although there has been a shift in some sections, many women The Telegraph spoke to said the average Indian husband did not feel the urge to share the wife’s workload  and the pandemic had only worsened the situation.Women’s rights activist Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti said the prevalent patriarchy ensured that even if the man in the family wanted to help his wife, the family’s elderly woman, be it the mother or the mother-in-law, quashed the effort.“This is called shadow patriarchy. The men are made to believe that the household cannot be the domain of men,” said Chatterjee Chakraborti.Speaking about Sunday’s event, mental health professional Farishta Dastur Mukerji said a child was the best person to celebrate the fight of a woman. “His candour would make him a perfect judge,” said Mukerji.Anuradha Kapoor, director of Swayam, a Calcutta NGO working on violence against women said, the role of women in the house, whether pandemic or not, has always been undervalued.“The household work that women do is not considered as work. It was interesting that an initiative has been started to value the work,” said Kapoor.",2020-09-05 23:00:00
1321,TT Bureau,Helpline for PPE for coronavirus fighters in West Bengal - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has denied any shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers involved in the battle against Covid-19 and launched a helpline for those who still have complaints.“In order to provide an institutional channel for the ventilation of issues regarding the non-availability or insufficiency of PPE and other supplies, the (health) department has set up a dedicated helpline (1800-120-444-222),” a notice issued on Saturday said.The helpline will be operational from 8am to 8pm every day.“The state government is according highest priority to the procurement and supply of PPE to the frontline health workers engaged in combating Covid-19,” the health department said.The notice cited how 'in spite of a comfortable stock position, reports are received from some medical personnel from time to time about the insufficiency or non-supply of PPE”.A section of social media users, some of them doctors, have been writing about the alleged shortage of PPE kits in Bengal.Some private hospitals, not the ones designated as Covid-19 treatment centres, have been accused of overcharging patients for personal protective equipment equipment.“Regular supplies are being dispatched to the health facilities located across the state and the stock position of PPE and other supplies at different levels of the state health system is comfortable,” the health department said on Saturday.",2020-09-05 23:06:00
1322,Subhankar Chowdhury,Less costly kit by city team gets ICMR nod  - Telegraph India,"A low-cost kit to detect Covid-19, developed by scientists in Calcutta, has got the green signal from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and can now go into commercial production.The team was led by Samit Adhya, a former scientist with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Calcutta, and Koustubh Panda, the head of the biotechnology department at Calcutta University.The kit costs Rs 500, less than half the price of the kits available now. It can detect the virus within 90 minutes and is capable of doing so at an extremely low viral load — at an early stage of the infection, said the researchers.The scientists carried the seeds of their idea to a biotech company based in Bakrahat, South 24-Parganas, and collaborated with a team of young scientists there to produce the kits.The ICMR has on its website listed GCC Biotech, the Bakrahat firm, among the 21 companies that have been certified based on the performance evaluation of their kits.Panda has been writing for The Telegraph since early February on the dangers posed by the pandemic and the need to carry out large-scale tests.On Saturday, he said that while he and Adhya occasionally visited the lab, 30km from the city, a group of youngscientists was cooped there from early March as they did not have the option of travelling daily because of the lockdown.Besides Panda and Adhya, the team had Avijit Ghosh, Joydeep Mitra, Mohammad Nadeem Khan, Surajit Maity, Gairik Chatterjee and Pinaki Mukherjee.A scientist who is part of the team said they could bring down the cost because of the fact that indigenous components were used.The kit is made without depending on imported reagents, which the scientists indigenously developed. “That does not mean we compromised on quality. It follows all the quality assurance guidelines of the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” said one of the scientists.Explaining the need for the low-cost kit, Koustubh told Metro on Saturday that the virus did not discriminate between the rich and the poor and so there was a need to conduct tests on as many people as possible.“Given that 80 per cent of the people are asymptomatic, a large-scale community screening is essential. When you need to test millions of poor people, the price of the test kits becomes the most decisive factor in determining its accessibility,” said Panda.Calcutta University vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee spoke about how most scientists in the group were former CU students and she congratulated Panda for his contribution.",2020-09-05 23:16:00
1323,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus crisis eats into doctors’ income - Telegraph India,"Most private hospitals in the city have either reduced the pay of doctors who draw a fixed salary or are withholding consultation fees of others because of the financial turmoil unleashed by the pandemic.In most cases, junior doctors have not been affected but incomes of seniors have reduced, in some cases by half.A senior doctor at a private hospital said his fees for consultation, surgery and procedures for February were still due.“The hospital has been able to pay barely 10 per cent of my fees for February, which I usually get in March. The authorities have said they would be able to pay only after they get a loan,” the doctor said.Another senior surgeon said he was not receiving the cheques from the hospital for the surgeries he had done during the lockdown.Doctors of a private hospital said the management had informed them that their salaries had been reduced by 50 per cent from this month.Private hospitals said their earnings were down 20 to 30 per cent and they have no money to pay senior doctors, whose remunerations are high.“The hospitals have become cash-strapped. Private corporates, who are a big source of income for us, are not able to pay. Besides, many payments that we receive at the end of the financial year are due,” said Subhasish Datta, the chief general manager of Ruby General Hospital.Huge dues from the state and central governments (the governments owe the hospitals money for treating their employees under health schemes) as well as corporate clients have made these hospitals cash-strapped, said officials.The earnings have also been affected by low occupancy because of the lockdown, said officials.Datta said Ruby was yet to get about Rs 25 crore from various agencies.“We have to buy a huge volume of personal protective equipment, sanitisers, gloves and other protective gear, for which the suppliers are insisting on upfront payment. So, from May we have to reduce salaries of doctors,” he said.Medica Superspecialty Hospital has cut up to 50 per cent of the payment for doctors, said its chairman Alok Roy.“The central government owes me Rs 10 crore under various health schemes. I have not received any amount for the last couple of months. But patients keep coming and we have to treat them,” said Roy.Metro had reported in April that Roy had tweeted to the Prime Minister urging him to pay income tax refunds.“The government has refused to pay extra for PPE for patients under the ex-servicemen health scheme. It is also not paying for the Covid-19 tests,” said Roy.K.K. Aggarwal, president, Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania, and past president, Indian Medical Association, said: “The governments should come forward and support private sector doctors.”“We are expecting that once the lockdown is lifted, the offices will start functioning and dues will be paid,” said Rupak Barua, the group CEO of AMRI Hospitals. The hospital has also resorted to pay-cuts for senior doctors, he said.",2020-09-05 23:18:00
1325,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus Lockdown: Digital gap: Jadavpur University to go extra mile - Telegraph India,"Jadavpur University will send its employees to students’ homes to fetch assignments or projects that they fail to mail or send through WhatsApp for want of a device or Net connectivity.The university will send its personnel either on car or on train depending on the distance to collect assignments and projects, which are part of the internal assessment.Internal assessment will be factored in while evaluating engineering students in the final semester, a university official said.The engineering faculty had in early June decided that students would be assessed by factoring in 30 per cent weightage of the best of semester grade point average (SGPA) from previous semesters and the remaining from internal assessments.Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, who had in April advised teachers against online evaluation/grading for internal assessments because of the “digital divide” faced by a student, told Metro on Tuesday that the mechanism had been planned so that “no one feels left out”.A student may not have access to a computer or may have connectivity issues in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan, Das said. “We have to think of the student who is on the other side of the digital divide. We all know how a student in Kerala was forced to commit suicide because of such constraints. We will go to unparalleled lengths so that no one feels left out because of the digital divide.”The Telegraph had on June 3 reported that a 14-year-old school student in Kerala committed suicide after her father, a daily labourer who was ill and had no work during the lockdown, failed to repair the TV, through which she was attend virtual classes.The university has started preparing a list of the students who will require the service.The university will send men on a vehicle for up to 30km from the campus, an official said. “If a group of students live in the remote corners of North and South 24-Parganas districts that have been battered the most by the cyclone, the men will be sent on vehicle to collect the copies at one go.”If a student lives in far-off places like Malda, the officials will go on a train, the official said.Another official said the service would be restricted within the boundaries of Bengal.The university has students from Kashmir, which has largely faced Internet lockdown since the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year. Students have returned to the valley when the lockdown was imposed on March 23. “They can courier the copies. If they have financial constraints, the university will help,” the vice-chancellor said.Even for those in the state, the university is planning to engage couriers. “The mode of service will be decided in consultation with individual students. We want to wrap up the BTech assessment by July 11,” he said.In April, he had asked teachers to be “cautious” while conducting online classes or sharing digital content because of the digital divide.",2020-09-06 20:43:00

1328,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus pandemic: Indian community in UK reaches out to campuses to aid students - Telegraph India,"They have their back to the wall on foreign soil yet cannot afford to return.  The lockdown has jeopardised life for Indian students in British institutes of higher education. Now local Bengali associations along with other Indian communities have come to their aid.“Our weekly earnings from working for 20 hours have dried up with all shops downing shutters. We rely heavily on that money for our rent and boarding. Without a car I cannot reach the Indian grocery stores as taking public transport has risk of Covid-19 infection. My Indian friends at the London School of Fashion too are surviving on bread and soup,” said Samrat Dutta, a marketing student of Kingston University.Barsha Bhattacharya, an MBA student, was in even worse state. The Bagha Jatin girl had landed barely three months ago to study at the University of South Wales. She came on a student loan and needed a job. But on March 23, lockdown started in the UK. Back in Calcutta, her father was not getting his salary and suddenly she was on her own. “I am desperate for work. Though it is risky to go out, I have my rent, electricity and gas bills to pay at the apartment I am sharing with three others.”Things reached such a head that for two weeks she survived only on lunch. “But my health deteriorated so much that I had to start eating at night.”At this point, she heard of a group created by an Indian students’ union to help those facing financial problems and provide them with free groceries. Soon, a month’s supply reached her and Samrat.The supplies were funded by a consortium of social groups of non-resident Indians. “Thirty per cent of the foreign students here are Indians. When they could not find work and pay rent, many faced eviction threats. Some faced food scarcity. We are working with the Indian National Students Association and other groups,” said Vikram Banerjee of Basingstoke Hindu Society, who is also a member of Sewa Day.“In Cardiff, we provided funds with which the association helped students. Some got packets of daal, ata, rice, oil etc. Others got supermarket vouchers,” he added.In Slough, Adda Slough cooks 150 meals twice a day at the local temple. “We are transferring funds to students’ unions,” said president Nilotpal Mandal. “We connected with students in the west London suburbs.  Together with our associates, we have helped about 150 students,” said Prasenjit Bhattacharjee, a member.",2020-09-06 20:48:00
1329,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Plan for more isolation facilities in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Bengal plans to create isolation facilities for new coronavirus patients with no or mild symptoms because there is fear of a spike in numbers following the relaxation in lockdown norms.State government officials are holding discussions on creating such facilities in Calcutta and other parts of Bengal, including in villages, as they feel there can be many patients with mild symptoms who don’t need to be admitted to hospitals.Home isolation will not be safe for a large section of such patients as they don’t have such facilities at their homes and infection will further spread rapidly, the officials feel.On Tuesday, there were 372 confirmed Covid-19 positive patients in Bengal, taking the total count till June 9 to 8,985. According to the state health department, Bengal has 8,785 earmarked Covid-19 beds with almost 23 per cent occupancy as on June 9.“But with lockdown norms eased, there is an apprehension that the number of new cases can go up very sharply even up to 1,000 daily. We have to be prepared for such an eventuality,” an official said. If more beds are dedicated to Covid patients, the treatment of those suffering from other diseases can get “seriously affected”, the official said.The health ministry had issued guidelines, saying pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients or those with very mild symptoms can stay in home isolation provided they follow the rules such as wearing a triple-layer mask, staying in room away from other people at home, especially the elderly, and not sharing personal items with others.Distancing rules cannot be maintained in slums and many villages in Bengal where several people share one room and have common washrooms, according to officials and public health experts.Also, in Calcutta and other towns in Bengal, maintaining isolation in small apartments is a problem. Many families have elderly parents staying with their children and grandchildren.Government schools, community centres and other institutional buildings can be used to keep mild symptomatic patients in isolation.“Most people infected by Covid-19 are getting cured. So, it is not advisable to overburden hospitals with such patients who don’t need critical care support. It is emerging that people with mild or no symptoms can be managed very well in community settings in an isolated facility and under daily supervision of trained health workers,” Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health expert, said.“Health workers should be trained to identify critical symptoms in any of these people and then they should be admitted to hospitals. This will provide a contextually responsive humane participatory management protocol and try to remove the fear and stigma prevalent in the society now.”Earlier, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had tried to create quarantine facilities in Calcutta. But the plan had to be abandoned because of opposition from residents.“But now, with the number of cases and deaths going up every day, people have realised the scale of the crisis. So, it is expected that such resistance will not be as strong as before,” a government official said.One reason to plan such institutional isolation is the reluctance among private hospitals to increase the number of Covid beds. The government has been asking the hospitals to have more beds for Covid patients.“We are in talks with private hospitals to augment infrastructure for Covid treatment,” retired judge Ashim Banerjee, the chairperson of West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, said.Some private hospitals have said they have more than 10 per cent beds for Covid patients. “We have the Covid wing in a separate building. But we can’t add more beds there and in the other building where non-Covid patients are treated, we cannot keep Covid patients,” the CEO of a private hospital said.Others said more Covid beds meant other patients would be more scared to visit the hospital for treatment.The Telegraph has written how the fear of getting infected by Covid-19 is keeping many patients away from hospitals.",2020-09-06 21:30:00
1330,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus pandemic: Stores in Calcutta malls seek rent relief - Telegraph India,"Malls in the city have reopened but many of their stores have not.Remaining shut for two months because of the lockdown has dealt a body blow to businesses, officials of such stores said. Many owners have cited the “unprecedented” slump while demanding that mall authorities waive the rents for April and May, according to the officials.Some have gone a step further, seeking a reduction in rent rates for now or pitching for a revenue-share model with the mall, according to managers and executives of such stores.Assuming it will take several months for business to bounce back, some stores are said to have demanded clear commitment from mall authorities to increase footfall in the coming days.A tour of South City Mall on Tuesday afternoon revealed multiple closed stores on every floor. They ranged from street fashion brands to sportswear. Marks and Spencer, Gas, Forever 21, Adidas, Reebok, Steve Madden and Calvin Klein were some of the closed stores at the mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road.An official of the mall said “30 per cent” of its stores were shut. The mall has close top 120 stores, he said.Tommy Hilfiger, Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Manyavar, Allen Solly, Levi’s and United Colors of Benetton were some brands with downed shutters at Quest Mall on Tuesday. An official said “70 per cent” of the stores were operational.The Park Circus mall has close to 130 stores, the official said.The Acropolis Mall in Kasba had at least six closed stores — The Body Shop, Marks and Spencer and Gini and Jony among them.“We did not have any business for more than two months. We are asking the mall authorities to waive the rent for the lockdown period and reduce the amount for the next few months,” the manager of a shut store in Quest Mall said.Many stores have asked malls to invest in promotional activities to attract buyers. They want the malls to share revenue if the rent amount is not reduced.An ethnic wear store in South City Mall has had not a single visitor since Monday, the store in-charge said. “We opened at 11am today but are still to receive our first visitor,” he told Metro around 1.30pm on Tuesday.Mall authorities and many store owners are still to reach a consensus on rent.An official of one of the malls in Calcutta said the retail stores were “forming associations and putting pressure by threatening not to open shops”. “We understand that they are facing financial problems but they cannot put a gun on our heads,” the official said.Several stores are shut for “logistics issues”, according to authorities of several malls. At least one apparel chain said the safety kits were still to arrive because of logistic issues. “The courier company said it did not have enough infrastructure,” an official of the chain said.Sanjeev Mehra, vice-president of Quest, refused to comment on individual stores. “With business partners, Quest Mall has been behaving very responsibly. The Covid-19 crisis is something that has never happened since Adam and Eve. There is a lot of stress on the retail sector. Some brands could be exiting, making way for new entries,” he said.The South City Mall authorities said a few stores had sought waiver of rents for the lockdown period. The mail is “awaiting the Supreme Court’s decision on a case pertaining to the moratorium on loans”.A petition has been filed in the apex court, challenging an RBI circular dated March 27, which had offered a moratorium on loans till May. It was later extended till August though there was no exemption in terms of accumulated interest components. On June 4, the top court sought the views of the finance ministry on the matter.“We are waiting for the Supreme Court’s decision on the moratorium case… it is expected later this month. We have not raised invoice to the stores for the entire lockdown period,” Manmohan Bagree, vice-president, South City, said. “Once the court order comes, we can amicably decide on the rent issue. Till then, we have requested the stores to function.”Sushil Mohta, the chairman of Merlin Group that owns Acropolis Mall, said several stores were shut because of “defective shutters and broken glass”.“Few stores have rent issues, which we will discuss and resolve. But some of them are putting pressure on us and we want them to leave. The malls have to pay bank interests. We have appealed to the Centre to waive bank interests for the time being,” Mohta said.",2020-09-06 21:32:00
1331,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus pandemic: Association can’t decide on fees: Bishop - Telegraph India,"The Church of North India (CNI) on Tuesday said the association of heads of Anglo Indian schools had no authority to decide fees or waivers and said the schools would withdraw their membership from the association in protest against its alleged interference.“The Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools in India, West Bengal Branch, is not authorised to deal with matters relating to the fee structure of their schools. This is solely decided by the board (of the respective schools), duly approved by the chairman (of the board),” Reverend Paritosh Canning, the bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI, wrote to The Telegraph on Tuesday. The bishop is the chairman of the governing boards of all CNI schools in Calcutta.He was reacting to a report in The Telegraph on Tuesday about a meeting of the association of Anglo Indian school heads that discussed possible waivers in school fees during the financial crisis triggered by the pandemic. “I am really shocked to note the contents thereof,” the bishop wrote, adding: “The association… has no authority to comment regarding waiver of any fee payable, by our schools, which are governed directly by the Bishop of Calcutta, CNI.”He added: “Our schools are hereby withdrawing their membership from the Association of Heads of Anglo -Indian Schools in India (AHAISI), West Bengal branch, with immediate effect....”Nine CNI schools are members of the association. They include the two La Martiniere schools, St James’, Pratt Memorial, four branches of St Thomas’ and St Paul’s Mission School. Heads of at least two of these schools were present at Monday’s meeting that discussed the financial crisis because of non-payment of fees.In a letter to the association, the bishop wrote: “The decision has been taken in view of your association's interference in the internal matters of our aforesaid schools.” After the bishop released his statement, the Bengal branch of the association said in a statement to The Telegraph that it had discussed at its meeting on Monday how to address the concerns of parents about payment of student fees but the members had not arrived at any decision on waiver.“The heading of the article – ‘Anglo Indian Schools offer relief on fees’ -– seems a bit misleading,” association president Father Rodney Borneo wrote on Tuesday. “Yesterday’s (Monday) meeting of the executive committee, Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools in India, West Bengal, did not take any decision regarding giving any sort of waiver of any sort of fees. This Association does not have the power to take such decisions that are the sole purview of the Boards of these schools. We did discuss ways in which the concern of the parents can be addressed in a logical way and the same was to be reported to our respective managements,” Father Borneo’s letter said.He added that “the only decision that was taken was that all efforts must be made to collect monthly tuition fees from our parents since without this source of revenue the schools will not be able to meet recurring expenditures like teachers’ salaries, etc”.Speaking to The  Telegraph later, Father Borneo said although no decision was taken regarding the waiver of annual fees, “it was unanimously proposed that we (the association) would recommend the governing boards of the schools to logically reduce some fees that are redundant in the present situation as the schools are closed”.",2020-09-06 21:34:00
1332,TT Bureau,Coronavirus pandemic: Main roads of Kolkata still off limits for cycles - Telegraph India,"Police have issued a notification allowing free movement of cycles in all roads and lanes in Calcutta except for “main arterial roads and flyovers”.Earlier, cycling during the day was prohibited in many of the city’s roads and lanes.The move came a day after the state cabinet approved a policy of allowing cycles on “all small and medium roads” on Monday to ease the hardship of people in reaching offices and other destinations in the absence of adequate public transport.“Calcutta police and other police commissionerates will issue a notification mentioning small and medium roads where cycles will be allowed. The decision has been taken considering that people are facing trouble to reach offices or workplaces in the absence of Metro,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said at Nabanna on Monday.Based on the directive, a notification was issued by the police on Tuesday.“For the sake of convenience of general public and in view of the restrictions imposed on public transport during the ongoing Corona pandemic… do hereby order that bicycles will be allowed in the lanes and bylanes within Calcutta Police jurisdiction. Restrictions will continue on the main arterial roads, flyovers and any other area as notified from time to time,” the notification signed by city police commissioner Anuj Sharma said.The notification reminded cyclists that they were not above traffic rules. “Cyclists should obey one-way restrictions and other traffic rules and regulations.”The order came into effect from Tuesday and will be in force till July 30.Cycling was completely restricted or limited between 11pm and 7am on 62 roads and flyovers in the city. According to the new rule, cycles will be free to move on these roads without any restriction, the police said.“There are many lanes in the city that run parallel to the thoroughfares. If people want to commute through these, they will not be stopped,” a traffic police officer said.Cycles will be allowed on thoroughfares only at crossings to reach a lane, the officer said.Several Calcuttans have started using cycles, mostly because there is not enough public transport to accommodate everyone going to office. Some have been peddling more than 20km to reach their offices in Calcutta to avoid the discomfort of travelling in an overcrowded bus in the absence of local trains.Traditionally, slow-moving vehicles like hand-pulled carts, rickshaws and cycles are banned on major roads because they reduce the speed of other vehicles, the police said.“Just because a cycle does not have a number plate and cannot be identified it does not mean a cyclist will not be prosecuted if found violating traffic rules,” a traffic police officer said.Allegations often emerge that the slow moving vehicles do not follow the traffic rules and often result into causing accidents when they illegally come out on the thoroughfares.By officially allowing cycles on the lanes and bylanes, the police would expect the bicyclists to be more cautious about the traffic rules.",2020-09-06 21:39:00
1333,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Many Covid zones in 2 boroughs of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Twenty-eight of the 39 containment zones in Calcutta are from two boroughs that cover parts of Kasba, Tiljala, Patuli, Mukundapur in the south and Ultadanga, Beleghata, Kankurgachhi and Phoolbagan in the northeast. In the latest list of containment zones published on Friday, boroughs  III and XII of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) each have 14 containment zones. A containment zone is created if at least four Covid-19 cases are reported from a small area in 14 days. In Borough XII, 13 of the 14 containment zones are from Ward 101 that covers parts of Baishnabghata-Patuli and Baghajatin. It alone has 163 active cases of the 231 active cases till Saturday. The other containment zone is a slum in Mukundapur’s Dinesh Nagar. In Borough III, five containment zones are from Ward 33 in Beleghata. Four of these containment zones are on Suren Sarkar Road and one, a housing complex near Kadapara market. The other zones include an apartment near Pantaloons store in Kankurgachhi, an apartment in Kankurgachhi Second Lane, a stretch near Miabagan slum on Beleghata Main Road and a stretch of Motilal Basak Lane in Phoolbagan. The list of containment zones is updated every three or four days. A Covid-19 patient, 54, tried to jump out of a third floor window of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on Saturday. A health worker spotted and rescued him.",2020-09-08 01:20:00
1334,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Diamonds on Facebook needn’t be best friend - Telegraph India,"A woman whose diamond-encrusted mangalsutra went missing from her home around two years ago spotted it on the Facebook profile of a former help whom she had suspected of having stolen it.Based on her family’s complaint on Friday, police have arrested the help and seized the mangalsutra and some other ornaments that had been missing from the woman’s home in Beleghata.Siddhartha Churiwal, who owns two flats on the third and fourth floors of a building on Dr Ashutosh Shastri Road in Beleghata, reported the matter to Beleghata police station on Friday.  “The complainant had brought two photographs. One was an old family photograph, which had his wife wearing the diamond-studded mangalsutra,” an officer of Beleghata police station said. “The other was a recent photograph of their former help Durga Hela who was wearing a similar-looking mangalsutra.”Churiwal told cops that some ornaments and Rs 50,000 went missing from their fourth-floor flat between December 2018 and July 2019. They had terminated Durga, 30, because they suspected her of theft but they did not file any complaint for want of evidence, the officer said.Durga’s husband Kamalesh, who, too, worked as the family’s help continued with his services as there was nothing to prove his complicity, the police quoted the family as saying in the complaint.A diamond-encrusted mangalsutra, three pairs of diamond earrings, some expensive saris, some silver plates, silver accessories and Rs 50,000 had gone missing from the Churiwal residence between December 2018 and July 2019, Churiwal has said in his complaint.Earlier this week, Churiwal’s wife spotted her help’s photograph on Facebook wearing a mangalsutra similar to her’s. The profile was in the name of “Anjali Hela”, the police said.Cops gathered the suspect’s address from her husband Kamalesh and raided their home at Lattupara on BB Ganguly Street later on Friday in the presence of a woman constable.Durga has apparently admitted to the crime. Cops have seized the mangalsutra and a pair of diamond earrings, an officer said.The case became easy to crack because the help’s address was available, another officer said.",2020-09-08 01:25:00
1335,Snehal Sengupta,"Target 10,000: New Town residents to adopt trees - Telegraph India","Residents of New Town will be able to adopt trees and nurture them with help from Hidco and the forest department as part of a drive to replant trees by the township’s authorities.The spots chosen for this are near housing complexes, a Hidco official said.The decision was taken after Hidco conducted a survey among residents to find out what they wanted to do as a community-driven activity with distancing norms. Planting trees and gardening topped the list.Hidco and the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) have requested residents’ associations in all three action areas to plant more trees inside housing complexes as well.The target is to plant 10,000 trees in New Town by the end of the year, Debashis Sen, the chairman-cum-managing director of Hidco, said.The trees that will be planted will be at least three years old and of varieties that are resilient to storms.More than 4,600 trees in the township were uprooted or damaged by Cyclone Amphan in May.New Town has palm, coconut, cherry blossom, pine and casuarina — all trees with supple trunks and branches — planted along its dividers. Hidco plans to plant more of these varieties among others.“Planting trees and gardening is therapeutic. All of us are cooped up in our homes because of the pandemic… planting trees and nurturing them will come as a welcome break. We will ensure distancing norms during the plantation and the trees adopted by residents will have a small name tag to help them identify the trees easily,” Sen said.To encourage residents to take part, Hidco will run a Facebook page chronicling the re-greening drive. Residents can post photographs of their trees on https://www.facebook.com/GreeningNewTown, Sen said. E-certificates will be given to those adopting trees.Hidco has requested government agencies, corporates and banks to replant trees in New Town.The state pollution control board will give 4,000 trees to the NKDA to be planted along roads in action areas I, II and III.An NGO has promised to plant 2,000 trees, the CRPF that has a camp in New Town and a private bank will undertake greening drives as well.The NKDA will plant trees on vacant plots in New Town and turn them into tree banks to prevent the growth of weeds and the spots from turning into garbage dumps.“There are a lot of plots where construction activities are still to start. We will plant trees that are more than two years old and can be replanted easily. Once construction starts, the trees will be replanted elsewhere,” an NKDA official said.",2020-09-08 01:28:00
1336,Debraj Mitra,"Gurdwara Behala, IHA Foundation and Kolkata Response Group's Langar on Wheels save the day - Telegraph India","The city was totally shut on Saturday and only a handful of vehicles were on the roads.Among them were two Boleros that criss-crossed the roads for most part of the day. The vehicles were stacked with cooked food for rickshaw-pullers, mutiyas (people who ferry load on vans or on their backs), workers at closed stalls and others whose livelihood has been hit by the pandemic.On Saturday, one of the car’s first stop was Howrah station. The driver parked it near the prepaid taxi bay in the old complex. The station was deserted. But scores of people soon flocked to the car. Volunteers of the IHA Foundation distributed the food — hot khichdi and a mishmash of vegetables — to the people who had gathered.One of them was Shyam Behari, a mutiya from Bihar’s Vaishali district. Behari had gone home in April. “But I don’t have land where I can work.Working at the station is better than working on someone else’s land. So, I came back in July,” he said.On other days, many of these people get some work. But on days of total shutdown, like Saturday, their earning is zero.Gurdwara Behala, IHA Foundation and Kolkata Response Group organised the drive, Langar on Wheels.“Lockdown restrictions are being relaxed but sources of income are still unreliable as of now, especially for daily-wage earners. On days of complete lockdown, they don’t have any source of food or water,” Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, the chairperson of the IHA Foundation and general secretary of Gurdwara Behala, said.What had started as a drive to feed the poor at gurdwaras during the lockdown gradually shifted to food being carried on wheels and distributed to the needy across the city and suburbs. After completing over 100 days of food delivery on the trot till July, the drive is back again to feed people on the days of complete lockdown in the state.The association has provided more than a million meals, according to the organisers.“We could cater to hundreds of people when we served food at gurdwaras. But the mobile food service reaches many more. The scale of the drive has gone up manyfold,” an organiser said.The poor and destitute could not always reach a gurdwara. So, the organisers engaged a task force and mobile units to deliver food to the needy.The food is cooked at a couple of kitchens in south Calcutta in the morning. The distribution starts from noon.On Saturday, one vehicle stopped in Howrah, Posta, the MG Road and Central Avenue areas and Shyambazar. Another vehicle headed stopped at Park Circus, Gariahat and Taratala among other places.The civic body and police are lending support to the drive.",2020-09-08 01:30:00
1337,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Covid test lab in Barasat hospital - Telegraph India,"The health department has decided to set up a laboratory at the district hospital in Barasat to increase the number of Covid tests in North 24-Parganas.  The district, which has reported the most number of cases after Calcutta, has been carrying out around 750 tests a day, the bulk of it being in three Calcutta hospitals — RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, School of Tropical Medicine and NRS Medical College and Hospital. Once the new laboratory is ready, health department officials said the aim would be to test at least 1,300 samples every day.“With a population of around 1.1 crore, North 24-Parganas has only one dedicated testing centre at the College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital in Kamarhati,” said a senior health department official. “Once we have a dedicated testing centre, samples won’t have to be sent to Calcutta.”North 24-Parganas, with several thickly populated pockets spread around parts of Barasat, Barrackpore, Titagarh, Naihati, Bongaon and Ashoknagar, has emerged as one of most critical districts skirting Calcutta. The number of Covid patients has steadily grown despite complete lockdown measures by the board of administrators of the Barasat and Madhyamgram municipalities. On Friday, North 24-Parganas added 89 cases taking the total count of “active cases” in the district to 5,611.The health department has already begun procuring RT-PCR machines so that laboratories in the districts, including one each at Suri, Tamluk and Jhargram, can carry out tests. Interviews for laboratory technicians are being carried out.“We have decided to take the total number of tests in the state to 25,000 every day in the next few days,” the health department official said.",2020-09-08 01:32:00
1338,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Season tips for parents of teenagers - Telegraph India,"Treat your teenagers as grown-ups; do not react differently to situations if you are in a foul mood and do not make excuses for the child if he/she cannot attend online classes.These are some of the advice schools and psychiatrists have for parents during the pandemic.Students are well-informed and parents should not give them “hollow reassurances” that the uncertain situation will soon be over but instead talk to them, according to psychiatrists.Parents are always the first teacher and now they need to be counsellors as well to tide over these unusual circumstances, several school heads have said. Children are upset to be at home and not being able to meet their friends and parents need to understand their situation and communicate with them.“The parent has to tell them that these are difficult times and one has to make use of whatever is available and feel grateful. Don’t say this pandemic will be fine and everything will be hunky dory. We don’t know that…. Don’t give hollow reassurances…. By doing so parents tend to underestimate the child’s ability to be discerning and they disconnect and feel they are not being understood,” psychiatrist Rima Mukherji told parents of students of Classes IX to XII at South Point High School on Friday.She was speaking at a session on Parents as Counsellors: Special Guidelines during the Pandemic.In several other schools, either counsellors or teachers are speaking to parents so that they can handle the situation more effectively at a time when they lose their patience easily because of stress.The heads of The Heritage School, Apeejay Schools and South Point High School feel children have to be treated as grown-ups who have a mind of their own and involve them in family decisions.“Parents treat children as they want to and according to their convenience. Instead they have to give children the confidence that their decision is valued. If they are given responsibilities they will never fail their parents,” Seema Sapru, principal of The Heritage School, said.The pandemic has thrown open many new challenges for parents.“Many parents make the mistake of brushing aside their children but these teens have a voice and if there is a crisis they can help out and give suggestions, which are pertinent,” Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharjee, principal, South Point, said.This is a time for parents to tell their children that they “are resilient, developing patience and coping skills” despite so many challenges, psychiatrist Mukherji said. “Don’t make excuses for the child that there was no Net connectivity or he/she was sick if he/she is not attending classes,” she said.Sri Sri Academy has been advising parents to use the time to “bond with children” and not to “over monitor” them as it can leave them frustrated.“Parents need to balance out the time they are spending with children… though they need to be watched and communication channels have to be kept open but parents should not over monitor,” principal Suvina Shunglu said.Parents are on the “front line”, spending time with them at a time when teachers are not present face to face, Mukherji said. “They have to attend online classes; they are anxious about their careers and how long this would continue… parents have a role to play and for that there has to be better self-awareness.”The role of the parent has expanded during the pandemic. “Parents are the first counsellors for their children but there are occasions when they might go wrong and hence they need the help of counsellors to guide them,” Reeta Chatterjee, administrator of the Apeejay Schools, said.Counsellors have to help parents with certain skills, the counsellor at Calcutta International School, Farishta Dastur Mukerji, said.",2020-09-08 01:35:00
1339,Monalisa Chaudhuri,"1,600 complaints bring Jharkhand town on police radar; SIM cards from Malda and Nadia - Telegraph India","More than 1,700 complaints have piled up in Lalbazar in the past two months. They are related to cheating or cheating attempts on the phone where callers posed as bank officials or restaurant managers.Close to 1,600 of these calls originated from Jamtara in Jharkhand with SIM cards from Malda, Nadia and pockets of South 24-Parganas, not far from Calcutta, police said.This is the first time cops have found a Bengal link with the Jamtara gang, which has been operating for years now, the police said.The total phone fraud amount in Calcutta in the past two months with a Jamtara connection is more than Rs 3 crore, an officer in Lalbazar said.The list of people cheated in June and July includes police officers and some of their elderly family members apart from lawyers, bank officials, IT personnel, teachers, homemakers, and retired people, the officer said.Youths, aged between 16 and 35 run the racket by calling up people at random and trying to persuade them into sharing bank details, the police said. Phone calls as well as WhatsApp calls are used in the fraud. The Jamtara gang has been trying everything, from offering bank loans to luring people with prize money from Kaun Banega Crorepati, to cheat people, the police said.“At times they pose as bank officials and tell people their debits cards are about to be blocked because they haven’t updated their KYCs… at time they offer bank loans or discounts on food items for home delivery,” an officer said.During lockdown, several people got into the business of home delivery of food. Many of them were cheated by members of the Jamtara gang who posed as customers and sought their bank details on the pretext of transferring money for food.“June recorded the highest number of complaints. The number was lower in July but it recorded the second-highest number of complaints related to Jamtara so far this year,” the officer said.Two men were arrested in Jamtara in July on the charge of cheating a north Calcutta resident of Rs 4.63 lakh. Investigations showed the SIM cards they used in their phones to make calls were from Bengal.It is not clear, though, how the cards reached Jamtara, the police said.“They transferred money through multiple accounts to sellers in Bengal for SIM cards. So many accounts make it difficult to track the money trail,” an officer said.Cops have been continuously trying to create awareness among people as well as take legal action against such frauds, Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma told Metro. “We request people not to share their bank or personal details with anyone over phone without properly confirming the caller’s identity.”The city police have arrested several youths from Jamtara in the past in connection with call centre rackets running in Calcutta.People of other states were cheated through these centres.Calling up people and cheating them is like a “full-time job” for many youths in Jamtara, a detective department officer who has visited Jamtara said.They usually use Truecaller before making calls to know the name of the person they are calling, an officer said. The modus operandi involves distributing the money from a fraud’s e-wallet to multiple e-wallets, the officer said.After several rounds, the money is transferred to bank accounts, which are opened with fake identity documents. The frauds withdraw the money from these accounts using ATM cards, the officer said.",2020-09-08 01:37:00
1340,Sanjay Mandal,"Private healthcare units can during admission demand up to Rs 50,000 - Telegraph India","Bengal’s regulatory commission has said private healthcare units in the state could during admission demand up to Rs 50,000 — or 20 per cent of the estimated treatment cost — whichever was less.The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission issued the related advisory on Saturday.The private hospitals cannot refuse admission if the patient cannot pay the sum immediately, but the money has to be paid within 12 hours, the advisory said.  If a patient fails to pay up within that time, the hospital can ask that the bed be vacated within the hour, it added.Patients’ rights groups said the decision gave private hospitals the “licence to fleece patients” and refuse treatment to those unable to pay.Retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairperson of the commission, said the amount had been fixed for the benefit of both the patients and the hospitals.“I have proof that one hospital had sought a deposit of Rs 3 lakh. This had to stop. At the same time, hospitals need to stay viable,” he said.But Peerless Hospital chief executive Sudipta Mitra said the hospital was asking for Rs 5,000 as deposit from Covid-19 patients during admission. “Now we can ask for Rs 50,000,” he said.Although the advisory did not mention Covid-19, most people seeking admission at hospitals now are either coronavirus-positive or have Covid-like symptoms.“After due deliberations and careful consideration, it is decided that clinical establishments would not be entitled to demand more than 20 per cent of the estimated cost of treatment or a maximum amount of Rs 50,000, whichever is less, at the time of admission,” the advisory issued by Arshad Hasan Warsi, secretary to the regulatory commission, said.The advisory said: “In case the patient party is not in a position to deposit the required amount at the time of admission, the hospital would admit the patient as and by way of provisional admission and give adequate necessary treatment required right at that moment. However, the admission would be regularised upon deposit of the amount within a period of 12 hours.”The advisory adds: “In case the deposit is not made within the time stipulated above, the hospital would be at liberty to cancel the provisional admission and ask the patient party to take back the patient within one hour thereafter.”According to the advisory, it had come to the notice of the commission that patient parties “face hardship in fulfilling requirement of advance payment” at the time of admission.Some of the private hospitals said it had become a headache to secure payment in the case of patients who had died or whose discharge date had arrived without anyone coming to accompany them home.In a second advisory issued on Saturday, the regulatory commission said: “All investigations amounting above Rs 2,000 should be done on a prior documented intimation to the patient party.”If an investigation is regularly repeated, it said, the patient's family must be informed and the reason explained.This advisory was issued because the commission had noticed that costly investigations were being repeated regularly, the commission said.Patients and organisations campaigning for their rights criticised the decision to allow the hospitals to seek up to Rs 50,000 as deposit.“The new advisory gives private hospitals the licence to fleece patients and refuse treatment,” said Kunal Saha, president, People for Better Treatment.“Most Covid-19 patients need (only) monitoring and basic support because they have moderate to mild symptoms. This (advisory) will also make people with critical patients reluctant to go to a (private) hospital.”Hospitals welcomed the advisory. “Different hospitals were demanding different amounts as deposit. Now there will be a uniform rate. This will prevent misunderstandings,” said Rupak Barua, president, Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, an organisation of private hospitals in Bengal.",2020-09-08 02:52:00
1341,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: IIM Calcutta to bring batch back post Net glitch - Telegraph India,"IIM Calcutta will call students of the executive MBA course to the campus so they can use the Internet network there and take part in online classes without disruption, said an official of the institute.The residential programme was launched in an online mode in April amid the pandemic, but many of the students, who paid Rs 27 lakh for the one-year course, often found it difficult to connect from home because of poor connectivity and were dissatisfied with what the institute had to offer, said sources.The 62 students of the class will be brought to the Joka B-school in batches so they can attend the classes taking advantage of the seamless network on the campus, the official told The Telegraph.“IIM Calcutta’s one-year full-time MBAEx students are all set for the maiden on-campus experience starting September…. The students will arrive on the campus in small batches to undertake quarantine in the campus hostel, while still attending classes online,” a statement issued by the institute said.Six working professionals who had enrolled for the programme and paid Rs 2 lakh each as commitment fee took a refund in late July saying they did not wish to continue in the current atmosphere of “financial uncertainty”.They also alleged that the programme had been converted into the online mode without consulting the students.Director Seth said in a statement mailed to The Telegraph: “What makes such programmes unique is the experiential learning, networking and bond built amongst batchmates. It’s so unfortunate that this year’s batch of 62 students has already been deprived of this opportunity for the first four months of their programme due to the Covid pandemic that required them to take online classes from home, many under very difficult circumstances, including serious connectivity issues. We are now at least able to offer them an option to be at campus to attend classes online as a respite.”A teacher of the institute said students of the two year-MBA programme might renew their demand to be brought back to the campus so they could use the institute’s network facility and attend classes without any glitch. “If that happens it could mean an assembly on the campus, which would not be advisable amid the pandemic,’’ he added.The statement issued by the IIM says the students were “facing serious difficulties with extension of rent leases and other constraints” while attending online classes over the past four months.When asked what they meant by difficulties in rent leases, an official said: “Many students were forced to take rooms on rent in locations that ensured better connectivity following poor network in home. This was posing serious difficulty as the course is already steeply charged.”",2020-09-09 01:53:00
1342,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Unlock 4: UK board to conduct exams in November - Telegraph India,"Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE), a UK-based school board, has decided to go ahead with its pen-and paper November 2020 exams but given the schools the option to withdraw candidates as close as a day before the exams start, unlike other years.The exams of the November 2020 series will be held in October and November.The schools can withdraw candidates depending on the Covid-19 situation and if they do not have the necessary permission from the government authorities to let their students take the test.The board conducts the exams thrice a year — in June, October-November and March. Some international schools in the city allow their students to write the exams in any of the three series. This year the exams could not be held in June because of the pandemic.Some international schools in the city are proceeding with the arrangements to conduct the exams but said the final call would be taken on the basis of what the government would say.“We are running exams for the November 2020 series where schools believe it is safe and where they have the necessary permissions from the government authorities. We believe exams remain the fairest and most reliable way to assess student achievement and our schools are telling us they want to hold exams if they can,” the CAIE has said.The schools have been allowed to withdraw their students by September 30. In some schools, the exams begin on October 1.“What is unique about this session is that the board is allowing withdrawal of candidates so close to the exam. In our institution it is as close as four days. The special provision will  address the concerns of students and guardians in this difficult time,” said Sarojesh Mukerjee, the director of The Cambridge School in south Calcutta.“We are proceeding towards the board exams in October-November... but nothing will come above the safety of our students,” said Anuradha Das, the director of Garden High International School.“The number of students for the exam in October-November is limited and not all of them appear now. In fact all the students do not have papers on the same day so it will be easy for us to maintain social distancing if the government gives us the go ahead to conduct exams,” said Saswati Datta, the principal of Vidyanjali International School.Calcutta International School, The Heritage School, Bridge International School and Vidyanjali International School are some of the other schools that offer the curriculum.",2020-09-09 01:54:00
1343,Our Special Correspondent,Kolkata weather update: Rain respite from heat and humidity - Telegraph India,"A spell of heavy rain on Tuesday afternoon brought temporary relief from the heat and humidity that Calcuttans had been subjected to for the past few days.A shell of thunderclouds that descended from the western districts of Bengal led to the rain that started around 4pm. The Met office recorded around 60mm of rain in Alipore.Patuli was the wettest area in the city, recording more than 70mm of rain, according to data collected from the water pumping stations of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Places in south Calcutta got more rain than the north. Joka received around 50mm and New Market 35mm.Traffic crawled on several roads because of the rain. Diamond Harbour Road and Rashbehari Avenue had heavy traffic around 8pm, much after the rain had stopped.The mercury hovered around 34 degrees Celsius for several days at a stretch. The minimum relative humidity, a measure of the moisture content in the air during the driest part of the day, was consistently on the higher side for the past few days.The rain was accompanied by a series of lightning on Tuesday.“The pent-up heat and humidity led to the formation of the thunderclouds,” a Met official said.The Met office has forecast thunderstorms in the coming days as well.",2020-09-09 01:55:00
1344,"Mita Mukherjee, Tapas Ghosh",Coronavirus outbreak: Calcutta High Court urges parents  to stop fee protest - Telegraph India,"The high court on Tuesday expressed hope that parents would “desist” from agitations in front of school gates while it hears their plea for a fee waiver during the Covid pandemic and said the institutions could seek police action if such demonstrations broke out.“It is hoped that the parents desist from carrying out any agitation at the school gates, particularly since the matter is being considered by the court. Any report of further agitation at the school gates may be reported by the relevant schools for appropriate police action,” the bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Mousumi Bhattacharya said.The bench, while hearing a PIL, proposed that the 145 schools involved in the case set up committees comprising teacher and guardian representatives to identify the parents who were genuinely unable to pay the fees because of financial trouble during the pandemic.“It will be open to all schools to consider such instances on a case-to-case basis without there being any generic direction in such regard. However, as far as the extent of (fee) reduction allowable, there have to be voluntary suggestions made by the individual committees of each school which are proposed to be set up by the order that may be passed when the matter is taken up next,” the order said.“It is heartening to note that almost without exception schools which have participated in today’s hearing have said that they have entertained, on a case-to-case basis, appeals by the parents of the students who have been financially hit.”The bench said the six CNI schools which had moved the Supreme Court against the high court order seeking income and expenditure details of the schools would have to apply to the high court by September 14 for recall/modification of its order. The apex court had asked the schools to move the high court for the recall/modification of the order.The six schools are seeking recall/modification because minority schools enjoy financial autonomy. Article 30 of the Constitution guarantees the freedom to minority schools, a CNI official said.Social activist Vineet Ruia had moved a PIL in the high court alleging that many private schools were not allowing students to attend online classes or take online exams for failing to pay fees. The petition had also alleged that the school authorities had been demanding charges on various heads though they had not provided those services during the pandemic.Agitations by parents have been common during the pandemic. They have been demanding reduction of tuition fees and waiver of fees under heads like sports, computer and library — the facilities students had not been availing of as the schools are shut.The schools, which take no aid from the government, have said they would find it difficult to pay wages and maintain infrastructure if parents do not pay.The high court on Tuesday said the two-member committee it had constituted to go into the schools’ income and expenditure “indicates several fallacies in the accounts submitted by the schools”. In a preliminary report, the panel has said collecting fees on 30 heads such as “art and craft expenses”, “textbook charges”, “band charges” and “entertainment expenses” during this period was “unjustified”.The court said the heads referred to in the report should be addressed and individual schools should justify the amount they have claimed to have spent under various heads.",2020-09-09 01:56:00
1345,Subhankar Chowdhury,Form fill-in starts for Jadavpur University final semester exams - Telegraph India,"The graduating students of arts and science at Jadavpur University have started filling in forms online to write their end-semester exams, which are likely to be held from October 1 to 10.The university on Tuesday issued a notification announcing the start of the form fill-in exercise and said the results published in July, following the state higher education department’s June 27 directive, “stand cancelled” in accordance with a Supreme Court order.The July results were prepared based on internal assessment and performance in previous semesters. The Supreme Court had on August 28 upheld the UGC’s July 6 directive that said graduating students would have to write their exams and could not be assessed on the basis of their performance in previous semesters.“Fresh examinations for the said semesters will be held as per university examination rules and resolutions adopted in the matter by the examination committee,” the JU notice reads.The graduating students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels have till Friday to fill-in and submit examination forms.“The exams are likely to be held from October 1 to 10. We will announce the dates after the state government gets the UGC’s approval for conducting the tests after September 30,” said a JU official.The UGC had in its July 6 order set September 30 as the deadline for completing the final year/terminal exams. The Supreme Court says that if any state or Union Territory, in exercise of the jurisdiction of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, decides that it is not possible to conduct the exams by September 30, it can apply to the UGC for an extension of the deadline.“Let the Bengal government, which has announced that exams in state-aided universities would be held from October 1 to 18, first get the approval. After that we will announce the dates,” the JU official said.Questions papers will be sent to students through digital mode such as group email or WhatsApp half an hour before each day’s test starts. Scanned copies of the answer scripts have to be sent through email or WhatsApp.How will students without smartphones or data packs or those with poor Net connections at home will write the exams?“The university will deliver question papers to and collect answer scripts from the homes of the students who lack a smart device or Internet connectivity. No one will be left out for want of a device or connectivity,’’ said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.",2020-09-09 01:57:00
1346,Snehal Sengupta,Rush and potholes trigger snarls near Calcutta airport - Telegraph India,"Vehicles crawled on Belghoria Expressway, Jessore Road and the airport’s slip road on Tuesday, a day after the total lockdown, because of a heavy rush and innumerable potholes on the roads.Vehicles, including two-wheelers, headed to the city from Barasat, Dakshineswar, and Madhyamgram via Jessore Road or going to these places were caught in the jam that added at least 90 minutes to their travel time.Near the airport, a combination of craters, construction materials lying by the roadside and crash barriers triggered traffic snarls during the morning and evening rush hour.Motorists and two-wheeler riders headed towards Belghoria Expressway as well as to the city from the expressway face snarls almost every day because of potholes on Jessore Road. Trucks and other heavy vehicles add to the problem.Sandipan Chakraborty, a resident of Barasat who was headed to the city, said it took him more than an hour from the airport’s Gate No. 2.5 to reach the flyover that connects Ultadanga to the Bypass.The distance from the airport to the flyover is around 9.7km and it takes around 25 minutes on other days to cover the stretch, he said.Cops had requested the agencies maintaining VIP Road and Jessore Road to repair them, anofficer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate’s airport traffic guard said.“We requested them to do patchwork repairs… they have done that on some stretches. There was a huge rush of vehicles today (Tuesday) and coupled with the potholes there were snarls despite our best efforts,” the officer said.Jessore Road is in bad shape though it has been widened. The police deployment at the airport’s Gate No. 2.5 and No. 1 is sufficient but there is little effort to regulate traffic, according to regular commuters.“They just stand there and wave at vehicles. Is that traffic management?” Triparna Sinha, who lives in a complex along Jessore Road, asked.The T-junction at Gate No. 2.5 chokes as soon as there is a heavy rush of vehicles, Sinha said. Many people now enter the airport complex through the flyover instead of going through the chaos on the slip road.They take the road in front of Airport police station to reach Gate No. 2.5 from the opposite end and add to the congestion there. The police and civic volunteers, at least six on each shift, stand and watch, another regular commuter said.The lack of police intervention at the junction where traffic lands on Jessore Road from Belghoria Expressway via the flyover is another reason behind the snarls.The public works department maintains VIP Road and Jessore Road near the airport.A PWD engineer said the agency had done patchwork repairs multiple times on these roads.“We even did patchwork repairs on Jessore Road on Monday as there were no vehicles because of the total lockdown. But a combination of rain and heavy vehicles on these roads damage the repairs. We will again repair the stretches where potholes have reappeared,” the engineer said.Both roads need to be resurfaced and patchwork repairs are a temporary fix that will not last long, the engineer said. “We are planning thorough repairs on VIP Road and Jessore Road before the puja.”",2020-09-09 01:59:00
1347,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Woman trafficked with job offer rescued in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A 20-year-old woman from North 24-Parganas who was struggling to make ends meet because of the Covid-19 crisis was allegedly trafficked to Bihar in June.The woman left home after being allegedly abused by her husband, a daily wage-earner put out of work by the pandemic. A family member said she was allegedly trafficked by another woman who lured her with the offer of a job. She was taken to Bihar’s Siwan where she was allegedly forced to join a dance troupe before being rescued on July 15.The incident is a pointer to how the Covid-19 pandemic has landed many families in abject poverty, making women and minor girls more vulnerable to trafficking, said rights activists. The penury caused by the pandemic has made the lure of a job almost irresistible. Traffickers are on the prowl, looking for such vulnerable girls to force them into prostitution.“She was lured by a racket that used to hire women for the troupe. The victim said she was asked to perform dance and have sex with clients. On refusal, she would be physically tortured by the owner of the troupe,” said an official of International Justice Mission, which facilitated an operation that led to her rescue.“The survivor recorded her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC in front of a magistrate at a court in Bongaon, in North 24-Parganas, on August 28,” said an officer of Bongaon police station.Metro has reported how the pandemic has led to a spurt in child marriages and increased the trafficking threat. Many parents who have lost their livelihoods are ready to marry off their daughters to any groom who does not demand a dowry. The grooms are often linked to trafficking rackets.A group of 21 minors from Bihar’s Samastipur, all alleged victims of trafficking, was rescued from a bus in Calcutta early on Monday. Police said the children were being taken to Howrah to work in bangle factories.The Bongaon woman was not a minor but was in deep poverty. “She found it difficult to make ends meet after her husband lost his job. He used to drink every day and beat her,” the survivor’s elder sister told this newspaper over the phone.“A woman my sister knew offered her a job. On the day of the journey, she was accompanied by that woman and two men. They gave my sister a spiked drink and took her to Bihar in a car as trains were not running,” the survivor’s sister said.She said she could not remember which day her sister went missing but it “was early in June”.The survivor could call her family from Siwan from the phone of another member of the troupe. Her father lodged a missing complaint on July 4.“The number that the survivor called from helped us trace the location of the group,” said an official of Mission Mukti Foundation. Volunteers of the organisation had accompanied Bihar police during the rescue.“The challenge will be to curb traffickers when train services resume,” said an activist of Partners in Anti-Trafficking, an alliance of organisations.",2020-09-09 02:00:00
1348,Our Special Correspondent,Jamtara phone cheats arrested - Telegraph India,"Seven people were arrested in Jamtara, Jharkhand, in the past two days in connection with bank frauds on the phone.The arrests were made based on the complaints of two Calcuttans who had lost close to Rs10 lakh during the lockdown. They had shared their bank details with callers on the phone who posed as bank officials, police said.These men usually call up people in Calcutta posing as bank or income tax department officials and persuade such people into sharing their bank details with them, the police said. Once they get hold of the bank details, they transfer money from a victim’s account to multiple e-wallets.In June, Pratyusha Sinha Basu Mullick, who lives in the Sanjeeva Town Bungalow Complex in the Calcutta Leather Complex area, had reported how she had lost Rs 6 lakh to a caller who had fraudulently obtained her banking details and the one-time-password generated on her phone.The next month, Ruma Majumdar, a resident of East Bishnupur in North 24-Parganas had reported that Rs 4.63lakh had been withdrawn from her account in the Shyambazar branch of a nationalised bank.“Both complainants had reported the matter to us as soon as the crime had been committed. So, we were able to block and retain a part of the transferred money,” an officer of the detective department’s anti-bank fraud section said.As part of the modus operandi, the gang members used to call up people; at times posing as bank officials and telling them that their debit cards were about to be blocked or their e-commerce accounts were about to be invalidated for want of KYC. Some even told people that they had won prizes in reality shows and their bank details were needed to get them the prize money.The money was transferred from the victim’s bank account to multiple e-wallets to minimise the chance of the money trail getting identified, the police said.The Telegraph had on August 9 reported how Lalbazar had been flooded with more than 1,700 complaints of bank fraud, amounting to more than Rs3 crore. Of that at least 1,600 were connected to Jamtara. In several cases, cops found that the phone numbers that had been used to contact the complainants had SIM cards bought from Bengal.“That was the first time we found a direct link between the Jamtara gang and Bengal. SIM cards had been bought from Malda, Nadia and pockets of South 24-Parganas close to Calcutta,” an officer said.The number of complaints in June and July had shot up as a several people, especially the elderly, who were otherwise uncomfortable with online transactions had to go online to clear various dues during the lockdown, the police said.The city police have been running a helpline (8585063104) for people to report bank frauds on the phone.",2020-09-09 02:02:00

Their school extended a helping hand to keep their dreams alive.Khelaghar, a community school run by an NGO, Young Men’s Welfare Society, has taken the initiative to help more than 1,700 families, including those of their students and others associated with the school, to survive during the pandemic and in the aftermath of Amphan.“We work in 46 villages of South 24-Parganas where thousands of families lost their homes and crops to Amphan and the flood caused by the breach of embankments. Most don’t have any work because of the pandemic,” Shazia Begum, the NGO’s rural secretary, said. “We reach out to around 7,000 individuals every day as part of the relief and rehabilitation project.”Khelaghar has branches in Raghunathpur, Joynagar and Bhagabatipur in South 24-Parganas. The three branches combined have 1,700 students.The school has organised relief camps in these areas and distributed basic food items such as rice, pulses, wholemeal flour, potatoes and oil, and non-food essentials such as masks and sanitisers. The school has supplied people with asbestos among others that is needed to rebuild their homes.“We have been getting dry rations regularly from the school. It’s crucial for our survival,” Sraboni Chakraborty, Sree’s mother, said.Sree is a KG II student of Khelaghar, Bhagabatipur.Khelaghar has cared for everyone associated with the school, be it cooks, gardeners or van-pullers. “I couldn’t earn anything because of the lockdown; my house, too, was damaged by Amphan. Khelaghar helped me with dry rations and gave me five asbestos sheets to rebuild my home,” Gopal Halder, a van-puller who used to ferry children from villages to Khelaghar before the pandemic, said.The NGO provides pre-primary and primary education to underprivileged children aged between three and nine. “Our aim is to make the learning experience more enjoyable and relevant. A clean and bright ambience, innovative teaching-learning methods and a caring team of teachers are the most important elements of our school,” Sangeeta Mukerji, trustee of Young Men’s Welfare Society, said.The NGO turns 50 this year.Khelaghar has ensured that the kids continue with their studies. Teachers have been sending tutorial videos to parents or those with smartphones so that the kids can go through the videos. If students do not have access to smartphones, teachers assign them homework in exercise books through their parents. “My daughter is getting restless as she is unable to go to Khelaghar. Thanks to the tutorial videos sent by the school, she can at least continue with her studies,” Mallika Gayen, Lovely’s mother, said.Lovely is a Class III student of the school.Anushree, Sree, Lovely, and Priti — all are desperate to return to Khelaghar, the place they love to be at.“I want to go to school. I like the ambience, the teachers and everything about our school,” Priti, a Class III student, said.",2020-09-09 02:04:00
1351,"Monalisa Chaudhuri, Kinsuk Basu ",‘Assault’ car suspect arrested in Dum Dum - Telegraph India,"Abhishek Kumar Pandey, accused of assaulting and throwing out a woman from his Honda City and running over another woman while trying to flee on Saturday night, has been arrested in Dum Dum, police said on Tuesday night.Investigators said his mobile phone was switched off but the GPRS on his phone was working. His movement was tracked first to a guest house in the Anandapur area and then in the Sealdah home of a lawyer, after which he had switched off the GPRS.On Tuesday night, cops could again track him to a place near Dum Dum from where he was arrested.Pandey will be produced in court on Wednesday, the police said.He was apparently in a guest house in Mukundapur, around 4km from Anandapur police station, on Sunday night when the crime he has been accused of was being telecast on TV.The only difference: the suspect in the TV news was named as Amitabha Bose.The Telegraph on Tuesday spoke to the owner of the guest house where Pandey had apparently holed up for almost nine hours. The owner, Soumik Pandey, said he never suspected him as he was a regular at the guest house and that news on TV had said cops were looking for Amitabha Bose.“He checked in around 8pm on Sunday and went to a room upstairs. Around 5am, he checked out. My manager told me that one of his little fingers had a cut mark. I don’t remember which hand,” Soumik Pandey said. “His Honda City was parked outside. I recognised it was his car; but had no clue that cops were looking for him. I always thought it was some Amitabha Bose.”Close to midnight on Saturday, Abhishek Pandey had thrown a woman out of his Honda City near Abhyudoy Housing Society and left another woman with a fractured leg and gash in the head when he tried to flee, police said.“The car is registered in the name of Dewendra Kumar Pandey. It was registered in January 2017,” an officer of Anandapur police station said. “The car’s insurance is valid till December 2020.”On Saturday night, the two had driven around parts of the Bypass after having dinner at a restaurant in Patuli. From the Bypass, the two went to Ajoynagar, Garia, Kalikapur, and then to Anandapur, the police said.“Abhishek Pandey has been to my guest house in the past. I know him for more than a year. He would at times come and stay alone, too,” Soumik Pandey said. “If only I knew it was him the cops were looking for that night I would have immediately alerted them. Amitabha Bose naam tai confuse korey dilo (The name Amitabha Bose caused confusion).”He didn’t order for dinner that night. “Khub honto-donto hoye eshechhilo (He had reached in a huff). He just asked one of the service boys to switch on the TV in his room. He said he wanted news channels,” the owner of the guest house said.The police have collected details of Pandey’s address and identity proof from the guest house register. Officers have scanned CCTV footage to see him enter and leave the guest house.So why didn’t they get to know of his whereabouts earlier?“The name the victim had initially said in her complaint had left us bewildered,” an officer said. “We kept groping in the dark for some time till the real identity emerged.”",2020-09-09 02:10:00

1353,Upala Sen,Cycle-rickshaws in Calcutta: Tricked onto a shaky rick - Telegraph India,"I cannot remember any more how the idea struck him, but one fine day he said — “You have to take a rickshaw ride when I am in town.” That was it. Thereafter, every once in a while, even in the middle of dead-serious conversations, he would just erupt with excitement and say — You have to...In retrospect I wonder why I didn’t ask that first moment — “Why rickshaw?” Perhaps I understood his thirst for a good spectacle. And in his mind, me on a hand-pulled rickshaw would be one. Yes, he wanted to be witness.It didn’t occur to me to tell him that in the small town where I grew up, a rickshaw was no novelty. Of course, those would be the cycle-rickshaws. I remember believing as a toddler that all one had to do was stand at the gate of my grandmother’s house after a rigorous bath and a generous smattering of talc and wave one’s hand and a rickshaw would appear from somewhere.Many of these cycle-rickshaws would ferry children to school. Some enterprising charioteers would add a wooden bench to the footboard to accommodate extra passengers. I recall a rickshawwala who wore a kanthi around his neck and called every little girl Pushpa and pretend to poke in the ribs. They called him katukutu buro or the tickle man. I found it disconcerting then, and disturbing even in retrospect.I remember the ride from Bandel station and how the rickshaw would clatter and tremble as it sped through the tunnel. As I clutched on to one side, I was sure when it ended I would find my teeth had come loose. I had several teeth missing for a long time and the prospect wasn’t thrilling.In any case, he came, he went, came and went back. I did not remember the rickshaw ride. He too forgot but accused me later.“Next time,” he threatened on FaceTime. I nodded demurely.I understood the feeling. When H was in kindergarten and myself in Class VII, I was possessed by this burning need to teach her indices. One evening, when the parents were away someplace, I made her forfeit her playtime and sit on a high chair with my O.P. Sinhal open in front of her. Did I actually think she who did not even know her numbers could begin to comprehend the rules of algebra? I don’t think so. It was about the moment with all its impossibilities that was so delectable.Did I imagine he would forget the rickshaw ride? No. I didn’t think about it all. My last address in the other city had required me to take a rickshaw ride twice a day for close to 10 years. Come to think of it, another tunnel, dark and skiddy. In the monsoons, water would come up to the footboard. Some months before I left town for good, they inaugurated a parallel smart-tunnel, complete with orange lights and a smart incline that would not allow water to accumulate. I knew then that my time there was up.Of course, there was no way he could know all this; if he did, perhaps he would understand my rickshaw-indifference.The moment arrived quietly, a normal in sheep’s clothing. He was visiting and had a few hours to spare. He proposed to spend them walking around the most crowded part of the city, before lunching at a pice hotel. When he achieved both, I should have known the cosmic forces were with him.With some time on his hands, he decided to walk more, stopped at nearly every bookshop in boi para, made an impromptu stop at Coffee House, darted out when he had had his fill of it and walked some more. It was all at such feverish pace that you would think all this were an illusion and were it not lived immediately and to the fullest it would all disappear in seconds.I was quite happy with my own pace when he suddenly hollered, “Rickshaw.” The merry band echoed, “Rickshaw.” The next thing I knew, a bargain had been struck and I was suddenly being foisted into one of those hand-pulled things I so dreaded for myself and for the carrier. It was not enough, there was also some photography happening on the side. I would have normally made some conversation with the puller, but that day I was much too acutely aware of my spectacle-hood.There he was feet firmly on the ground, pulling away, and there I was, looking above, inert, a mountain of embarrassment.When I disembarked just before we turned the corner at the Tropical School of Medicine, I felt not a little relieved. I could now just hop onto a yellow taxi and reach wherever I had to. I am not sure what made me turn around, but when I did, there was the depleted but still very merry band walking towards me. Without a pause or a breath lost he said, “Now you have to write about it,” and pushed ahead.",2020-09-13 00:58:00
1354,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Kolkata traffic snarls return to haunt commuters - Telegraph India,"Traffic snarls have returned to Calcutta though schools and colleges are shut and many Calcuttans are still working from home.But those whose offices have reopened and who are commuting daily have told Metro how difficult their trips have become. Some of their complaints are:Pramit Sarkar, who travels from Tollygunge to his Poddar Court office daily, said he was getting “unusually late” on SP Mukherjee Road. The maximum congestion is near Hazra crossing between 11am and noon, he said. “At times it feels the traffic signals are not working… the signal seems to be stuck at red.”A professional said he was recently stuck in a traffic snarl on SP Mukherjee Road in the afternoon and by the time he reached the Exide crossing, vehicles were being diverted through the next crossing off Birla Planetarium. “Further ahead, my vehicle was diverted through the Air India crossing. All through I did not see any cop on the road,” he said.Debraj Chatterjee, who has been working from his Behala home, had stepped out earlier this week for an official assignment and could cross Durgapur Bridge to reach Alipore in 40 minutes in the afternoon, a journey that usually takes 15 minutes.Many people said they often got stuck on the Parama flyover no matter what time of the day.Some motorists wondered if the number of cars had gone up because people were reluctant to use public transport. Every time there is a jam, the police blame something or the other: a car that has broken down, a waterlogged pocket, or slow traffic because of rain, they said.
Is there a larger problem because traffic jams are so widespread? There have been no reports of any signal malfunctioning, the police said.“The traffic signal cycle had been reduced considerably in the initial days of the lockdown.Now, it has been reversed to the normal timings,” a traffic police officer said. “Maybe commuters have got into the habit of waiting for short periods at traffic signals and now they are taking time to readjust.”Senior officers refuted the allegation that traffic cops were few on the roads during the pandemic.There are close to 3,000 traffic cops. They are assisted by 1,000 home guards and 2,000 civic volunteers, according to officers in Lalbazar.At least 37 traffic cops are in hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus and 15 are in home quarantine as on Thursday. Earlier, 216 traffic cops had tested positive for the virus; but they have recovered and resumed duty, the police said.Cops attributed the bumper-to-bumper jam on the Parama flyover to multiple vehicles breaking down on the flyover every day.Less than a week is left for Mahalaya. Every year during this time, traffic snarls are common as more and more people step out of their homes to shop. Vehicles are parked indiscriminately, pedestrians spill on to roads, there’s intermittent rain and waterlogging.But this year is different because of the pandemic. Buses are few and shoppers or pedestrians are almost negligible. So, motorists and two-wheeler riders are surprised to find traffic snarls.“Waterlogging on a small stretch on Central Avenue cannot be a reason for a 5km-long snarl… the tail of vehicles from MG Road reaching almost the Park Street flyover,” said a professional who was recently caught in a snarl on the Park Street flyover for 45 minutes on her way to office at Esplanade.“Unlike other years, there are no pedestrians who usually slow down the traffic. The volume of vehicles may have increased but that is why we have traffic cops.”",2020-09-13 02:07:00
1355,Subhankar Chowdhury,Jadavpur University readies phone-and-link plan for students to overcome digital divide - Telegraph India,"A Jadavpur University committee has decided that 110-odd students will be given smartphones and free Internet connectivity and around 300 more will be provided data packs to ensure that none misses out on digital education and exams, an official said on Saturday.The committee, having teachers and administrative officials, was formed on September 4 to “help students with digital devices and connectivity”. The members met on Thursday and decided to provide close to 500 students, selected through a survey that considered their economic condition and other hindrances, with phones and Net connectivity.The official, who is a member of the committee, said students have been selected from all three streams — science, arts and engineering.The smartphones are priced between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 each. “Those who will require connectivity support have been asked to share the details of their network service provider. We will have their packs recharged from the university for three months as of now,” saidGour Krishna Pattanayak, the university’s finance officer and a member of the committee.
Another JU official said the period of three months had been stipulated as of now because the new semester, scheduled to begin later this month, would be for that duration. If need be, the arrangement will be continued, he added.“Since the third week of August, a corpus of over Rs 16 lakh has been raised. It will not be difficult for us to continue providing support,” the official said.“But if a student does not have a smartphone or is hindered by poor connectivity in the absence of a data pack, they will not be able to take part in the distance digital mode education. That’s why the support is being provided,” said Partha Pratim Roy, the general secretary of the Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association and a member of the committee.  Similar support will be provided to students who are to write the end-semester exams in arts and science that are scheduled to be held between October 1 and 10.JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das had in the third week of August requested teachers and other employees to donate a day’s salary to help students overcome the digital divide. He had also appealed to alumni, guardians and anyone else who wishes to pitch in for the cause.The new semester for arts and science students through “distance digital mode” will start from September 14, while that of engineering from September 25.The official said a section was being created on the JU website where course materials and audios and videos of lectures would be uploaded. Teachers will share with the students the links of the files in Word or PDF format, audio notes and video recordings.",2020-09-13 02:22:00
1356,Sanjay Mandal,Two siblings donate organs to save their brother's life - Telegraph India,"A man from Mizoram underwent two simultaneous organ transplants at a hospital in Calcutta, thanks to his two siblings who donated a kidney and liver.Lalrinngheta from Lunglawn, Lunglei, in Mizoram, about 170km from Aizawl, said he could not be thankful enough to his brother Lalrinpuia who donated his kidney and sister Laleinawmni who donated her liver to save his life.Lalrinngheta said he had diabetes for a long time and that he had visited Calcutta in December last year for treatment at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences at Mukundapur when doctors said he would need a kidney transplant. His brother Lalrinpuia, a schoolteacher, volunteered to donate his kidney.In February, Lalrinngheta was told by doctors his liver, too, was damaged and that he needed a transplant.Lalrinngheta, a government employee, said he had long been suffering from diabetes and that damaged his organs.“We got to know of our brother’s crisis and I decided to donate the kidney. Then when we got to know he needed a liver transplant, we did not know what to do,” Lalrinpuia, who donated a kidney, said on Saturday. “One of our two sisters, Laleinawmni, decided to donate a portion of her liver.”The surgery could not take place because of the lockdown and the brothers and sister and other family members have been staying at a rented apartment off the Bypass since December.On Thursday, Lalrinngheta underwent simultaneous liver and kidney transplants. Doctors said the brothers and the sister were stable.“I was suffering from diabetes for long and after doctors told me I needed kidney and liver transplants I thought I was not going to survive. But my brother and sister came forward and the only thing I can offer them is love,” Lalrinngheta said from his hospital bed on Saturday. “I cannot repay their debts.”“Our brother has two sons, aged seven and nine. He needed our help and we donated our organs,” Lalringpuia, the brother who donated the kidney, said. “We are a close knit family and this was our duty.”Doctors said the surgery was complicated.“When the liver transplant was taking place, it was an almost 12-hour surgery. During that time, the kidneys were not working. After the liver was transplanted into him, the kidney was put in place,” Sanjay Goja, senior consultant and programme director of liver transplant at RN Tagore hospital said.He is out of the ICU, Goja said.“It was an uphill task because the kidneys and the liver were not functioning. But we hope to discharge him in a week,” D.S. Ray, who headed the team that performed the kidney transplant, said.",2020-09-13 03:33:00
1357,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Kolkata schoolteacher cheated on phone - Telegraph India,"A schoolteacher was coaxed into sharing her and her daughter’s banking details with a person who identified himself on the phone as an official of a nationalised bank’s Triangular Park branch where she has a savings account.  The person called on Thursday and apparently said her account would be closed as her KYC documents weren’t updated and that the only way to prevent it before the total lockdown and the weekend was to share with him her debit card details.Once he got hold of the details, he carried out multiple online transactions and told her that he was transferring the money from her account to the bank’s e-wallet service, police said.After transferring close to Rs 40,000, the caller asked for the card details of other family members, complainant Debjani Biswas, 47, said.The resident of Panditiya Road in Ballygunge said the first call came on Thursday morning before the government called off the total lockdown on Saturday. “The caller knew I have an account in the Triangular Park branch; so I did not doubt him. He kept saying my account would be closed and that I would have to pay a penalty of Rs 4,000 as my KYC documents were invalid,” Biswas, who teaches in a Ballygunge school, said.“He said there was no way to update the documents in the next three days because of the two-day total lockdown and Sunday. He told me that he would do the needful if I shared my card details with him.”She told Metro on Saturday that every time the person made an online transaction, she received an OTP on her phone. She had shared the OTPs with the caller in good faith, thinking the money was being transferred to an e-wallet of her own account, she said.When she refused to share card details of other family members, the caller apparently told her that the entire money would be withdrawn from her account. When she still hesitated, the caller hung up only to call again the next morning.“This time, I was standing right near my mother when the call came. He kept insisting we would lose a lot of money if we did not add a nominee to my mother’s account and that he needed my card details to do that,” Biswas’s daughter Tiyasha, 20, said.“My mother had panicked… just to console her, I gave her my card from another bank. But before I could react she had shared my card details, along with the CVV (a 3-digit number printed on the signature panel on the back of the card). The person tried to carry out online transactions from my account, too. But luckily there was little money and the transactions were possibly declined.”The man spoke in Bengali and had full knowledge of Biswas’s account number. Realising the fraud, she and her daughter lodged a complaint with Rabindra Sarobar police station and then with the anti-bank fraud section at Lalbazar.Preliminary investigations showed the money had not been transferred to any e-wallet. It had been used for purchases on various online portals, the police said.Hundreds of people are cheated similarly on the phone every month. In June and July, the city police had received more than 1,700 such complaints, of which close to 1,600 had a connection with Jamtara in Jharkhand.In the case of Biswas, cops are still to ascertain where the call came from, the police said.",2020-09-13 03:50:00
1358,Mita Mukherjee,Department in CU set for online invigilation - Telegraph India,"Final-year postgraduate students of microbiology department of Calcutta University will be monitored through online invigilation by teachers during the fourth semester examinations to be held next month.The students will have to keep the video cameras on in devices like smartphones, laptops or desktops at the time of taking the test, a teacher of the department said.One or two teachers will be on duty on all the examination days who will invigilate the examinees through an online process, the teacher said.The examinations will be conducted using a virtual platform like Zoom or Google Meet and the students will have to log in and out according to the time to be prescribed by the university.A mock test will be held soon to ensure that students get used to the system and they do not face any problem when they take the exams.The final (fourth) semester examinations will be conducted by all the 68 postgraduate departments of the university in October. No other department has taken the decision on invigilating the examinees online till now, an official of the university said.The university had recently announced that the individual departments would send the questions through emails or WhatsApp to the examinees half an hour before the start of the examination. After the exam, the students will have to upload the answers in PDF format through emails or WhatsApp.But the individual postgraduate departments enjoy the autonomy to conduct their examinations using their own system, the official said.The board of studies of the microbiology department of the university has taken the decision on online invigilation not because it does not trust the students, the teacher said. The main intention is to maintain the “sanctity” of the examinations, the teacher explained. “The decision has been taken to ensure that our students do not suffer in future.”The university had no experience of teaching students through the online process when it started doing so after institutions had to be shut because of Covid-19 in March, said Alok Sil, the head of the department of microbiology .“We are conducting the online classes successfully. We are hopeful that we will also be successful in invigilating the students online,” he said.  Postgraduate microbiology is taught also by at least two colleges, including Lady Brabourne. Shiuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College, said she had received a letter from the microbiology department. “We are expecting detailed guidelines from the university,” Sarkar said.",2020-09-13 04:23:00
1359,"Debraj Mitra, Anshuman Phadikar","Elephant calf drowns in West Midnapore, herd turns back - Telegraph India","An elephant calf drowned in a river in West Midnapore in the early hours of Saturday, forest officials said.The calf, less than a month old, was part of a herd that was crossing the Tamal, a river south of Goaltore town in West Midnapore, around 200km from Calcutta.The drowning is being attributed to a surge in the water level in the river because of the monsoon.“We received an alert around 2.30am. The carcass of the calf was found further downstream.Prima facie, it seems the calf was washed away by the strong currents and died of drowning. The body has been sent for post-mortem,” said the divisional forest officer of Rupnarayan division.A local forest official said the incident was “unusual and unfortunate”.“Elephants are expert swimmers and adult females in a herd are very careful with calves.They keep a close eye on the little ones. While crossing a river, the calves lean on the rear of an adult female or her trunk for support. The river in question is hardly 40 metres wide. Even with strong currents, it is unusual that an elephant calf will get washed away,” said the official.A conservation ecologist who has researched on elephants said a calf drowning or being washed away is not new.“Calves get better at swimming as they grow up. In north Bengal, the forest department has in the past rescued calves that were washed away by river currents. One such calf was named Teesta, after the river in which it was lost and found. Teesta is now a full-grown elephant,” said Aritra Kshettry, a research fellow with the Union ministry of science and technology, who is working in north Bengal now.The herd that the calf was a part of has over 20 elephants, said local forest officials. The herd had been camping at Kadamdiha forest in Goaltore range for the past couple of days.The herd split into two groups on Friday. A forest official said the first group started heading north towards the Nayabasat forest in Hoomgarh range on Friday evening. The group crossed the same river without trouble.“The calf was part of the second group which took the same route. But after the calf was washed away, the group did not cross the river and came back to Kadamdiha forest. They stayed there for the rest of the night,” the official added.Herds of elephants from Dalma enter the forests of Jhargram, Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore in south Bengal every year and spend several months before heading back to Jharkhand. The forests of south Bengal are interspersed with human settlements and farmlands that provide easy sources of food for the pachyderms.Some herds make south Bengal forests their home and do not go back to Jharkhand.",2020-09-13 04:29:00

The doctor who checked on him decided to put him on oxygen support. He told us that my brother is extremely weak,” the brother said.The man, who lost his job of a parking attendant during the lockdown, had been without food for the past couple of days. He had survived on a loaf of bread and a laddu he bought from a tea stall near the place where he was found lying under the elevated Metro corridor in Duttabad, his brother said.“The man is quite weak and he had complained of difficulty in breathing. His oxygen levels are below normal and we have put him on oxygen support,” a doctor at the safe house said.The man had wandered in Salt Lake for three days before he was found under the elevated Metro corridor on Friday.He was afraid to go home because of his elderly parents. He has said that he hadn’t received any call or instruction on what to do from the authorities.He was taken to the safe house after some Duttabad residents alerted the fire and emergency services minister, Sujit Bose, and local councillor Nirmal Dutta.

1361,Kinsuk Basu ,Vandals storm David Hare college - Telegraph India,"Vandals scaled the wall of the West Bengal University of Teachers’ Training, Education, Planning and Administration’s David Hare campus on Ballygunge Circular Road on Friday night and damaged the server room, the auditorium and the music room.Several AC units have been destroyed and electrical wires snapped. Those who carried out the destruction had entered the teacher education department head’s room and damaged furniture, police said.People still refer to the institute by its earlier name, David Hare Training College.Cops have started investigating the matter based on a complaint filed by the university officials at Ballygunge police station. The police are scanning CCTV footage to find out if the vandals had entered the four-storey building from the rear or the front.The hostel on the campus is almost empty barring a few people from other states who have not been able to leave, the police said.“It is a disgrace that an institution that bears the name of David Hare has been vandalised,” Sonia Chattopadhyay, a teacher at the institution, said.Some police officers said the trigger could be a campaign that has been gathering momentum on social media protesting the university’s decision to hold fourth semester exams for BEd and MEd at “home centres” during the pandemic.The first exam for BEd students is scheduled for October 1 and for MEd on October 6.On September 8, the university had issued a notice with the schedule for the exams. Amit Kumar Bhattacharjee, the university’s controller of examinations, had said in the notice that exams would be conducted at home centres.Some students felt they would have to physically turn up at colleges for the exams.The next day, the university issued another notice clarifying students could take the exams from their homes, online. The notice said there was no question of holding exams on the campus and termed the allegation that it had not kept in mind the pandemic “completely false”.“We will talk to several students to find out if this was an orchestrated attack,” an officer of Ballygunge police station said.",2020-09-13 05:12:00

They will attend online classes while they are in quarantine in the hostels for 14 days.“Of the 62 students, 55 will reach the campus in four batches as part of a staggered entry during the pandemic. The remaining seven are still to decide on reaching the campus,” the official said.On Friday, 61 of the institute’s 82 teachers wrote to the board of governors wondering if it was prudent to call students to the campus during the pandemic.They are worried that the students’ presence on the campus could pose “grave health risks”. They have said the institute hadn’t consulted them on the matter.The institute has prepared a campus entry protocol, including mandatory testing and quarantine, for the safety of students, another official said.According to the protocol shared with the students, they will undergo thermal scanning to measure their body temperature, a health check-up and their luggage would be sanitised.After completing the necessary formalities students will be allowed entry to their rooms. No Family member (parents/ spouse/children) will be allowed with the students on the campus, the official said.During the quarantine period, food will be served on the room’s doorstep by members of the mess operator’s staff.“Students will undergo regular health check-ups by a medical team of the institute. All students have to undergo a mandatory Covid test, in consultation with the team, within seven days of their arrival,” according to the protocol. “In case they have already undergone the test, they have to submit a copy of the report to the medical officer and hostel administration within 15 days.”Students will not be allowed to venture out of their rooms except for using certain utilities and specific essential purpose, including medical requirements.Students will be fined Rs 200 if they are found outside their rooms without a mask.Second-year students of the two-year MBA course have demanded that they be allowed on the campus to use the institute’s Net facility for unhindered online classes.“There are 462 students. If they start arriving in batches on the same ground, this would mean assembly on the campus. Unlike IIM Bangalore, the hostels of the MBA executive and the two-year MBA courses are on the campus at IIM Calcutta,” a teacher said.Metro’s text messages to institute director Anju Seth asking her if students of the two-year MBA course would be allowed on the campus went unanswered. Calls to her phone, too, went unanswered.",2020-09-13 05:37:00
1364,Subhajoy Roy,Plea for full-time Kolkata parks reopening - Telegraph India," The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has sought the Bengal home department’s permission to reopen the city’s parks for their full duration.Firhad Hakim, the chairperson of the corporation’s board of administrators, said on Saturday that the civic body had sought the permission of the state government’s home department for the reopening. The government will reply by Monday or Tuesday, Hakim said, adding that as sporting activities have been allowed in Unlock 4, unimpeded reopening of the parks should be facilitated.The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) maintains 700 parks, said an official of the civic body. A few other parks such as Rabindra Sarobar at Golpark-Dhakuria and Subhas Sarobar at Kada-para off EM Bypass are maintained by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which too is helmed by Hakim. If permission is granted, the CMDA-run parks will also reopen.“I have asked the state home department to do something about the parks in our city. Now that sporting activities are being allowed gradually, we have asked for permission to reopen the parks. We cannot reopen them till the home department gives us permission,” Hakim said. “They will take some decision by Monday or Tuesday.”CMC officials said that all parks now remain open only from 6am to 9am every day for morning walkers. Nobody is allowed inside beyond the stipulated hours and no sporting activities are allowed.If the home department grants permission, the parks can remain open for the full duration, welcoming visitors during the afternoon and evening too, the CMC official said.The Unlock 4 guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on August 29 has allowed sporting activities from September 21 but fixed an upper limit of 100 persons at each such gathering.“Social/academic/sports/entertainment/cultural/religious/political functions and other congregations with a ceiling of 100 persons will be permitted with effectfrom 21st September 2020 with mandatory wearing of face masks, social distancing, provision for thermal screening and hand wash or sanitiser,” the guidelines said. The withdrawal of restrictions does not apply to entertainment parks.",2020-09-13 05:43:00
1365,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus outbreak: Kolkata Metro ferries NEET aspirants - Telegraph India,"Metro trains rolled out with passengers after 173 days on Sunday, ferrying NEET candidates and their guardians.The city’s transport lifeline had suspended service on March 23 as a precaution against the spread of Covid-19. The first day went off smoothly as the number of passengers was just around 1,700.The real test awaits on Monday, the day the regular operations resume. The Metro authorities said they were gearing up for around 100,000 passengers on Monday.On Sunday, the first trains left the terminal stations at 10am. But commuters had started arriving much before that. National Eligibility cum Entrance Test was held from 2pm to 5pm but the reporting time at the centres was staggered for enforcement of Covid-19 protocols.Around 9.30am, there were more than 10 students, accompanied by family members, at Dum Dum station. Only two gates were open. Both were manned by RPF and police.“Please show your admit cards,” an RPF officer was heard telling a student. The students and their guardians had their body temperature checked by thermal scanners at the gates. They were given hand sanitisers before being directed towards ticket counters.They were asked the destination stations and given printed tickets. Smart card holders entered the platforms directly.Yellow lines were marked on the platform and at the ticket counters to maintain social distancing. The platform seats were also marked alternately.A total of 74 trains — 37 in each direction — ran on Sunday. Every alternate seat was cross-marked to maintain distancing protocols. But the low volume of passengers meant that many seats remained vacant.Under the supervision of RPF jawans, passengers stood in a queue before a train was about to enter the platform.“We entered the station around 9.55am. The train arrived after a few minutes,” said Shyamal Sikdar, who boarded a train from Dum Dum to Tollygunge. Sikdar’s son was to write the NEET at a centre near Tollygunge Metro station.“There were very few people in our compartment throughout the journey. It was a smooth ride,” said Sikdar.Aparna Patra and daughter Manisha had boarded a bus from Baguiati around 10am. They were not aware of Metro services. A passenger in the bus told Aparna about the special Metro trains for NEET aspirants. “We got down at Esplanade and took a train till Tollygunge. The Metro ride was quick and hassle free,” said Manisha. Metro staff at the stations were busy in the morning and evening guiding students and their family members. “It was good to be back doing what we are used to,” a station superintendent said.",2020-09-14 02:24:00
1366,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Covid: NEET turnout touches 90% in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The attendance was 80 to 90 per cent at many of the venues of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), through which all medical colleges in India admit students to their undergraduate courses, in the city on Sunday.Examinees said the availability of Metro trains made it easier for them to commute from their homes to their respective venues.Each of the 66 venues in Calcutta was allotted 200 to 900 candidates. “The attendance across most of the centres in Calcutta was about 80 to 90 per cent. The state administration and the police helped maintain social distancing outside the centres and also when the candidates entered and left a venue,” said an official associated with the exam.At a venue off EM Bypass, 717 of the 840 candidates turned up. At a Ballygunge centre, the turnout was 241 out of 300. Of the 780 candidates allotted to a Salt Lake centre, 690 turned up; of the 240 students assigned a centre near Rabindra Sadan, 191 wrote the exam; and of the 540 assigned a venue in central Calcutta, 451 appeared.In contrast, the attendance in the JEE (Main), held earlier this month, varied between 30 and 50 per cent in the city. The exam, also conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), was held across six days in only two centres in the city.The NEET candidates had to wear masks provided at the centres. At many venues, they wore gloves, too. “It was a little difficult to fill in the OMR sheets and turn pages wearing gloves,” said Ankan Maity, a Jadavpur resident who wrote the exam in Dum Dum. “Not just the exam, we were also worried about the infection.”According to the NTA guidelines, no more than 12 candidates were to be in each room.“We had followed all the protocols specified by NTA for the safety of the candidates…. We provided PPE kits to the guards at the gate,” said Loveleen Saigal, the principal of Birla High School.Several schools across the city opened their gates to students after a period of almost six months. “It was like a mock drill for us,” said Saigal.“Initially, we were jittery. After a gap of so many months so many people were coming to the school, but it went off well,” said Sanghamitra Mukherjee, the rector of Gokhale Memorial Girls’ School.Srijan Moitra, who lives in Sinthee, took Metro to reach his exam centre in Narendrapur. “Had there been no Metro, I would have had to cover the distance of 25km in a hired car or an app cab. It would have taken more time and been more expensive,” said Srijan.Not all candidates, however, were that fortunate. Basanti Paul had to travel from a village in Bagnan, in Howrah, to write the exam at a centre in Mandirtala, near Shibpur. She started at 8.30am and reached home at 7.30pm.",2020-09-14 03:06:00
1367,Debraj Mitra,Rush for Kolkata Metro e-passes - Telegraph India,"Over 2,500 e-passes for Monday were booked within an hour of the launch of the URL pathadisha.com/metro at 8pm on Sunday.The developers said the rush was increasing and by a little after 9pm, there were “over 20 hits per second”.In comparison, only about 1,700 passengers travelled by Metro throughout Sunday, when the carrier ran a curtailed service for NEET aspirants. The difference in the rush underscored the challenges awaiting the authorities in enforcing crowd control and social distancing measures from Monday, when the career resumes regular operations after 174 days.Metro tried booking an e-pass from 8.10pm on Sunday but could finally book one at 8.52pm.“Heavy traffic and poor connectivity can hamper bookings. We had not expected such a rush. When the link went live, only one server was operational. But within 30 minutes, we had to press two more into action,” said an official of the agency that has developed the technology.The e-pass is only for entry into a station and a passenger will need a smart card to enter a platform and board a train, said officials.New smart cards can be bought from ticket counters. Tokens have been suspended for now.The low volume of passengers on Sunday meant smooth implementation of crowd control and social distancing protocols. But the real test will start on Monday, said Metro officials.Calcutta Metro’s security is the responsibility of the Railway Protection Force. But the agency will have to depend on local police for crowd control, especially at the station gates.Senior Metro officials told this newspaper multiple times over the past few days that controlling the crowd at the station gates was the key to smooth operations under the “new normal”. The agency has come up with a list of do’s and don’ts for Metro travellers.The developers of the technology said a dynamic algorithm — based on data provided by Metro — is driving the system.The algorithm has put a cap on the number of passengers that will be allowed at every station in a time slot. The passes are being provided accordingly. The day’s bookings have been divided into 12 one-hour slots. Based on that algorithm, around 1,000 passengers are expected to be at Dum Dum station between 9am and 10am on Monday.During the same slot, only 25 are expected at Park Street.An input based on these estimates has been shared with the police. “The idea is to have more deployment at busy stations,” said a Metro official.“Dum Dum and Esplanade are expected to be among the busier stations. Local trains have not resumed yet. Otherwise, managing crowds at Dum Dum would have been more difficult,” said a Metro official.The carrier will run 110 trains from Monday. The first and last trains will leave the terminal stations at 8am and 7pm, respectively.Metro’s operational fleet comprises 23 air-conditioned trains and six non-AC rakes.“For running 110 trips, we need around a dozen rakes. The upkeep of the rakes has to be done in the daytime because there is a staff crunch at night. But we will try to run as many air-conditioned trains as possible,” said another official.The first and only operational phase of East-West Metro, too, will resume service on Monday.

1368,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Covid: Parents not ready for in-person classes - Telegraph India,"Pandemic-wary parents are hesitant to send their wards to school, even those who are in senior classes, conversations the city institutions have had with guardians and pupils have revealed.Teachers and school heads have found out that the parents are mainly concerned about the possibility of their children getting infected, sharing transport or car pool and maintaining safeguards. Many parents are not ready to send their wards to school even for a few hours and only on some days a week.The central government has said schools outside containment zones can reopen from September 21 but only for students of Classes IX to XII and that too only for seeking guidance of teachers. Parents’ written consent is a must.A school head said another “stumbling block” for the institutions was the allocation of teachers if a small section of students agrees to attend classes in person.The schools are also discussing how teachers can take simultaneous online and in-person classes as there will be a section of students who will be at home while another batch will be in school.“We have been speaking to parents and they are sceptical and not very confident about sending their children to school. They are more concerned about travelling from home to school and school to home because in between they will be exposed to contact with others in cars or in any other transport,” said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James’ School.He said the school would be regularly sanitised and teachers would ensure social distancing in class, but the parents are worried about the breaks and what could happen when the students would enter and leave school.Some schools are considering asking students to come a few days a week only to clear doubts and seek guidance from teachers with parental consent, but such a possibility seems unlikely under the circumstances.“We have been speaking to the students’ council and also individually to students and based on their response we have found out that parents are unwilling to send their children to school,” said Anjana Saha, the principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy. She said the school had gauged that not more than 20 per cent of students were ready to return to school. Mahadevi Birla, however, will send a form to parents to get their feedback.Several schools are also deliberating the logistics, especially if simultaneous online and in-person classes are to be held.",2020-09-14 04:33:00
1369,"Jhinuk Mazumdar, Gautam Bose",From construction site to NEET centre - Telegraph India,"A boy who had quit studies after higher secondary exams and started working on a daily wage to support his family appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, the gateway to undergraduate medical courses in the country, on Sunday.Tapan Parua had been eking out a living for himself and his family over the past few years by carrying building materials at construction sites in Mumbai and Bangalore. He decided to leave it all in December 2019 and come back home to Sagar Island, in South 24-Parganas, to study.“I was working on a daily wage and sending money home. But it was not enough because my parents are ailing and they need more money,” Tapan said before entering his exam centre, DPS Ruby Park.“One day it dawned on me that to have a standing in life, I had to study. People rarely respect you if you are not educated.”Tapan arrived in Calcutta on Saturday. Accompanied by his brother-in-law, Tapan walked a kilometre from their village in Hatkhola to Ghoramara island. They then took a boat to Lot number 8 and from there a bus to Behala, where they stayed the night at a relative’s house.At home, preparing for the medical entrance exam did not entail a break from the struggle to keep the family afloat. At times, he had to help his brothers on the field.“That is part of life, I don’t mind it. Such are our circumstances,” Tapan said.The family lives in a house with a tiled roof, which gets flooded during the monsoon. “We shift to a relative’s house in the village and come back after water recedes,” he said.“They earn very little. If they don’t work for a day they won’t get paid,” said Tapan’s brother-in-law, Tapan Naskar, who is a mason.The village where the family lives hardly has any medical facilities.“For any treatment, we have to travel 18km to Kakdwip,” said the examinee. “If I have to give my family and myself a decent life, I have to do some job. Else, we will continue struggling…. I don’t know what is in store for us.”",2020-09-14 04:40:00
1370,Snehal Sengupta,Vacant plot selected to relocate shops and houses falling in the path of airport Metro line - Telegraph India,"A vacant plot in Sector V, behind the Technopolis building, has been selected to relocate more than 70 shops and houses that are in the path of the New Garia-airport Metro line in Mahishbathan, said a member of the committee set up to resolve the land issue.The houses and the shops are creating a hurdle in the construction of the pillars that will support the elevated corridor of the Metro link.The state government has formed a committee to facilitate removal of obstacles so land could be made available for the project. The committee is headed by Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose, who is also the state's fire and emergency services minister, and has representatives of Hidco, Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA), Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, transport department and the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate as members.Bose said they had identified the buildings that needed to be razed to make room for the Metro corridor. “We are planning to relocate the shopkeepers and residents to a vacant plot in Sector V, behind Technopolis. We have written to the urban development department, which owns the plot,” Bose said.""We have conducted a survey and asked the residents to cooperate. They will be transferred to temporary houses (to be set up on the plot behind Technopolis) till we can relocate them properly.""Metro visited the area on Sunday afternoon and saw at least a dozen structures - some of which housing eateries, electrical fittings shops and shacks selling fritters — standing in the way of the proposed alignment.NDITA chairman Debashis Sen said the structures on the plot - in Sector V's AQ block, opposite Positional Astronomy Centre - would be of bricks and would have asbestos roofs. “These will be simple sheds that can be built in a short time. We have to get permission from the urban development department before we start building the sheds,” said Sen.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation had in 2018 demolished four buildings under the flyover that connects Sector V with New Town to make way for the Metro project. Construction of the 1.45-km viaduct between Mahishbathan and New Town had been stalled for six years since the project was commissioned because of these buildings.The demolition took place after the North 24-Parganas district administration issued notices saying the buildings would be pulled down and the owners compensated. Two of the razed buildings were private properties. One was Blue Orchid Hotel, identified in the civic records as the “White Building or OYO Hotels”. The other building housed multiple shops and warehouses and was listed in the records as “AS Media Enterprise, Super Glass and New Mohini Sweets”.These buildings had fully or partially occupied government plots.The third structure demolished had housed Mohisgote Free Primary School, which had been shifted a year earlier.",2020-09-14 04:49:00
1371,Subhankar Chowdhury,Covid: IIT Kharagpur campus closure extended till September 18 - Telegraph India,"IIT Kharagpur has extended the closure of the campus till September 18 as Covid-19 cases are still being reported on the campus.A notice signed by the institute's registrar, B.N. Singh, announced the extension of the closure, during which safety measures will be “strictly implemented”.The authorities had earlier announced that the campus would be closed for at least a week. The week since the closure began ended on Sunday, but the authorities decided to extend it as the spread of the coronavirus could not be contained entirely and contact tracing was on.With the closure having been extended, no employee of the institute will be permitted to leave the campus till further orders, except for emergency. Those who stay outside the campus are not allowed to enter.The employees who stay on the campus but are currently outside have been asked to stay where they are and work from there.“After a review of the situation, we felt that there was a need to extend the closure till September 18 as the chain of spread could not be broken entirely. Besides, the task of contact tracing is not over yet,” an official said.The OPD of BC Roy Technology Hospital on the campus, which remained closed till September 13, will operate with limited OPD/medicine renewal services only for campus residents. The hospital also caters to retired employees who stay outside the campus.Retired employees and even the serving ones who stay outside the campus are not allowed to visit the hospital and have been advised to buy medicines locally.If people from outside are let in, there can be a spurt in Covid cases because cases are on the rise around the campus,” said an official.The first positive case on the campus was recorded on August 19. The count shot up close to 30 by September 5, a surge that prompted the institute to take steps to break the chain of spread.Although cases are being reported, the rate of spread of the virus has slowed down. The drop in intensity has convinced the authorities to extend the closure.No domestic help and gardener will be allowed to enter the campus. All offices of the institute will remain closed, according to the notice issued by the registrar.“We need to urgently stop the spread of the virus on the campus because hospitals outside the campus are dealing with a rising number of cases in Kharagpur town and the rest of West Midnapore district and do not have adequate beds,” said an official of the institute.The dean of students affairs at the IIT, Somesh Kumar, had last week told the students that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a bed for a Covid patient in hospitals in Calcutta. Among those infected, five are students.The IIT had on September 8 requested the 60-odd students still on the campus to leave at the earliest as it was “highly risky’’ to stay in hostels amid the Covid-19 pandemic considering the “stressed and insufficient medical facilities’’ in the town. Around 30 have since left for home.",2020-09-14 04:51:00
1372,Our Special Correspondent,David Hare campus vandalism suspects held - Telegraph India,"Two men were arrested on Sunday in connection with the vandalism on the David Hare campus of the West Bengal University of Teachers’ Training, Education, Planning and Administration, on Ballygunge Circular Road, late on Friday.Biswajit Mondal and Meghnad Mondal, who were picked up from a slum behind the campus, have reportedly told the police that they had carried out the vandalism to steal copper wires.A huge amount of copper wires and other items were seized from them.“We are trying to find out whether the two were engaged by anyone. They said they entered the campus by scaling the wall from behind,” an officer of Ballygunge police station said.Some university officials suspect the vandalism was linked to a rumour among students that they would have to turn up in colleges to appear in the fourth-semester BEd and MEd exams.“There could be more to it than what meets the eye. If it were just for copper wires, why was the server room vandalised?” asked a professor.",2020-09-14 04:54:00
1373,Subhajoy Roy,Helpline for mental health - Telegraph India,"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a steep rise in the number of people seeking help for mental health issues, speakers at the launch of the golden jubilee celebrations of Antara, a hospital for mental illnesses, said on Sunday.The hospital in Narendrapur, which started the celebrations through an online programme, launched a helpline to address the needs of the rising number of people with mental illness. An official said the number - 18001205589 - would remain open from 9am to 6pm, from Monday to Saturday.There are plans to run the helpline 24X7 after recruiting more counsellors.People of all age groups are suffering because of the pandemic. Adolescents who had no mental health issues before are showing signs of illness, a consequence of anxiety because of uncertainty over their studies amid the pandemic.Children are suffering because they are unable to meet their friends and do not like being indoors for months, said Indrani Chakraborty, the chief clinical psychologist of Antara.“A six-year-old girl I spoke with asked me why she could not meet her friends. She has become agitated for not being able to go out or meet friends. A five-year-old girl tried to kill herself by skipping ropes. She did not like the fact that she was staying at home with her elder sister while her parents were going out for work,” said Chakraborty.Another common problem, she said, is excessive fear among some people about contracting Covid-19, to the extent that they are not stepping out even to buy groceries.Antara started its journey from a building in Picnic Garden in 1971. Mathew P. John, the honorary general secretary of Antara, said the organisation was set up to treat mental health problems faced by people fleeing the erstwhile East Pakistan during the 1971 war.Mother Teresa had been the inspiration behind the setting up of the organisation.“Antara was set up to address mental health problems among refugees from East Pakistan and people wandering the streets of Calcutta. Gradually its scope expanded and now it is a 200-bed hospital with OPD and emergency treatment facilities,” Mathew told Metro.The hospital also runs a de-addiction facility and an indoor unit.Soumyo Chatterjee, the chief psychiatrist, said at the programme that many of the patients brought to the hospital by police even now were found loitering around. “They are kept here and treated. Some were able to tell us their home addresses after a couple of years. Our personnel went with them to reunite them with their families in Assam and Bangladesh,” he said.The management of Antara said they were open to any form of donation and sponsorship because they wanted to expand.",2020-09-14 05:38:00
1374,"Chandreyee Ghose  , Neha Singh",Young Metro: Debate on digital learning and online prize distribution - Telegraph India,"Sixteen students debated the pros and cons of digital learning at the 21st L.N. Birla Memorial Debate organised by Birla High School on July 11. The flagship event is held to mark the school’s Founder’s Day. This year’s motion — The Digital World Holds a Key to a Better Education System — had all the participants logged in from their homes as they debated the accessibility of the education system in the times of online classes.Best Speaker Kaushiki Ghosh also clinched the Best Team’s trophy for Shri Shikshayatan School with a resounding argument against the motion. According to her, in a country where most government-aided primary institutions run out of derelict and dingy buildings lacking basic infrastructure, digitisation is a luxury. “Education is not just about facts, figures, statistics and theorems, it is about shaping the personality too. Where do we learn our morals in this online world? Where is the experience-based learning?” said the feisty debater. It was Kaushiki’s first time at an online debate.According to principal Loveleen Saigal of Birla High School, Moira Street, not hosting the debate at all would have been a huge disappointment. “We were worried about technical glitches. We took a week to prepare. But we managed to ultimately host the event, though a truncated version, with maximum social distancing,” she said. Debater and a member of Calcutta Debating Circle S.V. Raman moderated the debate.BDM International School celebrated their annual prize distribution ceremony online. The achievers were felicitated with e-certificates and cash prizes. It included the highest scorers in individual subjects of both Class X and XII board examinations 2019-20. Rendition of the school song by students and lighting the lamp also took place. Every year, the event used to coincide with the school fest, giving it the shape of an annual jamboree. However, the motive behind this event that was to encourage children to push their boundaries so that they could come up with flying colours in future was fulfilled this time as well. “Although we could not celebrate prize distribution in the way we had done it in the past, the biggest gain for me was that we could see the satisfaction on the faces of the parents as well which eluded us before, as only the students came to collect the certificates on stage. Yes, we missed personal touches, but this new normal is not entirely negative as the silver lining of this pandemic is that we are getting acquainted with new technologies,” said principal Vijaya Chaudhuri.",2020-09-14 05:47:00

But the love and care that I have found for whatever little I did — along with my family — will spur me to stand up and rise in protest if something similar plays out in front of me again,” Nilanjana told Metro before leaving Ruby General Hospital for her parent’s home in Anandapur.“I have even told my daughter the same — shirdnara soja korey cholbey (walk with your spine straight). People who get bullied tend to become a bully and the cycle continues,” she said.Nilanjana was returning home with her husband Deep Satpathi and their daughter around midnight on September 5 when she heard a woman crying for help from inside a speeding Honda City.This was near a deserted stretch of a road near Abhyudoy Housing Complex in Anandapur, off EM Bypass. Nilanjana, and her husband and daughter were returning home after attending a dinner on the occasion of her mother’s birthday. As Deep pulled over and forced the Honda City to come to a halt, a woman was thrown out of the vehicle. Injured in her arms, she was shivering in fear.The man at the wheel of the Honda City, identified as Abhishek Kumar Panda, took a U-turn and fled and mounted the left front wheel over Nilanjana’s left leg.Panda was arrested a few days later. The woman allegedly thrown off the car reportedly told the police that she and Panda were to get married.“Many people have been telling me that the victim had changed her statements before the police. I have realised that women have to bear a lot of pressure, from the family, society and even friends. But just because she was to get married to the man doesn't mean he would assault her,"" Nilanjana said.Doctors at the hospital said Nilanjana had responded well to the treatment. “She has been advised to try and walk a few steps every day at home. She will have to spare her injured leg for the time being and try putting her weight on the right leg,” said an official of the hospital.  Nurses and other employees joined Nilanjana as she was taken out of her cabin. Some sang a Rabindra Sangeet. Nilanjana held up one of her hands with a clenched fist, her face glowing with a smile.",2020-09-14 05:52:00
1376,Chandrima S. Bhattacharya ,"A solo traveller around the world, on a bicycle - Telegraph India","Lipika Biswas’s landing in Europe for the first time in July 2018 was with a thud. She was in Frankfurt where first the immigration officer would not believe that a woman from India was on a two-month cycling tour in Europe, alone. Then Biswas realised that no mechanic was free to help her re-assemble her bicycle, which she was lugging behind her packed in a box.But Biswas is not someone who gives up easily. Getting to Frankfurt had not been easy either.She calls herself a solo traveller. An Eastern Railways employee where she works as a senior clerk, Biswas, who turns 52 on Wednesday, had planned the Europe tour meticulously. She would bike from Germany to Iceland. With loans from friends and a very supportive family, she had managed to put together Rs 4.5 lakh for the trip, and had trained herself relentlessly, but had missed the bit about the re-assembling.In Frankfurt, she lost a day trying to get a mechanic to help her and several Euros, which would always and instantly be converted into rupees in her mind. “I paid Rs 3,500 as taxi fare in Frankfurt just to move to a new accommodation,” says Biswas, a resident of Kasba. The next day she got to work herself, going by instinct, and put together her bike, and set off for Mainz, when she also realised that she did not know how to use GPS.But the roads held her up, as she was borne by the kindness of strangers.Biswas had been a mountaineer from 1994, the year she joined the railways. She wanted to be an adventurer. She had grown up in Palta, on the outskirts of Calcutta, attending school there and college in Naihati. “I was a tomboy. I played daant-guli. No dolls for me,” says Biswas.She joined a local mountaineering club, Nababganj Mountain Lovers, and with them, as with others, “summited” several Himalayan mountain peaks. In 1995 she trekked up to Kalindi Pass, which connects Gangotri and Gastoli. Within a few years, she was a veteran. For two years, 2014 and 2015, she was part of an Everest expedition team, but on both occasions she had to return from the base camp as the expeditions were cancelled.She had always loved cycling. The last few years she has turned to these “magic wheels”.“I still wanted to go far,” she said. To be able to go up mountains that seem to be rising straight up is to conquer fear. “While going up I would think not again. Coming down I would want to return right then.”But she also wanted to go alone. It would help her to confront the final frontiers of fear. A doctor friend, her adviser, told her to try Europe. It would be “safe”.So there she was, on way to Mainz from Frankfurt, on a bicycle assembled by herself for the first time.In Mainz, she was told at a late hour that she would have to cross the Rheine to camp. Biswas would either be hosted by members of Warm Showers, an international free touring cyclists community, or stay at Airbnb places, or camp in her own tent wherever possible, even in someone’s garden, spending as little money as possible on food. But in Mainz, the couple told her she could stay the night at their place. This would be the first of the many homes that would be offered to her by strangers.“One of the best things about cycling is meeting people,” says Biswas. She made many friends in Europe. She did not face a single incident of racism, she feels. She felt appreciated, though she surprised many as an “Indian woman” out on such a tour.She rattles off the names of places she visited: Mainz, Cologne, Duisberg, to Arnhem, Amsterdam, Zalk (a village in the Netherlands), back to Germany, and Fehmarn, from where she entered Denmark. Then she visited Sweden and Norway. From Norway she reached Iceland from Faroe Islands by ferry. Reaching Iceland was an emotional moment. She biked through the country from Seyðisfjörður to Reykjavik, from where she took a flight to Calcutta via Copenhagen and Delhi.“On some days I cycled for 100 to 120km,”says Biswas. “My friend from Calcutta insisted that I go wild camping. So I stayed alone in the forest at Kronsjo the night before I entered Norway from Sweden.”She discovered the pleasure of railway waiting rooms. At Lunden, near Flam in Norway, she decided to spend the night at the tiny railway station just because it was so heart-stoppingly beautiful. She was the only one at the waiting room, surrounded by mountains and an immense solitude.She also made friends out of a few Indian ambassadors at the capitals. “Despite some problems, the tour went off quite well,” says Biswas, who was back in Calcutta after two months.Only to be back in another part of Europe the next year, same time, for two months. She took off from Vienna, biked through Budapest, Belgrade and Sofia to Istanbul, where she had a brainwave.She felt she must visit Greece. She went to the island of Lesbos, the home of Sappho, the greatly admired poet of ancient Greece who also gives her name to the Sapphic tradition.Biswas visited the island, but when she wanted to enter Turkey again, from where she would take the flight home, she realised that she had a one-entry visa. She spent a deeply anxious night with her passport taken away, after which she was finally granted another visa for Turkey.Last year in April, she had also gone on a bike tour of Sri Lanka, but with a friend.“And I will go again,” she says. And looks proudly at her three bikes – a folding bike, a mountain bike and a touring bike — which are all parked happily inside her bedroom at her small Kasba apartment.She wants Calcutta to be more cycle-friendly. The cycle is as good for our personal health as it is for our environment, not to mention women’s empowerment, she points out. During the pandemic many cycles are out in the streets.“But in Calcutta cyclists should also learn to follow traffic signals,” she insists.",2020-09-14 05:58:00
1377,Debraj Mitra,Unlock 4: Need for e-pass to board Kolkata Metro put people off - Telegraph India,"Around 20,000 people boarded Metro trains on Monday, when the carrier resumed services for all after 174 days.The Metro authorities had geared up for around 100,000 passengers in the run-up to the resumption of commercial services in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The actual number made their job easier and Day One went off reasonably smoothly.The developer of the technology behind the e-pass — needed for access to Metro stations — had on Sunday told Metro that over 2,500 passes were booked in the first hour since the link’s launch at 8pm.“Around 53,000 passes were booked for Monday. But many people did not turn up. It seems some booked passes to get familiar with the system,” said an official of the agency that has developed the system.The number should go up in the coming days, said Metro officials.Railway officials suggested that the need to book an e-pass put many people off. At Dum Dum, Tollygunge and some other stations, groups of passengers were seen seeking help from Metro personnel, cops and fellow passengers in booking e-passes.The first trains left the terminal stations at 8am on Monday. Dum Dum saw a semblance of rush during the morning and Park Street in the evening. Otherwise, the volume of passengers was low throughout the day.From 9am, the queue at Dum Dum station started getting longer. Around 9.55am, the queue at gate number 4 had over 50 passengers. But around the same time, a train left New Garia station with less than five passengers.Around 6pm, Park Street had scores of passengers on both platforms and a New Garia-bound train was reasonably full when it left the station.“I had to travel in crowded buses to reach my office. A crowded Metro is a better option than a crowded bus,” said Biswajit Sarkar, a Kasba resident who boarded a train from Kalighat. He was in for a surprise after entering the station.The coach he boarded around 11.30am only had four other occupants.The authorities had geared up for a maximum of 400 passengers on each train and 50 in each coach. But barring a few trains that left Dum Dum in the morning, most others did not even ferry half that number.“Around 20,000 passengers took Metro trains in the Noapara-Kavi Subhash (New Garia) corridor till 7pm, when the last trains left the terminal stations,” said Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee.Only a couple of gates — one each for entry and exit — were opened for passengers at most stations. Police and RPF personnel guarded the gates, where every passenger was asked to show his or her colour-coded pass.A limited number of ticket counters were open for passengers to recharge smart cards and buy new ones.The interval between two trains was 10 and 15 minutes during different slots of the day.In the East-West corridor, the passenger count was around 80, said the Metro spokesperson.",2020-09-15 01:20:00
1378,Debraj Mitra,Unlock 4: Calcutta Metro resumed services for all after 174 days - Telegraph India,"The Telegraph took a Metro ride from Tollygunge to Chandni Chowk on Monday, when the carrier resumed services for all after 174 days. The service was suspended on March 23 because of the Covid pandemic.Here’s what we saw on MondayA handful of people were huddled near a tea stall outside Tollygunge Metro station around 10.10am on Monday. Asish Kumar Rout was the centre of attraction in the group. His pull — familiarity with the system of booking e-passes.The group included two middle-aged men and a younger man who seemed unable to book passes. Rout could book passes for two of them. When he tried booking an e-pass for the third, he could not.The queue outside the main gate of the station had over 20 people. Cops at the gate were asking each commuter to show the colour-coded e-pass. A thermal gun scanned every wrist for the body temperature before letting people in.Another cop standing beside the metal detector gate directed every entrant to a hand sanitiser dispenser. A couple of passengers preferred taking a sanitiser out of their bags and using it in front of the cop.The next stop was the ticket counter. Two of the five counters were operational. Only a handful of people stood in front of each, for recharge of smart cards. Before the carrier suspended operations, the queue at the counters seemed never ending.Two of the many flap gates were being used for entry into the platform. Yellow lines on the platform — painted to maintain social distancing — outnumbered passengers.An air-conditioned rake arrived within five minutes. An RPF jawan stood at the gate of a coach to keep an eye on the passengers boarding the train. At Tollygunge, the number of people boarding the train was much more than those getting off it.Inside the train, most seats allotted for passengers — every alternate one was cross-marked to maintain distancing — were occupied. Only the last coach had several vacant seats. Seats reserved for senior citizens were mostly vacant. A Metro employee was doing the rounds of the coaches, guiding passengers and occasionally taking pictures.The public address system switched between two announcements — about Covid-19 protocols and an approaching station. The stop time at each station was around 30 seconds. It seemed more than enough because only a few people were boarding or getting off the train.The usual Monday morning rush at Kalighat and Rabindra Sadan meant people jostling for an inch of space and doors refusing to close because of the crowds. On Monday, only a handful of passengers were waiting on the platforms. At some stations, there were none.Metro officials had said they would not allow more than 50 people in a coach.The coach this correspondent boarded had around 20 passengers. At Esplanade, five people boarded the coach — the maximum between Tollygunge and Chandni Chowk.",2020-09-15 01:35:00
1379,Kinsuk Basu,Durga Puja 2020: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee suggests precaution for festivities in the season of pandemic - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said Durga Puja pandals should be kept open on the sides to ensure free flow of air, stressing one of the key precautions against the spread of Covid-19.“Durga Puja is a big challenge and in Bengal, it is a national festival. Let the pandals be kept open so that there is circulation of air,” Mamata said in Nabanna. “Open thakley hawa batash boibe (If it is kept open, air will flow). It is for precaution. To be safe.”The Puja starts on October 22 (Sashthi) and many organisers across Calcutta have started erecting pandals.“We will request the Puja committees to keep the pandals open on the sides. There is no point keeping some provisions for ventilation. Khola howa thakley onek bhalo hobey (It would be better if there is free passage of air),” the chief minister said. Bengal is not unfamiliar with what Mamata has suggested. Till the advent of theme-based pujas, pandals across Calcutta used to be largely open structures.The idols would be placed in a three side-covered area and the main pandal would open into a mandap or a shamiana.Since the time theme-based Pujas became fashionable, pandals would be made in a manner that would require visitors to enter the structures to watch the idols.Mamata said the customary meeting with the puja organisers would be held on September 25, where the precautionary steps needed to be taken would be discussed.“Many visitors turn up at pandals to offer anjali. If the pandal is kept open, it would be easier to breathe. If there are any germs, even those will go away,” Mamata said, explaining why she felt the need for restructuring puja pandals this year.“The (corona)virus is yet to go away. I’m not saying about the area where the deity will be kept. But the remaining space can be kept open.”Mahalaya, which for many marks the beginning of Bengal’s autumn festivity, usually precedes the Puja by a week. But this year the occasion is just two days away and more than a month before the Puja.Around 4,500 community pujas are organised in the city every year. With the Covid-19 pandemic playing havoc, most organisers have cut down their budgets, opting for smaller idols and trimming other expenditures. But themes have remained.With the chief minister suggesting to keep pandals open, several organisers said they would have to sit down with the artists to find a way out so that the themes prevailed and the pandals were kept open.“There is not much time. We will have to sit with our artists and discuss Plan B,” said Sandipan Banerjee, of Behala Notun Dal puja committee. “I think a clear picture will emerge when we get to meet the chief minister.”The chief minister also referred to the global advisory board she had earlier set up for Covid-19 management and said the panel suggested keeping puja pandals open.

1381,Debraj Mitra,Kolkata Metro commuters complain of recharge glitch - Telegraph India,"Several Metro passengers alleged glitches in the online smart card recharge system on Monday, the day the carrier resumed services for all after 174 days.The commuters said they had recharged their cards online recently but on Monday, the updated balance was not being reflected on the card-reading machines at the stations.Station officials took down details of such complainants at almost every station. Around 10.05am at Tollygunge station, the register had around 10 names, said a passenger who faced a similar issue. Around 10.40am, a similar register at Chandni Chowk station had over 15 names, said a passenger.“On Friday, I had done an online recharge of Rs 1,000 through the Metro app (Metro Railway Kolkata). I got a message from my bank, confirming that my account had been debited. But on Monday, the card-reading machine at the station did not reflect the balance,” said a man who was headed to Rabindra Sadan from Tollygunge.A Behala resident entered Tollygunge station around 10.05am but could not board a train before 10.35am because of the alleged glitch.“I had opted for a Rs 100-recharge online on September 4 through the Metro app. The transaction history confirmed a top-up of Rs 100. But on Monday, the card-reading machine did not reflect anything, not even the previous balance,” said the passenger.From the ticket counter, he was redirected to the station superintendent’s room where officials told him that there was “a technical problem with the payment gateway”.“Kano je ei sob online koren (why do you do these things online)?” a station employee is said to have told the passenger.He was issued another card and asked to visit the station after a week. The problem will be sorted out by then and he will be given a refund against the updated balance of his previous card, officials said.Around 12.10pm, he received a message saying the September 4 online recharge “was successful”. He was asked to visit any Metro station to update his card balance.A Metro official said the money debited from a passenger’s account went to a bank’s pool before being transferred to the railways’ account.“I cannot comment on individual cases without studying them but similar issues happen when the system does not allow one payment unless the previous one is complete. A system which allows concurrent or parallel payments does not usually suffer from such problems,” said an official of a firm that handles IT solutions for government agencies.Metro general manager Manoj Joshi said he was aware of the problem. “Some passengers have faced the issue. It is a technical problem. Our officials are working on it and the problem will be addressed shortly,” he said.",2020-09-15 01:41:00
1382,Subhankar Chowdhury,20 more students want  to return to IIM campus - Telegraph India,"At least 20 of IIM Calcutta’s final-year MBA (two-year course) students have requested the institute to allow them to return to the campus and use its Net facility to attend disruption-free online classes, an official said.The requests started pouring in after the institute allowed 62 executive MBA (one-year course) students to return to the campus and use the Net facility to attend online classes without any disruption, the official said.Of the 62, six reached the campus on Sunday.The MBA programme office is in touch with parents of the 20 final-year students to decide how and when they might be allowed on the campus. The two-year MBA course has 462 students.“Initially, one or two students had requested. Since the announcement regarding the MBA executive students, the number of requests from final-year MBA students has gone up,” the official said. “The number is likely to go up further.”Hunar Gandhi, IIM-C student council president, had earlier written to director Anju Seth asking if it would be possible to allow some students who may have Net connectivity problems or other difficulties at home to return to the campus and use the institute infrastructure to attend online classes. In the same letter he had said students were apprehensive about the quality of learning in online classes.The MBA students had attended classes on the campus in the first year. The second-year classes have been online so far because of the pandemic.At least 61 of the institute’s 82 teachers had on Saturday written to its board of governors that the digital infrastructure on the campus was in “poor shape”. The executive MBA students will face Net connectivity problems, they said. “We are, therefore, not sure if this decision to bring them to the campus will improve the quality of online education.”The Telegraph could not get in touch with director Seth for her version on the matter.The institute will take the call on allowing the 20 final-year students depending on the success of the plan involving the 62 executive MBA students.",2020-09-15 01:42:00
1383,Sanjay Mandal,"Unlock 4: Five months on, food on board flights - Telegraph India","The flight catering units at Calcutta airport have started preparing meals again after more than five months as airlines have resumed serving food on flights.The Oberoi group’s flight catering unit started loading meals on flights from Sunday, an official of the unit said. Taj Sats Air Catering Ltd, the in-flight catering unit of the Taj group, has started preparing food for passengers again fromSeptember 8.On Sunday, Oberoi Flight Services and Oberoi Airport Services loaded more than 200 boxes of sandwiches and close to 150 packets of pre-booked meals on domestic flights of airlines, including IndiGo and SpiceJet.At one point, it used to provide 4,000 to 5,000 meals every day, an official said.The flight catering unit of the Taj group has been providing close to 750 meals since September 8, mainly to Air India flights. On Monday, it provided close to 2,000 meal boxes to Air India flights because the airline operated two big aircraft to Delhi, the catering unit official said.Before the pandemic, the unit had been provided about 6,000 meals every day, he saidWhile the Oberoi unit serves hot meals for lunch and dinner, the Taj unit provides snacks that include kathi rolls, patties, cakes and biscuits.“The bigger meal boxes that contain kathi rolls, along with other items, are for longer flights to cities like Delhi and Mumbai,” the catering unit official said.The flight catering units became non-functional towards the end of March when commercial planes had stopped flying because of the pandemic. Even after domestic flights and international evacuation flights resumed, the civil aviation ministry hadn’t given permission to serve meals on board because of safety reasons.The Telegraph had in June reported that the Oberoi catering unit had written to the Centre, urging it to allow serving meals on board.“Our factory has been closed since March 20 and there is no revenue. The earnings of several operating companies — especially those in hospitality, aviation and non-grocery retail — have been hit because of business restrictions in the country triggered by the pandemic,” A. Imam Malik, unit head/head-corporate affairs, Oberoi Flight Services and Oberoi Airport Services, had written in an email to the ministry on June 15.“You are earnestly requested to kindly withdraw the restriction on in-flight catering facility to passengers on domestic airlines.”The unit has close to 200 employees. Now, more than 100 have returned to work.Recently, the Centre allowed serving meals on board.“Having meals on board is part of the flying experience. Most passengers are having the meals,” an official of Vistara, a full service carrier, said.The airline has been operating four flights, two each to Mumbai and Delhi, thrice a week.About 30 per cent of passengers on Indigo’s flights out of Calcutta are pre-booking meals while booking tickets, an IndiGo official said.If flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur are allowed to operate daily to Calcutta, the catering units would have more business, according to officials of such units.Now, flights from these cities are allowed thrice a week because the state government has requested the Centre for such an arrangement because of the high number of Covid patients in these cities.On Sunday, 103 flights took off from Calcutta with 16,159 passengers, according to airport officials.These include flights to the six cities. The number of passengers goes down below 10,000 on other days, an official said.",2020-09-15 01:44:00
1384,Monalisa Chaudhuri,28km in 3 hours: traffic crawls on BT Road - Telegraph India,"Barrackpore to EsplanadeDistance: 28kmTravel time: Over three hoursTravelling along BT Road for the tens of thousands of commuters using the road daily has turned from bad to worse in the past few weeks.A repair work on a flyover at Dunlop just when things have been opening up has compounded the problems.Trucks and buses from Dakshineswar in the west had been using the Dunlop flyover to keep the Dunlop crossing clutter-free. Now they can’t do so because of the repair work on the flyover. The result: they are on the road and travel time has gone up.The PWD started structural repairs of the flyover from September, restricting the movement of heavy vehicles on it.Regular commuters listed various problems while speaking to The Telegraph:⚫Too many vehicles compared to the number of cops on BT Road⚫Trucks cripple the traffic flow at the Dunlop crossing⚫Lack of alternatives to BT Road⚫Diversions in the absence of the Tallah bridge⚫Slow-moving vehicles, including cycles, in the middle of the roadSrirup Mukherjee, a professional headed for office in Esplanade, started from Barrackpore around 9.15am on Monday. A journey that used to take him one-and-a-half hours took him more than three hours.“To avoid the rush on BT Road, I took the Kalyani Expressway. But that turned out to be a big mistake. We were stuck in a kilometre-long snarl at the Sodepur junction and then again at the Nimta crossing,” Mukherjee said.Mukherjee and his friend who were travelling together returned to BT Road through Belghoria hoping for better traffic movement. By then, two hours had passed.He reached his office at 12.45pm.Muktesh Gupta, a trader who was in a hurry to reach his MG Road shop, reached two hours later than the scheduled time of appointment with a client. Now that the festive season sale is about to pick up, such delays can prove costly, Gupta said. “After so many months, I had got a good customer from south Calcutta… he wanted to make a bulk purchase. Unfortunately, I reached two hours late for the meeting.”Gupta had started from his Sodepur home around 10am. Most of his time was spent between the Sodepur and the Dunlop crossing he said.Both Gupta and Mukherjee said cops tried to regulate traffic but the volume of vehicles appeared too large to control.The number of vehicles and commuters on BT Road has almost doubled since local trains were suspended, according to officers in the Barrackpore commissionerate.The road is the only option available at present for people from the northern outskirts to reach the heart of the city.Shops and offices have opened. The Tallah bridge and the Dunlop flyover are shut. And all these have aggravated the problem.Some cops blamed autos that sprang to life with the resumption of Metro services for the Monday madness.“Commuters who would wait for buses will now like to use the Metro. This is exactly what happened today,” an officer said. “There was a surge in the number of autos plying till Tobin Road and Dunlop. Most passengers were headed for the Noapara Metro station.”Congestion at the Dunlop crossing is likely to be the biggest challenge to keep the traffic moving during the festive season, according to some officers.Thousands of trucks turn towards the city from the Dunlop crossing. “The time taken by a heavy goods vehicle to turn is at least three times the time taken by a car or other similar four-wheelers. This means, by the time a truck takes a turn, there will be a queue of at least four smaller vehicles on the road. One can imagine the sort of congestion if thousands of trucks move along the stretch,” an officer said.BT Road is the arterial road connecting the city to the northern outskirts and it becomes exceptionally crowded every year during the festive season, police said.“In the absence of local trains, we expect double the pressure this year,” an officer in the Barrackpore commissionerate said.",2020-09-15 01:47:00
1385,Kinsuk Basu ,Dhakuria flyover plan: repair of approaches  - Telegraph India,"The two approaches to the Dhakuria flyover have become undulating making it difficult for vehicles to negotiate the gradient, engineers who conducted a load test on the south Calcutta structure recently have concluded.The flyover has otherwise been found to be structurally stable.To make the ride smoother on both approaches to the flyover — built in 1963 — structural experts and advisers to the state government on bridge safety have decided to first reduce the gradient. Once that is done, the undulating surface on the approaches will be repaired.“The structure is quite old and it would be a challenge to achieve our objective to make the ride smoother on the two approaches. But we will have to find a way,” said a member of the expert committee set up by the state government to look into the health of bridges and flyovers maintained by the state’s urban development department.“There will be three clear benefits once we achieve our goal — vehicular emission will be reduced, operating cost of maintaining vehicles will come down, and wear and tear of tyres will be minimised.”Once the two approaches are repaired, the committee may apply the technique to other flyovers that suffer from the same problem.The pier-less, 380m-long bridge was shut down for two days in July because engineers wanted to test it’s load-bearing capacity.The Dhakuria flyover stands on inclining concrete walls filled with sand or earth. Railway tracks run below an 80m-long section of the bridge.Structural engineers have said the technology used to build the flyover had become dated. “There are no piers holding the flyover. It has concrete walls from bottom to top with soil in the middle. The paved road was built above the soil. This technique has become dated,” said an engineer.A few years back an inspection had revealed that rats had burrowed large holes underneath the flyover. In June 2013, a portion of the walkway on the flyover had collapsed and created a 1.5ft gap, wide enough to raise doubts about the stability of the 57-year-old structure.“There is nothing much to worry about the main structure. There are certain needs for maintenance and it will be carried out,” said an engineer of the urban development department.",2020-09-15 01:51:00
1386,Subhankar Chowdhury,Jadavpur University starts classes for new semester - Telegraph India,"Classes in the new semester for arts and science students at Jadavpur University started on Monday. Compensatory classes to make up for the ones students had missed out on in the previous semester ended on Sunday.Half the classes of the previous semester could not be held because the campus had to be shut down on March 16 as a precaution against Covid-19.An official said the “distance digital mode” was being followed for holding the classes and this entailed making study materials such as notes, soft copies of textbooks, and audio and video demonstrations available to the students through email and WhatsApp.He said teachers could hold live online classes for students with sound Internet connectivity at home.“It is a kind of mixed mode. Live online classes can be arranged for a group sure of Net connectivity. But there has to be a backup plan for those who will miss out on online classes because of connectivity issues. No one should be left out,” the official said.A physics teacher said he held a live online class for 17 students on Monday afternoon. “Two or three students missed five minutes’ lecture because of a snag. For them we uploaded the recorded lectures on a digital platform the university has subscribed to. We will share with them the link to the lecture,” the teacher said.The study materials are also being uploaded on a central repository created on the digital platform.Once the content is uploaded, the addresses of the files — in Word or PDF format, audio notes or video recordings — will be shared with the students.  Pro-vice-chancellor Pradip Ghosh said teachers were free to hold a few more compensatory classes. “We have left it to the teachers,’’ he said.The regular classes will continue till the exams in December.The university has raised more than Rs 20 lakh to buy smartphones and high-speed data packs for the 500-odd students who have poor Net connectivity at home.",2020-09-15 01:52:00
1387,Our Special Correspondent,Three pedestrians killed in three accidents in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Three pedestrians died in three accidents across the city on Monday.Swagata Saha, 55, a resident of Ranaghat, was waiting near a footpath outside a jewellery store in Ultadanga close to the Hudco crossing when a dumper hit her while trying to take a right turn on Monday evening, police said.Saha was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital where she was declared dead.Officers of Maniktala police station said the dumper was moving at high speed and was close to the footpath to the left of the road where the woman was standing when the accident took place.At that time, there were several people on the footpath, most of them waiting for public transport, the police said.The dumper has been seized and the driver detained.The driver does not have a licence and he could be aged below 18, according to the preliminary investigation. The dumper will be sent for a mechanical examination to ascertain if it had developed any technical snag, which led to the accident, the police said.The other two accidents took place in the Sealdah area — one of them on the Sealdah flyover in the evening.A man, whose identity could not be ascertained till late at night, was hit by a private bus on the flyover, the police said.“It appears he had got off another vehicle on the flyover and was trying to cross the road near the flank leading to MG Road. He was hit by a bus while he was crossing the road,” an officer of Muchipara police station said.The bus fled the spot after the accident.Cops are scanning footage of CCTV cameras installed on the flyover to ascertain the identity of the vehicle from which he had got off and that of the bus.“No one is allowed to get off or board any vehicle on the flyover. Had the victim followed the rule, he may have been alive today,” an officer said.The third accident happened in the morning on AJC Bose Road in front of NRS Medical College and Hospital.A woman, who lived on the footpath, was trying to cross the road while the traffic signal was green and was hit by a private bus, the police said.The driver has been arrested on charges of causing death by negligence and rash and negligent driving.According to police records, more than half of the people who die in road accidents in Calcutta are pedestrians.A large number of pedestrian deaths are caused because of encroached and over-crowded footpaths, forcing people to walk or stand on the road, risking their lives.Some pedestrian deaths are a result of lawlessness, the police said.",2020-09-15 01:58:00

People can lodge complaints on the numbers,” the CMC official said. “The civic body has fixed the charge at Rs 5,000.”It is not possible to break down charges based on distance, another CMC official said. “At times, operators have to pick up bodies from New Town or near the airport and take them to Dhapa. If you consider that Rs 5,000 is not unjust.”The CMC has to transport bodies from the Calcutta and Bidhannagar municipal areas.The charge has been fixed at Rs 5,000 because the two personnel in a van need to wear PPEs and the van needs to be sanitised regularly, an official said. “Why will operators provide such service if there is no profit? After a lot of difficulty we managed to convince two hearse van operators to transport Covid bodies.”The CMC’s own hearse vans transport bodies from government hospitals. But there are not enough vans to serve all private hospitals. So, private hospitals have been given the contact details of private hearse van operators. Hospitals are supposed to hand over the numbers to relatives of the dead, the official said.",2020-09-15 02:09:00
1390,Subhankar Chowdhury,Reopen rider for schools during coronavirus crisis - Telegraph India,"Education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Tuesday the government was in no position to tell when schools and colleges could resume in-person classes, given the spread of Covid.On the sidelines of a programme in Behala, where a reporter asked him about the state government’s plans to resume on-campus classes, Chatterjee said: “The schools and colleges will reopen only when the situation becomes normal. As of now, the institutions are closed till September 30. How can you even ask when schools will reopen? Covid cases are still increasing rapidly…. I have no idea how you can open schools now.” The global advisory committee on Covid that the state government has set up is concerned about the situation, Chatterjee said.That committee, helmed by Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, is helping the state formulate strategies to minimise the impact of the pandemic on the economy, said an official of the education department.The Centre’s guidelines allow students of Classes IX to XII to go to school to consult teachers from September 21 with written consent from parents. But a senior state government official said on Tuesday evening: “We have not taken any decision on that yet.”Bengal on Tuesday reported 3,227 Covid-19 cases, 59 deaths and 2,996 recoveries. The total number of cases is over 2.09 lakh. In all, Bengal has had 4,062 Covid deaths till Tuesday.After a 15-day streak of a fall in the number of active cases, which ended on September 8, the state has seen a rise in count for eight consecutive days.The state government’s focus will be on reaching education to students in the absence of in-person classes, the minister said. “There is a need to ensure that studies continue and they are taken within the reach (of students). We will see to it…. If there is a rethink after September 30, we will see,” said Chatterjee.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on July 28 said the state government had set a target to reopen the institutions from September 5 on alternate days if the situation allowed. The plan was not pursued as the situation did not improve.",2020-09-16 03:09:00
1391,Kinsuk Basu ,Durga Puja organisers tweak plans to abide by Mamata Banerjee ’s plea - Telegraph India,"Several Durga Puja organisers have decided to alter their structures to ensure pandals have a bigger space and air circulates freely, conditions that experts say hinder the spread of Covid-19.Throughout Tuesday some of the organisers met their artists and decorators to discuss ways to abide by the advisory issued by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday. They discussed how to go about altering their pandals with less than 40 days to go till the Puja.Some organisers wondered whether the ceiling height of the pandal could be increased, while others pondered over how to build additional gates to ensure the air flow was not hindered.  Organisers who have an open space to erect pandals — like Deshapriya Park and College Square — discussed multiple options, including increasing the overall square feet of the structure to have more space for less visitors. Those who have just a lane or a road to erect pandals — like Nalin Sarkar Street and Kalighat 64 Pally — were planning to suitably modify their themes in keeping with the advisory of the chief minister.Mamata had on Monday said Durga Puja pandals should be open on all sides so that there was free movement of air. “Durga Puja is a big challenge and in Bengal it is a national festival. Let the pandals be kept open so that there is circulation of air,” Mamata had said. “Open thakley hawa batash boibe (If it is open, air will flow). It is for precaution. To be safe.”By Tuesday evening, many of the organisers managed to firm up their alternative plans.“After a long discussion with our decorator we decided to do away with a thakur ghor from this year so that there is more space for air to circulate,” said Kajal Sarkar of Bosepukur Sitala Mandir Puja Committee. “If the chief minister wants so, we have to abide by it.”Some organisers, including Kalighat Milan Sangha and Maddox Square, have similar options.“We will have a space, measuring around 30 feet X10 feet, which will separate visitors from those who will be engaged in rituals in front of the idols. The ceiling height is also being increased. The idea is to have free circulation of air,” said Sandipan Banerjee of Behala Notun Dal puja committee.“There are several ways to tackle the challenge. The usual style of forcing visitors to take zig-zag turns to enter a pandal will have to be done away with,” said Biswanath Dey, a theme artist who is working with at least three big pujas in south Calcutta this time.“Installations before reaching the main idol will have to be removed and where the space is constricted, adjoining houses and buildings can be made to look like a part of the overall concept.”In July, the Forum for Durgostav, an umbrella organisation of about 350 pujas in Calcutta, had agreed on a 17-point code on how to organise the Puja amid all restrictions. One of the codes was that pandals would be constructed in a way so one could see the idol even from a distance.“After the chief minister’s appeal, we have asked all our members to find ways so that air circulation is not hindered in a pandal,” said Saswata Basu, the secretary of Hatibagan Sarbojonin Durgostav Committee and also secretary of the forum.The chief minister is scheduled to meet Puja organisers on September 25.",2020-09-16 03:12:00

The gang had been active in parts of Entally, Phoolbagan and Narkeldanga in the past few weeks.“But in Narkeldanga and Entally, the men themselves were involved… they had gone disguised as beggars,” an officer said.Cops started investigating two thefts in Narkeldanga and Entally last month when they came across CCTV footage that had the same set of male beggars present in the area where the thefts had been reported.The third case was reported in the Phoolbagan police station area.Gold ornaments, expensive utensils, laptops and other electronic devices had been reported stolen in all three locations.“A pattern was emerging. It became clear that the same gang was operating in all these locations,” a detective department officer said.A separate team comprising officers of the detective department’s anti-burglary squad was formed to track down the gang.Investigators got to know that a group of men had been camping on the Sealdah station premises for the past few weeks. Cops learnt that the men would usually send their wives and children to roam around the city and steal valuables from houses and shops whenever they could.Three men were arrested in the Sealdah station area, two of whom were spotted in the CCTV footage of the areas where the thefts had been reported. The police identified them as Shekhar Nag, Indra Singh and Khokon Singh.The station area was raided around 2am on September 12, an officer said. The gang was caught sleeping. There were many men and women and children but only the three were picked up because of the direct evidence, the officer said.Cops have seized gold and silver ornaments, laptops, mobile phones, a camera, and a mobile phone power bank from them.The gang keeps shifting from one place to another. Women with kids in their arms beg during the day.As a part of the modus operandi, women and children beg and steal and the men sell the stolen goods and run their families with the money, the police said.A few months ago, two women from a similar all-women gang had been arrested in Patuli. They had tried to steal valuables from a house in the guise of beggars with children in their arms. One of the women was pregnant, the police said.",2020-09-16 03:15:00

One of the charges is culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which can lead to 10 years in jail.Among the other charges Vikram faces are drink driving and rash and negligent driving. The framing of charges has paved the way for the trial to begin.Vikram was at the wheel of his Toyota Corolla Altis when it crashed into the kerbside along Rashbehari Avenue early on April 29, 2017. Sonika, who police said was seated beside Vikram, died on the spot.The Indian Penal Code sections slapped on Vikram are 304(II), which deals with causing culpable homicide not amounting to murder with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without intention; 279, which relates to rash driving; 338, which is relevant to causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others; and 427, which deals with mischief.Vikram has also been charged under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act, which deals with drink driving.The court retained all the charges filed by the police.During the court proceedings, the public prosecutor had pressed for the charge of murder.Vikram’s lawyer Anirban Guha Thakurta had contested the plea saying the actor had no intention to kill “his friend” and, hence, could not be tried for murder. The court accepted Guha Thakurta’s plea and rejected the murder charge.Vikram is out on bail and has resumed his acting career. Clad in a white shirt, blue jeans and a black mask, he attended the court proceedings on Tuesday.Outside the court, when asked for his reaction, he refused to comment on the proceedings and said he had full faith in his team of lawyers.Sections under which actor Vikram Chatterjee will be tried:",2020-09-16 04:14:00

This is a violation of the Bio Medical Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, 2016.”While yellow bags are supposed to contain infectious anatomical waste and medicines, red bags are meant for contaminated medical waste.Subsequently, the board ordered AMRI to “submit an EC (environmental compensation) of Rs 10 lakh within 10 days” from the date of issue of the board’s letter, which is August 28, 2020.A board official said the hospital had sought a waiver.A spokesperson for AMRI said the government-notified medical waste lifting agency was at fault because it did not clear the Covid medical waste within the stipulated time and that led to the dumping.“We have earlier communicated the problem to the PCB,” the spokesperson said. The hospital has set up a dedicated room to keep medical waste, including PPEs, he said.“They should have done it to start with as per the norms… they cannot pass the buck and blame the agency,”a public health expert said.Satyabala ID hospital, a government unit treating Covid patients, has been fined as it was found during inspection that the “unit has not installed ETP (effluent treatment plant) and was operating without the valid consent” to handle biomedical waste.Earlier people had complained against the hospital for scattering infectious medical waste and PPEs.“We are not in a position to invest in an ETP ourselves and we had referred the matter to higher authorities,” a hospital official said.“We have already sent a letter apologising to the PCB for the violation and promised that there would not be any repetition of such violation,” Bhabani Das, the chief medical officer of health, Howrah, said.",2020-09-16 04:16:00

She was only 13 and a police officer’s daughter.The one-page note said: “I didn’t get good marks though I studied hard cuz (because) all are the best. I am really happy that I am going to die…. But the saddest thing is this that I cannot be a (an) IPS officer.”The teenager’s class teacher said she was an “above average student” and did well in the online test held last week.She scored 20 out of 20 in geography, 19 out of 20 in English and history, and 17 out of 20 in science. The students had been told their marks, the school said.“She was friendly and active in extracurricular activities. It’s shocking that she decided to end her life,” an official of the school said.The only child of her parents, the girl wanted to become a police officer like her father, but of a higher grade.Her mother was home while her father was on duty when the girl killed herself. A man who was parking a scooter in the compound heard a loud thud behind him. As he turned around, he saw the girl lying in a pool of blood.Amherst Street police station, which is in the same compound, was alerted almost immediately.The girl’s mother told the police that her daughter was fiddling with her mobile phone minutes before she jumped to her death. “We have evidence that she jumped from the top floor,” said an officer.",2020-09-16 04:18:00
1396,Our Special Correspondent,Jadavpur University teacher dead - Telegraph India,"The former dean of arts at Jadavpur University, Subhasis Biswas, who had tested positive for Covid, died early on Tuesday.Biswas, 49, was admitted to a private hospital last Wednesday after he took ill at his home in Garfa.The history professor was put on a ventilator on Monday.Biswas’s tenure as dean ended in June 2019. In August 2018, he had resigned from the post of dean, head of the history department and convener of the admissions committee following complaints that many students who had scored 90 per cent or more in the Plus II board exams had been given 10 out of 100 or less in the university’s admissions test.Some of the prospective students had moved court. He had later withdrawn his resignation. After his tenure ended as dean, he continued as a professor in the history department.",2020-09-16 04:23:00
1397,Snehal Sengupta,Building plan telecom terms - Telegraph India,"Developers building housing complexes, commercial buildings and offices in New Town have to provide details in building plans about space allotted to set up telecom and Internet infrastructure, an official of the New Town Kolkata Development Authority said.Builders have to specify where they want to keep space for mobile phone towers and power generating units, among others, in their building plans, the official said.This has been done as several communities in the township’s three action areas have reported low network areas or shadow areas.The problem is not limited not only to New Town. Several Calcuttans face the problem of sketchy network and low data speed.Several residents and housing communities across the city have fixed repeater access points and network boosters haphazardly in empty places without any prior planning, the NKDA official said.These boosters are often installed illegally, the official said. “Most residents who don’t get proper network coverage are using boosters… they buy them themselves or ask local technicians to do so. These devices are not fixed by service providers.”Vinita Agarwal, 34, who stays in New Town’s Action Area II, said she had to ask a local technician to fix a network booster because she barely got any network in her house and faced problems while working from home.“I have been working from home during the lockdown… and I have faced major network problems. For days I had no network and we called a technician who suggested we get a booster installed. When we asked him for one he suggested another man’s name… that person came and installed it the next day. I paid Rs 2,000. Now we have much better network and decent data speed,” Agarwal said.Debashis Sen, the NKDA chairman, said many people were working from homes and most students were studying online. This has brought to the fore the shortcomings of a weak network in New Town, he said. In order to identify shadow zones where the broadband reach is poor, the NKDA has decided to conduct a house-to-house survey.“The survey will be done quickly by a competent agency after an expression of interest. Special attention will be given by Hidco and NKDA to see how a Rapid Action Connection can be achieved by putting in additional resources. The places with poor Net connectivity is worrying. Several residents have complained to us,” Sen said.The building plans must have details of spaces allocated to set up telecom infrastructure in order to get the plans passed, he said.It will be made mandatory as are electrical and mechanical plans that include where space for AC units, ducts, fire pumps and various electrical utilities, he said.",2020-09-16 04:25:00
1398,Jhinuk Mazumdar,"In coronavirus crisis, interest-free loans by an NGO - Telegraph India","Shankar Paswan ran a roadside sindoor stall in the Kalighat area before he had to shut up shop because of the lockdown. He used up his capital, borrowed money from lenders and survived on rations.Customers started returning but Paswan had no capital to restart his business. He needed Rs 3,000.Siliya Debi needed Rs 2,000 to restart the tea stall she had been running in Hazra for more than 15 years. It is no mean sum for her to arrange with grandchildren at home to feed.Calcutta Social Project, an NGO that has been working with women and children for almost five decades have decided to provide interest-free loans to such vendors to help them restart their businesses during the pandemic.The idea is not to give them donations or grants but let them remain “self-respecting vendors”, Arjun Dutta, the president of Calcutta Social Project, said. “They have to repay as and when they are able to.”The NGO will provide loans ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 7,000.The thought of giving loans came after speaking to food aid beneficiaries whom the NGO has been providing with ration during the lockdown, Dutta said.“We realised there are so many small independent people who have been reduced to being destitute… dependents on our charity… who have lost their security, self-respect and sustainability,” he said.“We have started identifying such people and restoring their businesses by helping them with funds. We will do this for small operators and they will repay when they can… the time can be decided when the loan is disbursed.”The NGO has formed a panel for the livelihood loans programme to “identify genuine people in need of help”.Those who have been given loans are not being left to themselves. Volunteers from the NGO are tracking their progress, Dutta said.On Tuesday, Paswan reopened his shop after more than six months. He went to Burrabazar on Monday to buy sindoor and shades with the Rs 3,000 he received. He has kept aside some for further investments. “During the lockdown I was forced to take a loan of Rs 5,000 from a lender at an interest rate of 10 per cent. He has been after me for the money…. but how could I repay with no source of income till now?”Till Tuesday afternoon he had earned only Rs 20 unlike the pre-lockdown days when he used to make Rs 300 a day on average. “People are trickling in... at least I have been able to restart my business,” he said.The NGO has given donors the option of directly funding beneficiaries on its list, Dutta said.",2020-09-16 04:29:00
1399,Subhankar Chowdhury,Rs 5 lakh from Jadavpur University alumna to bridge gap - Telegraph India,"A Jadavpur University alumna who taught at the university for 36 years donated Rs 5 lakh to her alma mater to help it buy smartphones and data packs for poor students facing Net connectivity problems.Krishna Roy, 79, a resident of Jatin Bagchi Road in south Calcutta, had done her PhD from the university. She did not bother about the possible health risk and came to Aurobindo Bhavan — the university’s administrative headquarters — on Monday to hand over the cheque.The former head of the philosophy department had retired in 2006. During her stay on the campus she had seen many students grappling with financial problems, she said.The septuagenarian found it an “irresistible call” when she got to know of the university’s fundraising drive to build a corpus to help poor students with smartphones and high-speed data packs.“Scores of poor students study at JU. They cannot afford such a device or Net connectivity that is a must to attend online classes. When I got to know that vice-chancellor Suranjan Das has requested all to raise funds to help disadvantaged students, I found the call irresistible,” Roy said.In August, Das had requested university teachers and other employees to donate a day’s salary and the alumni, guardians and others to contribute and help raise money to provide students with smartphones and high-speed data packs so that they can overcome the digital divide and attend classes.Roy who had graduated from Jogomaya Devi College believes in the joy of giving.Last year, she had donated Rs 5 lakh to an organisation that works to help those in distress. “I am a pensioner. Whatever I draw I consider adequate for my sustenance. When my alma mater is going to unparalleled lengths to tide over the digital divide, I thought I would do as much to support the initiative,” Roy said.On Monday, she had met Gour Krishna Pattanayak, the finance officer of JU. He took her to the vice-chancellor’s office. “I had heard about Suranjan babu but hadn’t got any opportunity to meet him. Considering that virtual education is the way forward during the pandemic, what he has been doing is laudable,” Roy said.“I am touched by the Krishna Roy’s gesture. At a time like this when everybody is busy saving for himself or herself, wary of what is going to unfold, this gesture of giving stands out,” VC Das said. “It will help us ensure no one is left out for want of Net connectivity.”Some former mechanical engineering students have donated Rs 1.95 lakh to the corpus.Ananda Sengupta, a former student from the mechanical engineering department who, like VC Das, is from South Point School, played a key role in raising the fund.A survey on Net connectivity, conducted by the university, has shown 110 students need smartphones and 400-odd students need high-speed data packs.Classes for the new semester in arts and science have started from September 14 and the university has started the process of buying phones and data packs.",2020-09-16 04:30:00
1400,Sanjay Mandal,Covid shadow on cooking gas demand - Telegraph India,"Domestic LPG consumption in and around Calcutta has dipped over the past few months because of Covid-19, a number distributors of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said.Many distributors said the demand for refilled domestic LPG cylinders had gone down by more a thousand a month in their respective zones. A message from the IOC with a request to drive up sales reached distributors through WhatsApp this week.“Dear All Distributors: Industry growth in the month is 2 percent whereas growth of North 24-Pgs (-)10.5 percent, Kolkata (-)3 percent, South Kolkata (-) 2.23 percent. Pls come up. Check last 3 months’ refill data. Put your showroom staff and delivery man on the job for booking and delivery to these customers,” said one message.“Above negative growth in these three districts are of IOCL, ie of Kolkata AO (area office) ...,” the second message read.A senior IOC official, however, denied any drop in demand. “It’s true that the growth has stagnated for the last few months in and around Calcutta compared with the districts. But I don’t think there is a drop in refills,” said the official.The company had in July sent mails to the distributors in the city, informing them that several had registered negative growth in supplying refilled domestic LPG cylinders.According to the distributors, many of whom said they had sent their employees and delivery personnel to homes where refill demands have gone down to find out the reason, there are several factors for the dip.Many people who were staying on rent in Calcutta and surrounding areas, and working in private companies, shops, stores and other places, have lost their jobs following the Covid-related lockdown, which had brought business to a halt. Most of them have returned to their native places and, hence, are not booking refilled cylinders in the city.Many others have had their incomes drastically reduced and cut down costs, including those incurred on cooking.At many households cooks are not coming because they stay in suburbs and cannot commute to the city as train service has not yet resumed. Such families are either getting food from outside or cooking much less than their hired cooks used to, resulting in a slump in the LPG demand.Another reason for the LPG demand taking a hit is that many students and others who stayed as paying guests in the city have returned home because of Covid. Their landlords now have to cook much less.A homemaker at Jodhpur Park said their cooking gas consumption had gone down. “We are asking the cook to come every third day and she is cooking a dish that lasts three days. Earlier, she would come daily,” the homemaker said.“So, our LPG requirement has gone down from one every two months to one every two-and-a-half months. In fact, for the period when the cook was sent on leave, a cylinder lasted for even a longer duration because we used to cook on low flame and were careful to switch off when the ingredients were not ready, which a cook usually does not do,” she said.   “There has been a sharp dip in refill orders for domestic LPG across Calcutta and the suburbs, which we think is a direct impact of Covid-19. This is in addition to the sharp dip in sales of commercial LPG cylinders because hotels and restaurants were closed for a long time. Many people are not ordering for refills at intervals which they would earlier do,” said Bijan Behari Biswas, president, Indane Distributors’ Association, West Bengal.Biswas said many of those who are in the BPL category and have been given money in advance by the Centre to get three cylinders free because of the pandemic are not booking refills. “Many of these consumers have spent the money on other things. So they are yet to take all the three refills that they are entitled to,” said Biswas.Sreema Indane Distributor in Garia has about 22,000 consumers. For the last five to six years, the agency had been supplying 14,000 to 14,500 refilled cylinders every month. Since July, the number has gone down to 11,000.“We have asked many delivery personnel not to come to work because of the fewer orders,” said Sunil Baran Dey, proprietor of Sreema Indane Distributor. “People don’t have money in hand and are trying to cut costs as much as possible.”",2020-09-16 04:31:00
1401,Our Special Correspondent,Kolkata Metro pass relief for senior citizens - Telegraph India,"Metro trains ferried a little over 27,000 people on the Noapara-Kavi Subhash (New Garia) route on Tuesday, a jump of 7,000 over the previous day when the carrier had resumed commercial service for all following the Covid-induced suspension.On Tuesday, Metro announced that “senior citizens” (60 years and above) would be able to enter stations without e-passes from 11.30am to 4.30pm. The first and last trains leave the terminal stations at 8am and 7pm, respectively.Senior citizens have to bring an identity proof — PAN card, Aadhaar card, driving licence, passport or voter card — to enter the station and will need a smart card to board a train. The tech barrier had prevented many aged people from availing themselves of the service and most of the seats reserved for senior citizens on trains were vacant on Monday and Tuesday.“Many senior citizens might have problems in getting familiar with the technology of booking e-passes. They can now enter Metro stations by showing an identity proof,” Metro spokesperson Indrani Banerjee said on Tuesday.Metro officials said 27,100 passengers travelled by Metro on Tuesday, compared with 20,000 the day before.Around 57,000 passes were booked on Tuesday, compared with the 53,000-odd on Monday, said the developer of the e-pass technology. An e-pass is needed for entry into a Metro station and a smart card for boarding a train.“The gap between bookings and actual trips will come down gradually,” said a Metro official.Like the previous day, the morning and evening office hours saw queues at some stations, most notably Dum Dum and Tollygunge, on Tuesday.From 9am to noon, the queue at Tollygunge kept getting longer every time a new slot was approaching. The 8am to 8pm operations have been divided into 12 one-hour slots.Around 9.55am, there were over 50 people in the queue. Around 10.40am, Metro tried booking a pass for the 11am-noon slot but none was available.Several passengers were yet to get familiar with the system of booking passes. Across stations, there were people seeking help from Railway Protection Force and police personnel for booking a pass. Around 10.15am at Tollygunge, a civic volunteer who seemed well versed with the system was surrounded by at least 10 passengers who sought her help.One of them was Durgacharan Dutta, who sells card-swiping machines for a private bank. The Bansdroni resident saw the civic volunteer helping others in booking passes and approached her for help. Dutta, however, could not find a pass for the 10am-noon slot and booked one for the next slot.“It’s okay. The system is new and people will take time to adjust. But Metro resumption is a big help. Riding a scooter from Tollygunge to Dalhousie takes over 40 minutes. An air-conditioned Metro ride takes half the time,” he said.In the evening, scores of passengers were seen trying to book passes outside Dum Dum, Esplanade, Park Street and Tollygunge stations.",2020-09-16 04:34:00
1402,Subhajoy Roy,Patchwork to cover potholes before Durga Puja - Telegraph India,"Damaged roads in the city will get a coat of patchwork before Durga Puja and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has asked all agencies to complete the work by October 15, a civic official said.Repairs before Durga Puja are an annual affair — one of the two times in a year when battered roads get somewhat healed. This year, though, this will be the first repair for many roads. No repair could be carried out before the monsoon because of the lockdown, the official said.The patchwork will provide a temporary cover to craters and potholes on roads. Such repairs do not last beyond a few months, according to civic engineers. It is even less if it rains.“All agencies who maintain roads in Calcutta were present at a meeting on Tuesday where it was decided to carry out the repairs. They have been asked to complete the repairs by October 15,” a CMC official who was present at the meeting said.“Besides the CMC, officials from the public works department, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, the irrigation department and the Calcutta Port Trust were present at the meeting.”People have WhatsApped pictures of various potholed roads to Firhad Hakim (8335988888), the chairman of the CMC’s board of administrators.Police, too, have sent a list of roads where repairs are necessary and one more list is awaited. The traffic guards are preparing one more such list that will be given to the CMC, a police officer said.A 150m stretch of the Garia-bound flank from Calcutta International School to the Ruby crossing is in poor state, Chandan Banerjee, a New Garia resident, said.Banerjee takes the Bypass every day to reach his office near Esplanade. There are multiple craters and cars often brake suddenly to avoid a crater, raising the chance of the vehicle behind to crash into it, he said. “It is all the more difficult for two-wheelers and things worsen if it rains. Visibility drops during heavy rain and trying to negotiate a crater is risky.”At Tuesday’s meeting, an embargo was imposed on any project that will lead to digging roads from October 1 till Kali Puja, a CMC official said.All agencies will have a lot to do because many roads were not repaired before the monsoon, a CMC engineer said. The period between March and May is used to repair roads as this is a dry phase. But skilled hands were unavailable and moving material was difficult because of the lockdown. As a result, little work could be done, the engineer said.“There will be more work this year than previous years. There is already a backlog of roads that could not be repaired… the rain has further worsened their condition. So, carrying out repairs will be more difficult,” he said.Also, patchwork has its own disadvantages. It doesn’t stay for long. The friction caused by the movement of vehicles wears away the repairs within a few months. If it rains, the life of a patchwork gets further shortened, the engineer said.",2020-09-16 04:36:00
1403,Our Bureau,"Cabbie makes lewd gesture at Mimi Chakraborty, arrested - Telegraph India","Actor-turned-MP Mimi Chakraborty was allegedly stalked and subjected to lewd gestures by a taxi driver near Ballygunge Phari while she was returning home in her car on Monday afternoon.Mimi, who did not have her guards with her, ensured that her vehicle blocked the taxi’s way before she stepped out and held the accused by his collar.The driver was allowed to go as the blocked thoroughfare was causing traffic snarls. But the vehicle was identified and the driver arrested later at night.The driver, identified as Deba Yadav, 32, was arrested from his Panchannagram home.Yadav has been booked under the charges of outrage of modesty of a woman, stalking and outrage of a woman through words and gestures. If convicted, he could be jailed for five years.Yadav has been remanded in police custody till September 20.The actor was on her way home to Kasba around 1.30pm when she noticed the driver of a yellow taxi staring at her. “Then I saw him winking at me. I thought it was a tic and ignored it. The taxi then overtook my car and the driver started making lewd gestures at me. Although I was alone (without security), I had to stop the taxi. My car (she had a driver) came to a stop in front of that taxi,” Mimi told Metro on Tuesday.“It was raining heavily… I came out of my car and confronted him (the taxi driver). I shook him by the collar and taught him a good lesson. A crowd started to gather… traffic was coming to a halt… so I had to let him go and he sped away. I had the belief that the administration would catch hold of him and that is what has happened. By night he was caught,” she said.Despite the rain and the Covid pandemic, Mimi stepped out of the car and confronted the man. She could have noted the number and gave it to the police.Why did she get out of the car? “That was my responsibility as a citizen and that is what I did. I just knew if I didn’t put a stop to this, he might mistreat another woman the next day. He was drinking and driving. He is a taxi driver… women get into his cab with the belief that he will ferry them home safely. How safe will they feel? So I had to take that step,” said Mimi, who lodged an FIR.“It is very important that a woman raises her voice and protests. There are hundreds of such cases that go unreported because many women cannot muster the courage to protest,” said an officer in Lalbazar.",2020-09-16 04:37:00
1404,"Subhajoy Roy, Snehal Sengupta",Covid: Low-key Vishwakarma Puja looms - Telegraph India,"The puja that heralds autumn festivities in Calcutta’s calendar has taken a hit.Some organisers have cancelled Thursday’s Vishwakarma Puja, while the ones going ahead with the puja have planned to keep the affairs low key, bereft of the pomp of previous years. Lack of cash is the main reason but concerns about large gatherings amid the Covid pandemic have also made some organisers scrap the usual mutton-rice feast and only stick to the rituals.Arjun Singh, a real estate developer, used to organise a feast for 600 people on the occasion of Vishwakarma Puja at his office. His friends, business competitors and many others would be invited to the feast. This year only his employees and the masons who work for him have been invited.“Real estate sales have slumped badly. I had paid my employees over the past six months though my income was very low. How could I have organised Vishwakarma Puja on the same scale as previous years?” Singh asked. Harideb Sarkar, who runs a unit that manufactures iron grilles and wrought iron beds, has not invited anyone other than his employees and their families to the puja at his factory. “Orders from new flats have reduced significantly and it is no longer possible to spend lavishly on puja,” he said. With businesses reeling under the slump that set in with the Covid pandemic, cutting costs has become an essential survival tactic.For Vishwakarma Pujas organised by transport unions, subscription rates have been reduced as both employees and owners are taking less money back home, transport workers said. The union of autorickshaws that ply between Garia and Gariahat is known for organising a fairly big Vishwakarma Puja. Till last year, over 1,600 people used to be fed over two days on the occasion. On the puja day, bhog would be distributed. The second day was reserved for a “non-veg feast”. This year the second day’s feast has been cancelled. “An autorickshaw driver used to take home Rs 500 daily. That has now come down to Rs 200. The income of vehicle owners has dipped, too,” said Debraj Ghosh, a union leader.The union has lowered the subscription from Rs 101 to Rs 51 for auto owners and from Rs 31 to Rs 21 for drivers. Indologist Nrisinghaprasad Bhaduri said no instance of the puja of Lord Vishwakarma could be found in the Vedas or the Puranas. The festival seems a more recent phenomenon, which followed the advent of industries set up by the British. “Vishwakarma Puja is more or less organised on September 17. This practice of organising the puja on a particular date of the calendar the British follows creates a suspicion that the occasion was aimed at granting masons, carpenters and other workers a day of celebration,” he said. Vishwakarma Puja has a social aspect as well. It is one festival where employers never shy away from funding a festivity to be enjoyed mostly by employees. “The employer comes for the puja, stays with employees for some time and then leaves. The employees immerse themselves in the freedom of the carnival. The employer does not stay for long but will never refuse to fund. This has been the culture of Vishwakarma Puja over the years,” Bhaduri said. 
The decline of industry in Bengal came as a big blow to Viswakarma, the god of craftsmen.Artisans at Kumartuli have received orders for small idols from many of their old customers who bought taller idols in previous years. Gouranga Pal could sell seven large idols, which are 9ft tall, till Wednesday evening, a pale figure compared with last year when he sold as many as 20 such idols. Realtor Vivek Ruia said more than the money, he was worried about a large assembly on his premises. Usually, he has around 250 guests but not this time. From a gala at a building site, it is now a small ritual inside an office.",2020-09-17 02:08:00
1405,Sanjay Mandal,Durga Puja Covid duty plan for doctors - Telegraph India,"Puja holidays are likely to be scrapped for doctors and other employees at several of Calcutta’s private hospitals in order to be prepared if the festival season records a spike in Covid-19 cases. Usually, private hospitals in the city operate with around 40 per cent staff during Durga Puja, extending till Lakshmi Puja. Many doctors go on a holiday during the period.Officials of several private hospitals said this time they were planning to ask all doctors, nurses, paramedics and other employees not to take leave for the entire festive season.On Thursday, Bengal reported 3,237 Covid-19 cases. The number of cases till Thursday in the state touched 2,12,383. Many private hospitals fear it would be a challenge to run hospitals like now during the Puja but their big hope is that most senior doctors would not go on a holiday because of safety issues and uncertainty over international flights. Peerless Hospital this week sent a communication to all employees, appealing to them not to take leave during the Puja. The AMRI Hospitals authorities held a meeting with senior officials recently, asking them to be on duty for the entire festival week.Others are trying to prepare rosters for the Puja with as many healthcare personnel as possible.For the past several years, most private hospitals had 50 per cent occupancy during the festive period. Mostly emergency patients, including accident victims, would be admitted during the period.Planned surgeries and procedures are not scheduled for the festive month as most doctors are not available and patients, too, want to enjoy the festive spirit without the worry of visiting hospital. Most hospitals keep their outpatient departments closed from Saptami till Lakshmi Puja. But the Covid-19 pandemic has changed everything. “Earlier, during the Puja, we would have less than 200 patients, This time, of the 350 beds, 150 have been reserved for Covid patients. On Thursday, all Covid beds were occupied,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital. The hospital has appealed to its 2,000-odd employees, including doctors on the payroll and 150 consultants, not to take leave during the Puja. “We are fearing Covid-19 patients would need admission even during the Puja and we need to be prepared for that. Managing 200 patients in the pre-Covid times and treating 150 Covid patients are different,” Mitra said. One of the biggest problems is having separate teams of doctors, nurses and other personnel for Covid and non-Covid wards. “Even those washing linens cannot be spared. For Covid beds, fresh linens are needed every day to control infection,” he said.“We have held a meeting with officials and they have agreed to be on duty during the Puja. Now, we have to speak to the doctors and request them to be available during the festive period because of the pandemic,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. The hospital’s Salt lake unit is now a Covid treatment centre.The Narayana Health group, which runs the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and two hospitals in Howrah, keeps its OPDs closed on the festive days. But this time they are planning to keep them open. “It is our endeavour to keep our OPDs and fever clinics open and perform planned procedures/ surgeries, apart from emergency services during the Puja. We will meet our doctors, nurses and support service team…” said R. Venkatesh, director, eastern region, Narayana Health.The CEO of a hospital said it would be difficult to keep the nurses from Bengal on duty during the festive season. Others are concerned, too.“It will be tough to prepare the Puja roster keeping all operations like other times of the year, as well as giving leave to people,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO, Belle Vue Clinic.But officials of many hospitals said they were banking on the possibility that most senior doctors would be reluctant to go on a holiday during the festive period because of the Covid scare and uncertainty over international flights.“I had plans to visit my daughter in the UK during the Puja. But now there is no question of going,” said surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay.",2020-09-17 02:31:00
1406,Mita Mukherjee,ICSE council rethink after Bengal government stand - Telegraph India,"The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has notified its schools on partial reopening for students seeking guidance with parental consent from September 21 but the council may reconsider the approach in Bengal after the state government said schools should stay shut at least till September 30.The CISCE on Wednesday sent the schools the notification on the partial reopening and suggested that the time be utilised to make up for lost classes on “project” and “practical” work.On the same day, the Bengal government said that schools in the state would not reopen at least till September 30.Gerry Arathoon, the council chief executive and secretary, told Metro on Wednesday evening: “We will soon hold a meeting (to discuss Bengal).” A fresh notification may be “issued in a day or two” specifically for Bengal.“It is not possible for students who will appear in the ICSE and ISC exams next year to do practical work at home. So, when the ministry of home affairs issued the guidelines, we decided to enable students to do some practice in practical work,” Arathoon said.The Union home ministry had issued guidelines last month saying students from Classes IX to XII could be permitted to visit school from September 21 with written consent from guardians to take guidance from teachers.Earlier in the day, Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee told this newspaper that all educational institutions in the state would be kept closed at least till September 30, as announced by the state government.“I am not aware about the ICSE council’s decision…. Our government had announced that all educational institutions in the state will remain closed till September 30. There is no change in the decision,” Chatterjee said.On Tuesday, Chatterjee had said the state government was in no position to tell when schools and colleges could resume in-person classes, given the spread of Covid.The council in its notification has advised the schools to enable students, particularly those appearing in the Class X and XII board exams, to do practical on prescribed topics in school laboratories as the “hands on” practical work could not be performed earlier because of the pandemic and the lockdown. “Hands-on practical work could not be carried out earlier... The schools are advised to utilise this period to perform sufficient practical work in the laboratories, as per the topics mentioned in the reduced syllabus. Thereafter, some of the practical work may be graded and the marks recorded,” the notification says.The schools have also been advised by the CISCE to utilise the partial reopening to complete project work and ensure the projects are submitted to the subject teachers by a deadline.The notifications advised  “affiliated schools to perform the following activities: Completion of the project work…. Practice and completion of practical work”.",2020-09-17 02:49:00
1407,"Tapas Ghosh, Our Bureau",Covid victim body to be handed to kin: Calcutta High Court - Telegraph India,"The high court on Wednesday directed the state government to hand over bodies of Covid victims to their nearest kin so they can perform the last rites.The division bench of Chief Justice T.B.N. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee framed guidelines after considering the Centre’s norms for cremation of bodies of Covid victims by family members.The order says: “When post-mortem of the dead body is not required, the dead body shall be handed over to the immediate next of kin of the deceased, that is the parents/ surviving spouse/ children, after completion of hospital formalities.“The body should be secured in a bag, the face and end of which should be preferably transparent and exterior of which will be appropriately sanitised so as to eliminate/ minimise the risk to the people transporting the dead body.”Family members and acquaintances will accompany the body to the crematorium/burial ground straight from the hospital.According to the court’s guidelines, the face and end of the bodybag “may be unzip-ped by a staff at the crematorium or burial ground to allow the relatives to see the body for the last time. At this time, religious rituals, such as reading from religious groups, sprinkling of holy water, offering grains and other last rites that do not require touching of the body should be allowed.”If a family does not claim a body, the government will have the right to cremate it, the court said.According to previous norms, the family could come to the hospital and have a last look at the body during a 30-minute window. The body wrapper is transparent in the upper part, which makes the face visible.Two family members can go to the crematorium or burial ground but that rarely happens since the immediate family is mostly in quarantine, a Calcutta Mu-nicipal Corporation official said.In the early stages of the pandemic, families were not allowed to see the bodies.The petitioner in the case, Vineet Ruia, had alleged that the government was not handing over the bodies to family members “only to suppress the figure of total deaths from the disease”.The state government has yet to decide whether they will challenge the high court’s judgment in the Supreme Court.“We are yet to receive any instruction from the state health department whether to challenge the order,” a senior government lawyer said in the evening.",2020-09-17 03:08:00
1408,"Snehal Sengupta, Debraj Mitra","Don’t harm tigers, Bengal forest department tells villagers in Sundarbans - Telegraph India","Forest department officials have held meetings with panchayat pradhans, members of joint forest management committee members and villagers from the Sunderbans and asked them not to harm tigers if they spot one.Tempers are frayed in the region after three men got killed in tiger attacks in the Jhila forest area.Anger is simmering as villagers and fishermen believe a single tiger has been attacking them, a forest official said. Villagers have asked forest officials to “do something” about the tiger, the official said.Forest officials have told representatives of fishermen and villagers that all the three men who had been attacked had moored their boats and were on the banks of the muddy creeks, either laying crab nets or cooking.“We told them not to get off of their boats. Fishermen are not allowed nor are they supposed to go anywhere near the creeks or channels in the Sunderbans,” an official said.Thousands who hail from the Sunderbans have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and have returned to their villages. But farms and ponds inundated were left with saline water in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan.A large number of villagers have been venturing deep into tiger territory to catch crabs and fish.Some fishermen have told the forest officials at the meeting: “It is our right to fish wherever there is water.”The idea can set a dangerous precedent to man-animal conflict in the region, an official said.The Sunderbans tiger reserve field director Tapas Das said forest officials had asked villagers who go out to fish not to get off their boats and lay nets on the banks of creeks to catch crabs or cook food. “They are not supposed to enter narrow creeks. We have asked them not to enter them at any cost.”The lure of crabs is a strong pull as earnings are higher than fishing, another forest official said.Tigers in the Sunderbans region face multiple difficulties while hunting their regular prey that includes deer and wild boar among others because of the muddy terrain and exposed roots of mangroves that act like thorns and prick their paws, Das said.“Humans are easier to attack and more so when somebody moors the boat and gets on land. We asked the village heads to ensure this is stopped,” he said.The forest department is thinking of imparting vocational training and setting up poultry farms and small fishery projects as a means of alternative livelihood for fishermen.Apart from the meeting, the forest department has started boat patrols near the Jhila forest and daily 10 boats carrying forest officials and villagers have been patrolling the channels and creeks along Jhila 2, Jhila 4 and Jhila 6 forests.In Jhila 6, a 57-year-old man was killed by a tiger while preparing lunch. Two other fishermen were killed on September 3 and 4.",2020-09-17 03:15:00
1409,Sanjay Mandal,Covid: Non-chartered foreign flight lands in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The first non-chartered international flight since the Bengal government lifted restrictions landed in and took off from Calcutta on Wednesday. The government had imposed the curbs as a precaution against Covid.The Emirates airline flight from Dubai arrived with 179 passengers in the morning under an air-transport-bubble arrangement, said airport officials. It took off for Dubai with 110 passengers. The state government had given a no-objection certificate for the flight a week before.Several airlines are applying for no-objection certificates to operate flights under air transport-bubble arrangements (temporary arrangements between two countries to restart commercial passenger flights because regular flights are suspended). SpiceJet will operate a flight between Calcutta and Dubai on Thursday, an official said. The airline has several other flights on the route planned for this month. Emirates has planned at last two more Dubai-Calcutta flights this month. Airport sources said IndiGo was planning to operate a flight to and from Singapore in the last week of September. Air India's first of the several Calcutta-London direct flights under the Vande Bharat evacuation programme is scheduled for Thursday. In July, the Bengal government had asked the civil aviation ministry to stop evacuation flights from international destinations after hundreds of passengers refused to go to a paid quarantine centre after landing in Calcutta and went home instead.Any flight from abroad needs a no-objection certificate from the state government.Later, the government eased the restrictions and allowed chartered flights from abroad to arrive in Calcutta. Earlier this month, the state government, following appeals from airlines and travel operators, started giving approvals for evacuation as well as air-transport-bubble flights. The 179 passengers who arrived in Calcutta on the Emirates flight had tested negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before the journey. “All arriving passengers will have to undergo home quarantine for 14 days,” said an airport official. Those boarding the Dubai-bound flight from Calcutta got their tests done, too. The Boeing 777 aircraft that Emirates operated can carry 360 passengers but India’s directorate general of civil aviation has restricted the number of passengers to 225.SpiceJet has a good number of bookings for its Calcutta-Dubai flight, officials said.“Already, we have 182 passengers booked from Dubai and 135 from Calcutta for Thursday’s flight. We have got the NOC from the state government. More flights to Dubai are scheduled for September 24 and 26,” said Debjit Ghosh, sales head (east), SpiceJet.Tour operators said they were having good bookings for the flights. ""Mostly people who want to join work and students are booking seats,"" said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.",2020-09-17 03:16:00
1410,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus outbreak: Website for Durga pujas of the world - Telegraph India,"A website was launched at Sovabazar Rajbari on Wednesday that promises to bring together Durga pujas in the city and the districts, outside the state and even outside the country.“DurgaFest.com will be a global digital aggregator of Durga puja. We are inviting all pujas to join us and archive their images year on year. So while it serves its immediate purpose by giving home-bound people amid the Covid pandemic a glimpse of this year’s Puja, it will also have a long-term use,” said Shreyasi Paul, a co-founder of the website.The website has been divided into zones of the city, rest of Bengal, rest of India, abroad and aristocratic households. “We have already tied up with over 200 pujas. More are in the pipeline,” Paul said.Work on the website started when Covid was just breaking out in India. “Since the World Health Organisation was forecasting a long haul before the virus would recede, we started planning ahead for Puja,” Paul said.Minister Shashi Panja, the chief guest at the inauguration, said: “When they came up with the idea, I encouraged them thinking that this would be helpful not just for those in the city not venturing out this year but also those who are stuck away from Bengal. I have asked them to provide recordings of each important ritual as a highlight package on a daily basis so that people do not miss the festivity.”“We have little idea or record of how Durga puja was 100 years ago. But such a website will leave a digital footprint of how Durga puja was celebrated, for instance, in the year of the pandemic. They are also accepting older pictures of the respective pujas to archive,” said Debashis Sen, the chairman-cum-managing director of the Housing & Infrastructure Development Corporation, which is supporting the initiative.The DurgaFest.com team also plans to include an account from each organiser of how this year’s puja will be different from other years. Visitors can even rate the puja on the basis of the information and the visuals provided.“This year, it will not be possible to allow visitors into the house. So we will encourage people to watch our puja on electronic and satellite media which will get restricted access,” said Debasish Krishna Deb, a member of the Sovabazar Rajbari, where the launch took place.Nine special covers will be released on each day of Navratri, from October 17 to 25, by the department of posts, West Bengal circle, to commemorate nine manifestations of Durga.The Forum for Durgostav, an umbrella organisation of over 300 Puja committees in Calcutta, will give Rs 4,000 each to 65 artisans in Kumartuli on Thursday to help them tide over the financial crisis resulting from lack of enough orders for idols.",2020-09-17 03:21:00
1411,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus outbreak: Police to monitor Covid norm for tarpan - Telegraph India,"A team of police officers will be deployed at each of the 37 Hooghly ghats from early on Thursday to ensure social distancing is followed when visitors turn up to perform the ritual of tarpan on the occasion of Mahalaya.Each team will be split into two — one will make continuous announcements from loudhailers spreading awareness about the need to maintain distancing amid the Covid pandemic and the other will try and restrict the number of visitors to the ghat.“Masks will be mandatory for all visitors,” an officer said.Tarpan is a ritual of offering water and sesame seeds to departed ancestors and is performed on Mahalaya, at the end of Pitri Paksha. Every year, lakhs of people turn up at the ghats along the Hooghly to perform the ritual.“Elaborate arrangements have been made to ensure the social distancing norm is followed. Teams from the disaster management group will be deployed at the ghats. There will be nets in some of the bigger ghats to ensure visitors don’t stray further into the water while taking a dip,” said Syed Waquar Raza, deputy commissioner of police, Port division.“We will try and ensure that the assembly is restricted on the main roads and not the ghats, where people will perform tarpan.”River traffic police teams will move up and down the Hooghly on speed boats, keeping an eye on people offering tarpan.Senior officers of the rank of assistant commissioner of police will oversee the arrangements at ghats while being in constant touch with the control room at the police headquarters in Lalbazar. Babughat will have the biggest deployment of forces among all 37 ghats, officers said. Guard rails and ropes have been sent to all ghats to restrict vehicles in the event of a surge in the number of visitors.By late Wednesday evening, several priests had reached Babughat and its adjoining areas, police said, with many deciding to spend the night on railway platforms at BBD Bag, Prinsep Ghat and other stations of Circular Railway.“We are not expecting the usual turnout because of the pandemic. So barring Strand Road, there is no specific traffic restriction,” a senior police officer said. “This time there won’t be trucks carrying idols to pandals. So, we have decided that restrictions will be imposed if there is a big gathering around a particular ghat. All traffic guards have been asked to inform the control room if there is a crowd surge.”Mahalaya marks the countdown to Durga Puja, which usually starts a week later. This year, however, the Puja begins on October 22.",2020-09-17 03:30:00
1412,Snehal Sengupta,Traffic jam solution: widen 500m of Jessore Road  - Telegraph India,"A 500-metre stretch of Jessore Road ahead of and after the Belghoria Expressway flyover will be widened to ease traffic flow in the airport area, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said on Wednesday.Also, a new gate will be built on Jessore Road, about 200m from the airport Gate No. 2.5, to minimise traffic snarls in the area, the officer said. The new gate will be wider than the 2.5 one so that more vehicles can pass through it, he said.The T-junction at Gate No. 2.5 gets choked the moment there is a heavy rush of vehicles, Sandipan Guha, a resident of Dum Dum who drives down the road regularly, said.Many people now enter the airport complex through the flyover instead of going through the chaos on the slip road. They take the road in front of Airport police station to reach Gate No. 2.5 from the opposite end and add to the congestion there, an officer said.Metro had on September 9 reported how vehicles crawl on Belghoria Expressway, Jessore Road and the airport’s slip road during rush hour because of a heavy traffic flow and innumerable potholes.Vehicles, including two-wheelers, headed to the city from Barasat, Dakshineswar, and Madhyamgram via Jessore Road or going to these places from the city are caught in traffic snarls that add more than 45 minutes to their travel time.The new gate will help in quicker dispersal of vehicles headed for the VIP Road from Belghoria Expressway as well as from Madhyamgram and Barasat. Once the gate is completed, motorists and two-wheeler riders can turn left and get on the airport road from the base of the flyover, an officer in the commissionerate said.Now, vehicles headed for the VIP Road from these places have to travel around 200m before they can turn left and get on the airport road from Gate No. 2.5.A joint inspection of the area was carried out by officials from the public works department, the Barasat highway division, and the Dum Dum Municipality, apart from representatives of the National Highway Authority of India and the Airports Authority of India.This was done to ensure better coordination among all agencies during the widening of the road, the police said.The new traffic plan is expected to ease snarls and “drastically cut” travel time, Dhritiman Sarkar, the deputy commissioner, traffic, of the Bidhannagar commissionerate, said. “We have conducted a detailed study… we are positive that this plan will work best for the region for now.”The airport’s outer compound wall will be broken to create the new gate that will give vehicles headed from the expressway access to the slip road without having to move till Gate No. 2.5, a PWD engineer who was part of the inspecting team said.Additionally, a 500m-long elevated storm water drain will be removed from near the approach to Gate No. 2.5. A new one will be created further back, the engineer said.A civic official from the Dum Dum Municipality said the proposal had been accepted and that a detailed survey would be carried out to shift the drain.",2020-09-17 03:38:00
1413,Debraj Mitra,Kolkata weather: Post-Sunday respite from heat on radar - Telegraph India,"Hot, humid and not as rainy as it should be, September has so far been uncomfortable for Calcuttans.There is no respite in sight till Sunday, by when the Met office expects a low-pressure to reach the Bay of Bengal and trigger steady rain in south Bengal, including Calcutta, over the next couple of days.The city is gradually taking strides towards normality in the backdrop of the pandemic and people stepping out for work are having to cope with sultry and sweaty conditions.The Celsius and moisture content have been on the higher side for several days now. Some parts of the city have seen occasional showers. But the rain has been scattered and triggered by local cloud formation. The showers were far too little to bring down the temperature. If anything, they made conditions more sweaty and increased the discomfort level.On Wednesday, the minimum relative humidity — the measure of the moisture content in the air during the driest part of the day — was a whopping 61 per cent. The effect — the temperature was around 33 degrees around 1.30pm but the RealFeel was 42 degrees.“A bus ride wearing a mask is almost unbearable. As soon as I got down, I bought a bottle of water, removed the mask and splashed the water on my face,” said Chandan Roy, a sales professional with a share trading firm who boarded a bus from Dunlop to Esplanade on Wednesday afternoon.Dark clouds started gathering over the city in the afternoon, prompting expectations of a round of sharp rain. But it was not to be.September is usually sultry but not without a spell or two of heavy rain. This year, there has been none so far. The city has received stray showers. The volume of rain so far in Calcutta has been around 100mm, compared with the usual half-way quota of 160mm, said a Met official.The monsoon trough is also stationed over Andhra Pradesh because of a low-pressure area in the southern state. The trough is too far from Calcutta to have an impact, said the official.The conditions are expected to change from Sunday, the Met office has said.“A cyclone currently positioned over the northwest Pacific is expected to reach northeast Bay of Bengal, via Vietnam, Thailand and Myanamar, around Sunday. But it is expected to lose strength and become a low-pressure system by the time it reaches the northeast Bay. From Monday, it is expected to move towards Gangetic Bengal,” said a Met official.The system is expected to trigger steady rain across south Bengal. A heavy spell in Calcutta is not ruled out. The system is also tipped to bring down the temperature from Sunday.",2020-09-17 04:29:00

BCom honours students under the choice based credit system (CBCS) will have theory exams from October 5 to 8.BBA Part III Honours students will have theory exams from October 1 to 9.Colleges will conduct the practicals for BSc students (except for those who have take the exams before the pandemic and their marks have already been uploaded) anytime between October 1 and 14.Colleges will conduct project work and viva voce exams for BCom Part III Honours students and those under the CBCS system anytime between October 1 and 14 with the help of internal examiners only for this year, the notice on the university website says.Since pen-and-paper tests cannot be conducted this year and students will take the exams from their homes, the university will email question papers to colleges. And colleges will email or WhatsApp the papers to students at the start of the exam.Students will have to email or WhatsApp their answer script in PDF format to their colleges within 24 hours of receiving the question paper, vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee had recently said.In case any student is unable to manage a smart device or unable to upload the answer script because of poor Net connectivity, he/she will have to submit a hardcopy of the answer script in a sealed envelope to his/her college within 24 hours, a university official said.“A large number of students live in remote areas. Many are from the Sunderbans where Net connectivity has been severely disrupted in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan,” Jaydeep Sarangi, the principal of New Alipore College, said.“The university should spell out clearly and share details with colleges so that no student is left out for want of Net connectivity.”Colleges have been requested to upload the question papers on their websites as well, a university official said.The schedule was prepared after the UGC last week approved the state government’s proposal that state universities be allowed to hold the final year exams from October 1

1415,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Covid: Akshar students’ call to connect over newsletter - Telegraph India,"Students of a city school have started an e-newsletter to talk about their times “as they remain stuck inside” homes because of the pandemic.The newsletter, Covid Chronicles, is an initiative of the students of Akshar school. They recently launched it over a webinar.Indira Biswas, a Class IX student, has penned her experience from the US where she went in February. She did not know that the “one-month holiday would turn into a six-month quarantine”.Indira, still stuck in New Jersey, lost her aunt during this period with whom she had been staying and the teenager has written how “the deadly virus had come” to them.Not only students but also a radiologist working in the city, Ambar Kumar Gupta, has written about doctors working during the pandemic. “... for once I am in my gear, the few patients who are coming to the hospital and need my examination keep me busy. In full gear I can hardly hear myself.” The school said the newsletter would give students an opportunity to channelise their energy and free time and do something positive while they remain at home.“Children are not happy with what is happening and channelising their creativity helps create positive vibes. It’s also a way to collaborate with other students despite not going to school,” Jayanti Neogi, a political science teacher at the school, said.Covid Chronicles is an initiative of the school’s literary and political science clubs.“We have extra time being stuck at home… it will give students a platform to express themselves. There is so much that students want to say and articulate during the pandemic,” Antara Dasgupta, a Class XII student, said.She is in the editorial team with classmate Rishita Chatterjee.The group has been hosting webinars, too. The latest was on Women in Power and how they want fundamental human rights.At the launch, the students invited former student Pranav Balakrishnan, a practising doctor working at a private hospital in the city as the Covid coordinator, along with radiologist Gupta.They asked them questions about the pandemic and the precautions one should take.If masks will be a companion forever, Balakrishnan said wearing a mask is a courtesy one is doing to others.“The most important thing is understanding.... It is a courtesy you are doing to people around you and you are hoping they will do the same courtesy to you,” he said. “You are preventing droplets; if you are infected it’s preventing them from getting released into the near surroundings and that’s why we probably should continue until we have a believable cure or a vaccine against this disease.”",2020-09-17 04:44:00
1416,Our Special Correspondent,National Medical College student found dead - Telegraph India,"A final-year MBBS student was found hanging inside his room in the main hostel of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday morning.Dibyendu Sardar, 24, appeared to have hanged himself from the ceiling fan using a bed sheet, an officer of Beniapukur police station investigating the matter said.The body has been sent for post-mortem. No suicide note has been found, the officer said.Some students from his batch have told cops that he had been keeping to himself of late. He apparently did not want to step out of his room on the top floor of the five-storey boys hostel on Beniapukur Road.Around 8am, some of his friends went to his room and found it locked from inside. After waiting for a while when repeated knocks went unanswered, some junior doctors alerted the police around 9am.“We entered the room and found him hanging,” an officer said. “Doctors said he had passed away a while ago.”A resident of Bairagipara in Gosaba in South 24-Parganas, the student had visited his parents recently following the death of a close relative.

These friends had tried to counsel him. They had told him that he would be a registered practitioner after clearing the final exams in a few months.After doctors at the hospital confirmed his death, cops alerted his father Jagadish Sardar and asked him to reach Calcutta.",2020-09-17 04:51:00
1417,Brinda Sarkar,Return of the app cycles - Telegraph India,"Love cycling but don’t have a bike? A cycle-sharing app, to be launched in New Town next week, will allow commuters to pick up a cycle from a spot, ride it around and return it when done. And the best part is that for the first half an hour, you can ride for free.Chartered Bike, an Ahmedabad-based company, will start operations in our smart city from September 24. Firhad Hakim, minister of urban development and municipal affairs, will come down for the ceremony. “New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has built five cycle stands for the service and shall build more later,” saidDebashis Sen, chairman cum managing director of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) and chairman of NKDA. How to hitch a rideTo avail of the cycles one needs to download the “Chartered Bike” on the phone. Activate your account with a minimum of Rs 300. This sum will be a prepaid deposit and charges will be deducted from here whenever you use a bike.The amount will have lifetime validity but in case a customer wishes, he can get his unused deposit refunded by writing an email to the company.Where to get the cycles The service is being launched with 100 cycles spread over five stations — New Town bus terminus, near Reliance Fresh, outside Axis Mall, Novotel and Dongfang Electric (near the Central Mall petrol pump).“Our largest station will be at Axis Mall. There will be space for 40 bikes here plus an additional 20 racks for riders who may have come from different stations on their cycles,” says Araz Khan, project manager of Chartered Bikes.The bikes will be “locked” at the stations but you can hire one with your app. Scan the QR code printed on the bike’s fender or frame lock and it will unlock. You can now take off.Should you halt somewhere mid-way you can get off the bike and click “parking” on the app. You will have to manually turn a lever on the wheel to lock it. Once you return, click “unpark” on the app and continue riding.When you want to return the bike  you have to do so at any of the five stations and click “end ride”. The meter on your phone will stop ticking and the corresponding payment will be deducted from the amount you have deposited in your account.First half hour free “Normally the first half an hour would cost Rs 5 but we are allowing it free as an introductory offer for the first six months,” says Khan.From the 31st to the 60th minute, the rider will be charged Rs 5 plus 18 per cent GST (Rs 5.9). From the 61st to 90th minute, it costs Rs 10 plus GST (Rs 11.8). Thereafter, every hour will be charged Rs 15 plus GST (Rs 17.7).“The final slab is the most expensive as we want to discourage people from keeping the bikes with themselves for too long. That means others are deprived from availing the cycles,” says Khan.E-cycles by year-end Besides 100 cycles now, the company will be introducing 400 e-cycles in the coming months.“An e-cycle runs on a battery that can be recharged like mobile phones,” explains Khan. “One doesn’t really need to learn riding an e-bike. One just starts pedalling and then stops as the vehicle moves automatically thereafter.”The e-bikes would move at a maximum of 25km per hour. Neither would the rider need a licence to ride this nor would the vehicle need a registration number plate.“The parking docks of these vehicles would double as charging stations and would start charging the moment a bike is returned by a rider. The fast chargers that would take an hour to charge completely. They would then travel 40km,” says Khan. Still, if a bike battery slows down mid-ride we have the pedal option. The rider can pedal the bike like a cycle to the nearest station and exchange his e-cycle for a fully charged one.”The rates for the e-cycles have not been finalised but are likely to be Rs 5 to unlock and then Rs 15 per hour. Penalty for vandalsThe bikes are insured and so in case of any damage in an accident the rider need not pay anything. “But we will levy penalty of Rs 5,000 if someone wilfully damages the bike or keeps the bike for more than 24 hours,” Khan says. “No one would need the bike for that long and so if someone does keep it, he may be trying to steal it.”The bikes have live GPS tracking  and so the backend office would always know where it is. Any attempt to steal the bike would be thwarted. “Our staff would go for daily rounds to work on the bikes’ maintenance. If they find any vehicles missing action would be taken,” says Khan.High hopes Sen is optimistic about the e-cycles. “People love to ride but get weary if the journey is too long. E-bikes can be the solution.”The authorities are working to increase cycle tracks in the township and talks are on to keep aside space for cycles at car parking lots too. There is 17km of cycle track now.Another cycle rental service called Pedl had launched in New Town in 2017 and despite immense popularity, was discontinued. “Their financial model was not sustainable and their docking system wasn’t fool-proof, leading to theft and misuse,” observed Sen.Chartered Bike is operational in Bhopal, Surat and Ranchi and Khan shares an anecdote from their Ranchi launch to show the faith he has in the residents of New Town. “A senior bureaucrat at the Ranchi launch had asked us to offer the cycles free of cost for the first week and we did so but it was a disaster,” he says.“People took the bikes home and used it like their personal vehicles, depriving others the chance to use them. And others, who got angry and jealous, vandalised the bikes. Compared to that, people of New Town are very civilised. All our surveys indicate that. I’m sure residents here will patronise the bike service,” says Khan.saltlake@abpmail.com",2020-09-18 00:13:00
1418,"Jayanta Basu, Subhajoy Roy",Plea for Chhath at Sarovar rejected - Telegraph India,"The National Green Tribunal on Thursday refused to hear the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority’s prayer to allow Chhath rituals on the Rabindra Sarobar premises and told the Bengal government’s lawyers they should feel happy that no cost had been imposed on them for filing such a petition.Tens of thousands of Calcuttans welcomed the order. One of them, Sumita Banerjee, told The Telegraph: “The CMDA is the protector of the place. Now imagine what sort of a protector is it that is asking for a relaxation that would destroy and devastate the place?”The tribunal’s eastern zonal bench of Justice S.P. Wangdi and expert member Nagin Nanda dismissed the review petition filed by the CMDA requesting modification of a 2017 order of the bench that had imposed a ban on Chhath Puja on the Sarobar premises.“We are dismissing the petition,” the bench said once the case came up for hearing. “You should feel happy that we are not imposing the cost.”But the state has not given up. An official said it was likely to move the Supreme Court against the tribunal’s order.Many thought the state’s position was dictated by the electoral necessity to not annoy Chhath worshippers ahead of the Assembly elections next year.There are many on the other camp, too, who value the biodiversity that the spraw-ling south Calcutta lake and the greens surrounding it represent.Author and singer Amit Chaudhuri, who has often fought an unequal battle with the city’s agencies to protect its heritage, told The Telegraph the CMDA’s petition was “in keeping with the tradition of government organs in Calcutta” not doing what they are meant to do. “This is not an aberration,” he said.Last year, thousands of Chhath revellers had broken padlocks on the gate and entered the lake premises, burst firecrackers, lit diyas on the water, played loud music and dirtied the place as police virtually allowed them a free run.The CMDA, in its submission, accepted its inability to comply with the tribunal’s order in 2019 stating that “the worshippers forcibly entered the Sarobar breaking the locks and Chhath Puja was forcefully performed in Rabindra Sarobar”.“We were helpless. The police did not help us (stop the revellers),” said a CMDA official.The ban was based on recommendations of an expert committee set up by the tribunal to assess the environmental status of the waterbody. Environment activist Subhas Datta, whose petition had originally prompted the tribunal to impose the ban on Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar, said after the dismissal of the petition: “We should not stop at this. We have all seen how the ban was flouted last year. We will have to ensure it is implemented this time.”The Telegraph had on September 8 reported that the CMDA, the custodian of Rabindra Sarobar, had filed a review petition at the tribunal seeking a “special permission” to allow Chhath Puja at the Sarobar.A CMDA official said their petition was a “suo motu” action. The official added that the agency filed the petition because the matter involved “the emotion of lakhs of people and the CMDA was not in a position to stop a mob” from entering the premises.The local Trinamul councillor, Baiswanar Chatterjee, echoed: “I am not ready to accept the version of environmentalists as gospel. One also has to acknowledge religious sentiments and the fact that the ritual is being practised for a long time.”Residents of the area disputed Chatterjee’s claim. They said the scale on which the defiling happens started around 2010.Datta said the administration had also failed to implement most of the recommendations proposed by the expert committee, even though they had been turned into a judicial order.Arunabha Majumder, an emeritus professor of Jadavpur University, said an event like Chhath at the lake contributes to water pollution in various ways. “First, the BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) increases with the increase of organic matter in water with so many people bathing, and fruits and flo-wers being dumped there. Secondly, oil and grease poured into the water as part of puja offerings reduce oxygen transfer in the water, which may affect the lives of aquatic animals.”State urban development minister and CMDA chairperson Firhad Hakim had earlier promised to clear the pollution within a day, which has been countered by the green crusaders. “Cleaning the banks and reducing the pollution are not the same, as the latter has a far reaching impact on the environment,” an activist said.The CMDA should not have filed the review petition. Rabindra Sarobar is like the lungs of south Calcutta. It holds such an important place in terms of the city’s environment. If a precedent is set by allowing Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar, then many more things would have been done using this precedent.Abin Chaudhuri, architect and Lake morning walkerThere is a tradition of bodies that are meant to protect not doing their job in Calcutta. This is not an aberration, but it should be countered and opposed. People should continue to oppose as long as bodies and government organs that have been entrusted with a certain duty do not do that. As long as they do not realise that it is their job to be responsible for something, we should continue to oppose it.Amit Chaudhuri, author, singer and founder of Calcutta Architectural Legacies (CAL)The CMDA is the protector of the place. Now imagine what sort of a protector is it that is asking for a relaxation that would destroy and devastate the place. The NGT has said that Chhath Puja cannot be organised inside the Sarobar. It is the government’s duty to see that people go to other places. The government is meant to make people obey a court’s order.Sumita Banerjee, a regular at Rabindra Sarobar and an activist fighting for its protection",2020-09-18 01:40:00
1588,Subhankar Chowdhury,UGC sets October date for results - Telegraph India,"The UGC has asked the state government to publish the results of end semester/final year exams “preferably” by the end of October so that admissions to the first year of postgraduate/PhD programme “can be completed without any further delay and the next session can commence timely”.UGC’s secretary Rajnish Jain in a letter to the state higher education department on Wednesday set the timeline while accepting the department’s request to extend the deadline for completing the exams till October 18.The previous deadline was September 30.“Accordingly, the final year/terminal semester examinations in colleges and universities be completed by October 18. Further, you are also requested to ensure that the results of these examinations be declared at the earliest and preferably by the end of October so that the admissions…” says the letter addressed to higher education secretary Manish Jain on September 16.Jain had on September 2 sought the permission in a letter to the UGC’s chairman as the Supreme Court had said on August 28 that if any state or Union territory decided that it was not possible to hold the undergraduate and postgraduate exams by September 30, in keeping with the UGC’s July 6 advisory, it could seek an extension of the deadline.An official of the Bengal higher education department said the vice-chancellors of all state-aided universities had been informed about the communication from the UGC.“The publication of results by the end of October can pose a challenge for the affiliating universities like Calcutta University, which has over 140 colleges affiliated to it. But the deadline has to be honoured,” said the official. CU uploaded its exam schedule on Wednesday on its website, www.caluniv.ac.in.Getting the answer scripts from such a large number of students, many of whom lack the facilities to email or WhatsApp their scripts in the PDF format to their colleges within 24 hours of receiving the question papers, could pose a problem, the official said.“CU has to come up with a guideline on how the scripts could be obtained from all students. I believe teachers will have to evaluate the scripts through the Puja vacation to comply with the deadline,” the official said.Repeated calls to CU vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee went unanswered.“We will try to publish results before the Puja vacation starts,” said an official of Jadavpur University, which will hold exams from October 1 to 10.",2020-09-18 01:49:00
1759,Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus in West Bengal: Church goes online for Easter service - Telegraph India,"Neither Good Friday today nor Easter on Sunday can be observed at churches due to the lockdown but there has never been a more desperate time to pray. So churches are turning to technology to make sure scared and worried devotees can still reach them for guidance.“For the last few weeks we have been following the bishop’s service on Facebook and YouTube,” said Sudipendra Mondal, a member of the largest church in Kestopur Christian para, Emmanuel Church. He is also closely involved with running of the institution. “The church is shut to public with only the priest and his family living on the premises now.”At present, the faithful are observing 40 Days of Lent. “This is a period of mourning and we usually have service on Wednesday and Friday evenings with 300 to 400 members coming over. We have a colourful Easter procession too but all that has been called off now,” adds Mondal. But they are trying to keep members involved by installing loudspeakers on the festive day. “That way we can be united in listening to the sermons of the bishop and our priest.”Mondal’s own father is hospitalised and he has been using video calls from fellow members and priests to boost his spirit.Pastor Jennith Israel of City Living Assembly has erected a make-shift studio at his apartment in DLF New Town Heights so they can telecast videos during the lockdown. “Not just festive service, we are streaming videos daily to keep members grounded amidst all the news of death and disease. We share positive thoughts, prayers for the sick and music,” he says.Just before the lockdown, Israel’s in-laws moved in with them and his sister-in-law is a drummer. His own wife is a keyboardist, his neighbour is a bass guitarist and the neighbour’s wife a singer. “So together we are able to present a band,” smiles the pastor. Their children are putting up dances.The church usually holds their meetings at CK Block’s IPHE Hall and next to Shapoorji Pallonji complex in New Town. But online, they are getting views from even Dubai and Ethiopia.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) has a centre in CE Block but they have asked members to stay home, focus on teachings of the Christ and to observe a fast on Good Friday so the pandemic may be controlled, caregivers protected, economy strengthened and life normalised.“I will try to watch YouTube and make Easter eggs for my daughter,” smiles Anita Pyne, a member who lives in AD Block. “If they don’t turn out well I’ll promise her chocolates after the lockdown. But what’s important is to focus on the resurrection of the Christ as it gives us hope of being resurrected too.”The church’s website has shared books, videos etc. for all to study.Pastor Purnendu Sinha, who usually conducts gatherings for Immanuel Fellowship Gathering church at CK Block’s IPHE hall, plans to post videos of the crucification on their WhatsApp group and then stream the Seven Sayings of Jesus on the cross. “But just because they’re home members cannot take it lightly. When they kneel to pray they have to be serious about it,” he says.Sinha will also explain Psalm 91 verse 3, which mentions that if you surrender to god he will save you from epidemics. “Covid-19 is perhaps God’s judgement on mankind, that had become immoral and materialistic. Together we need to seek His forgiveness,” he says.Incidentally Sinha got married earlier this year but his wife, who is a Filipino assistant pastor, has not been able to come to India due to the lockdown.Devotees say they will miss the celebrations this year. “I always look forward to Easter. The decorations with palm leaves, the music, messages and food are all lovely,” says Suparna Mukherjee, a member of Immanuel Fellowship Gathering. “Nonetheless I shall feel pious even without going to church. The weather becomes cheerful and sunny every Easter and I shall say my prayers solemnly.”",2020-10-04 05:47:00
1760,Jayanta Basu,Coronavirus in West Bengal: Risk in waste of quarantined  - Telegraph India,"The medical waste generated by contacts of Covid-19 positive persons quarantined at their homes can spread the infection unless collected and treated properly, warn public health experts.Though the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation area has about 500 such home isolation cases, till Wednesday evening such waste collection had not been initiated in the township as in other urban local bodies in  the state despite the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) specific directive in this regard. “We are not aware of any such directive; but as you are saying we will soon look into the directive,” mayor Krishna Chakraborty told The Telegraph. Subsequently Pranay Roy, mayor-in-council in charge of health, confirmed that they would take appropriate action soon.On Wednesday evening, the state pollution control board’s member secretary Rajesh Kumar issued a letter to the state urban development secretary and the state rural development secretary sharing the CPCB directive, requesting local authorities to act.CPCB had earlier issued two guidelines in March to municipalities with instructions. “In case of home-care for suspected patients, biomedical waste should be collected separately in yellow bags and the same shall be handed over to authorised waste collectors engaged by local bodies,” read the first guideline which further stated that “ULB (urban local body) should engage CBWTF (common biomedical waste treatment facility) to pick up such waste either directly from quarantined houses or from identified collection points”.The revised guideline issued by CPCB member secretary Prashant Gargava says municipalities should “create a separate team of workers who shall be engaged in door step waste collection” after imparting special training and providing dedicated vehicles.Experts observe that even if a small fraction of those in home quarantine test positive, inappropriate waste management can prove disastrous. “There can be biomedical waste from used masks, tissue paper, used cotton, medicine left overs or any other materials disposed by the quarantined persons. Unless this is collected separately and incinerated, there remains high risk of the infection spreading,” said Utpal Chattapadhyay, director of All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health (AIIH&PH) to The Telegraph.Naba Dutta, secretary of green platform Sabuj Mancha, said that proper training should be imparted to both the quarantined families and the waste collectors.",2020-10-04 05:47:00
1761,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus in West Bengal: New Town residents’ gift of blood - Telegraph India,"At a time when the supply lines are running dry with potential donors stuck indoors due to the nationwide lockdown, residents of New Town came together to help in the treatment of a seven-year-old afflicted with cancer.On March 31, the young leukaemia patient needed a bone marrow transplant at Tata Memorial Hospital for which he needed 18 units of blood which neither the hospital nor the family could arrange. Arunangshu Chakraborty, consultant, anaesthesia and critical care, at the hospital was off duty that day but sent out an SOS message in a local residents’ WhatsApp group as well as his own complex (Elita Garden Vista).“At our hospital, we do not accept blood from elsewhere as we are never confident about the quality. We undertake intense testing before accepting blood in our own bank which is not the case elsewhere. Our patients need blood in large volumes during operations as also for transfusions. They are encouraged to bring donors with them. But in this case it was impossible for the family to arrange,” he explained.Within hours, nine people responded, driving down to the hospital on their own. The others were asked to come the day after.Tapas Adhikary of CD Block was one of them. “I got the message in our WhatsApp group of blood donors and immediately drove off to the hospital. A couple of people, I heard, had already donated and left. A gathering was not advisable in such a scenario,” he said.Gautam Bhadra of Greenwood Sonata, another donor, was impressed to see a mother of nine-month-old twins waiting to give blood to the seven-year-old. “None of us knew the child or met his parents but it was great that we could still come forward and do the needful for a humanitarian cause,” Bhadra said.The child is still in hospital under treatment, sources said.",2020-10-04 05:47:00
1762,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Calcutta misses Easter goodies - Telegraph India,"Fedora Kolentine, 9, has missed the annual ritual of visiting New Market this year to buy Easter eggs and hampers for her friends and cousins.New Market is closed. The few confectioneries that are running are mostly making breads. Some have refused Easter orders and across homes celebrations are muted because of the lockdown.Confectionaries are short-staffed and have to deal with unavailability of ingredients. Also, demand is low because stepping out of homes is not an option.Flurys has ramped up its production of breads but only hot cross buns and chocolate bunnies. Usually, every year there is the traditional simnel cake, carrot cake and the marzipan or chocolate eggs.Last year, there was an elaborate Easter brunch. “This year, we do not have an extensive Easter menu as most of our stores are shut for the lockdown… and our focus is on producing and supplying breads — an essential commodity,” Vikas Kumar, executive chef, Flurys, said. “Since movement of people is extremely limited, we do not have a huge demand.”Fedora is compensating for the missed chance of going to a confectioner by helping her mother with a few things at home. “Some of the outlets are open but I cannot risk taking her out; so, we are preparing some Easter eggs at home,” her mother Dorothy Kolentine, 42, who works in the administrative section of a city school said. “It’s a tradition to go out on Saturday to get stuff… visit relatives on Sunday, all of which has to be changed this year.”Kookie Jar, which opened two of its outlets this week only for breads, has had to refuse Easter orders. “People have been calling us to place Easter orders but we have had to refuse them. We do not have the manpower… and also ingredients are not available,” Lovey Barman, director of Kookie Jar, said.Rahul Sequeira has bought some Easter eggs for his family from a confectioner but the teacher said he missed giving hampers to kids in the neighbourhood. “It is the time when many of us do that but it won’t be possible this year.”",2020-10-04 20:22:00
1763,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Xavier’s gives free ration to poor on Good Friday - Telegraph India,"Three hundred families, staring at hunger because of Covid-19, got a week’s free ration at a distribution camp at St Xavier’s College on Good Friday.Each family got three kilos of rice, two kilos each of wheat and potato, a litre of oil and 500gm pulses.“This sharing of meal signifies caring for our neighbours, who are in distress in this trying time, as it has always been the principle of Xaverians to be ‘men and women for others’,” said Father Dominic Savio, the principal of St Xavier’s College (autonomous) and among those who distributed the ration.The Good Friday Prayer Service was conducted only by the priests who prayed for the well-being of people in these testing times. The regular attendees prayed from their homes.The beneficiaries — cobblers, plumbers, rickshaw-pullers among them — came from Mullickbazar, Park Lane and Park Circus. “Police helped us identify those in distress and reach out to them. The night school for underprivileged children run by the institution, too, led us to many families,” said Firdausul Hasan of the St Xavier’s College Calcutta Alumni Association, which had organised Friday morning’s camp.The volunteers of the association had earmarked spots for each family representative. The priests who distributed the ration wore gloves and masks, as did those who queued up.The volunteers of the association had visited the homes of distressed families to hand them tokens and asked one person from each family to reach the Park Street campus around 9am.The distribution continued for close to 90 minutes.About 400 million people working in the informal economy in India are at risk of falling deeper into poverty because of the novel coronavirus crisis, the International Labour Organization has said in its report.A majority of migrant labourers working in Calcutta have gone back to the districts or neighbouring states like Bihar and Jharkhand.The city’s resident population of daily wage earners are flocking distribution camps. But there are still many hungry people.Earlier in March, the students, teachers, non-teaching staff, alumni and fathers of St Xavier’s College and St Xavier’s School contributed Rs 40 lakh to the chief minister’s relief fund to fight the novel coronavirus outbreak.",2020-10-04 20:27:00

There were 23 bottles of country liquor and 22 bottles of beer in the car, the police said.There has been a demand for liquor across the state ever since the Centre announced a 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.During this period, sale or transport of anything that is non-essential is prohibited, the police said. “Based on specific information, we intercepted the car and arrested Bijay Sardar, 30, a resident of the Basanti area, and Subodh Haldar, 40, of Naskarhat in Anandapur,” an officer in the east division said.Apart from the bottles and the vehicle, the mobile phones found on Sardar and Haldar have been seized.The two have been booked for violating the lockdown and under the West Bengal excise act.Earlier this week, the excise department's Calcutta (south) wing had seized 200 bottles of foreign liquor from inside a spa in the Ballygunge area.",2020-10-04 20:52:00

1766,Shrenik Avlani,Coronavirus cuts short world tour  - Telegraph India,"Many scenarios had played out in my mind about how I’d return home from my yearlong around-the-world journey that started last July. I’d have turned 40, a newcomer into mid-life, by the time I got back with Vision 2020 transformed into Mission 2020 in a changed world raring to take on the new decade. Of course, all this after a week of sharing stories, as well as fresh duty- free haul, and libations with friends and family. Instead, I returned home on March 22, 2020, to what resembled a scene from an end-of-the-world zombie movie — a scenario I hadn’t imagined even in my wildest dreams. Suspicious policemen and medics in hazmat suits kept an eagle eye on me, and every other passenger, in an eerily empty Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport, where I was returning after 242 days of feeding my wanderlust across four continents — my voyage cut short by a global pandemic.Last July when I boarded an Air India Dreamliner to Madrid with a one-way ticket and valid Schengen, Canada and US visa-powered passport, there was no plan, no itinerary; only a strong wanderlust and a fluid idea: to see the world for a year, understand its people and their way of life, sample culture and spirits, meet old friends, make new ones and hammer into my laptop the book that had been writing itself in my head for two years now. When I set foot in Madrid, my immediate crisis was how long ought I stay there and where next? A fairly critical issue at that point because after having left behind the drudgery of full-time work in April 2012, I have barely stayed in one place for more than a month at a stretch. As I met cousins and bumped into friends who were also traveling, my trip sort of plotted its own course from Madrid to Cordoba and Seville in southern Spain and then across the border to the Algarve coast of Portugal and up along the western coastline to Lisbon, Porto, Guimares and Braga, crossing over into northern Spain. I stumbled into Bilbao in the Basque country while the entire city was celebrating the weeklong Aste Nagusia festival, participated in all revelry while also taking in bits of a hungover city. Those were times when matters like where to catch the sunset, where to eat and frowning upon the plummeting levels of fitness after cheerfully wasted days were what made us pause. I drank wine watching the sun set behind the Eiffel Tower from a rooftop with Parisian and Indian friends sharing stories and wine, rested in Bremen, got inked in Vilnius, kayaked in Copenhagen, had nights with fuzzy memories in the dive bars of New York, tried writing in New Orleans, got restless and made my way to Chile where I and my wanderlust became victims of the anti-government protests, hiked five days to see Machu Picchu, took a road trip to Mexico’s Baja California, camped on the beach with surfers to ring in 2020, climbed the Aztec and Mayan temples in Mexico and Guatemala, sipped rum and fought mosquitoes in Belize, watched Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway in February and welcomed March in Seattle with the new cherry blossoms. There were rough moments too. I was denied entry into Ecuador because visa rules had changed for Indians in August 2019, was robbed by cops in Tulum (Mexico), lost everything I owned when my backpack was stolen from the airport, and had my brand-new iPhone 11 snatched by a skilful thief on a bike in Bali. None of that affected my wanderlust and after every setback I bounced back even more determined to keep going. On March 11, WHO declared coronavirus a pandemic. Coronavirus became everyone’s reality. So much has come to pass since that day that most of the previous eight months of travel feel like events from another lifetime. All that I remember are the last two weeks when the world, as we had known it, first started changing. I was in San Francisco that day and there already were signs of the US’s impending crisis. Most companies had asked their employees, except the very critical ones, to work from home. Schools had started declaring holidays and universities had moved classes online. Business travellers, scared of getting stuck, had started cutting their trips short. My own Korean Air flight to Vietnam was cancelled. My Indian passport left me very few options. The only viable option was Indonesia because I still wanted to travel. I found a Singapore Airlines connection to Bali for March 14. It was a deserted airport that morning and while I was checking in at San Francisco, President Trump had declared an emergency. When I connected to the free airport WiFi, messages from friends started popping up. They all had one message: “you are getting out at a good time”. I reached Bali on March 16 via Singapore. I had to hand over a health form and get my temperature checked before the immigration officer let me through. On my way to the hostel in Canggu, I was slowed down by the never-ending Bali rush hour. There were backpackers and tourists on scooties shuttling between the rice fields of Ubud and beaches of Seminyak, Kuta and Canggu. That end-of-the-world feeling that seemed to have gripped the world had not spread here. Not yet.The next morning when people gathered around the pool for breakfast, the Germans were talking about travel restrictions while the English were talking about rumours of a lockdown in Indonesia. By lunchtime, the only conversation was how quickly the virus was spreading and how to get back home. This was no longer an adventure or fun. Before stepping out for lunch I booked a flight to Calcutta for March 21 on a Thai Airways flight via Bangkok. Nervousness took over completely. When an English lad in the dorm coughed, I slept with my mask on and moved to a private room in a hotel far away the next morning. At restaurants everyone wanted to keep safe distance. No one wanted to contract anything that could potentially stop them from flying. On March 21, eager to get back to India, which had banned all international flights for a week starting the next day, I reached the airport three-and-a-half hours early. But the check-in queue was so long that it took two hours to drop my bags and get a boarding pass. Instead of frustration, I was surprised to find myself smiling. Most people on board were getting a connection in Bangkok to go home as news of more and more nations going into a lockdown came in.During my home quarantine in my 120 sq ft room, I was staying sane by keeping tab on all my friends who were still trying to get back home. Since I had a lot of time, I tried imagining what life and travel in a post-pandemic world would be like. There was not one image where either life or travel looked as familiar as they used to four weeks ago.",2020-10-04 21:05:00
1767,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Coronavirus Pandemic no bar for stealing jeans  - Telegraph India,"A garments store inside New Market that has been under lock and key since the lockdown in Calcutta started on March 23 was broken into and around 30 pairs of jeans were stolen.Police said Laltu Mallick, 21, and Kabir Mallick, 19, were arrested in connection with the burglary on Thursday and 26 pairs of the stolen jeans were recovered from them.A guard had spotted the wooden door of the garments shop, Taj Collections, broken on Wednesday and raised an alarm.“It was apparent that someone had broken into the shop and cleared out two racks stacked with jeans. Nothing seems to have been touched in the rest of the store. This suggests the burglars were in a hurry,” said an officer of New Market police station.The shop number is Miscellaneous II A/201. It is located in the “Miscellaneous” building, close to the area where essential supplies are sold.“We started a case on Wednesday but could not find any lead from the CCTV camera footage,” an officer said.The cops zeroed in on six suspects based on the crime pattern in the area. “One of them confessed to the burglary,” the officer said.Laltu Mallick, 21, a resident of Korabardhan Lane, was arrested and 10 pairs of stolen jeans were allegedly recovered from him.On pursuing his statement, the police arrested Kabir Mallick, 19, from the same neighbourhood. Sixteen pairs of jeans are said to have been recovered from him.More than 3,000 establishments in the shopping hub are closed because of the lockdown forced by the coronavirus. Only the ones selling grocery, eggs, meat and milk are open.“The New Market shopping hub, maintained by the market department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, has 30 gates. Only a few, which lead to the essential supply stores, remain open,” said Ashraf Ali, assistant joint secretary, SS Hogg Market Traders Association.“Adequate security has been arranged for the shops. A guard usually takes 10 to 15 minutes to make a complete round of the building. Which means a guard appears in front of a shop every 10 to 15 minutes,” he said.",2020-10-04 21:14:00
1768,Mita Mukherjee,"Coronavirus lockdown: Don’t raise fees, Bengal govt to schools - Telegraph India","The Bengal government on Friday wrote to private schools asking them not to increase their fees this year and consider “sympathetically” if guardians were unable to pay fees on time.“…Under the circumstances, it is therefore advised to all concerned once again, to have a considerate view of the matter and restrain from enhancing school fees during the current academic year. Any case of delayed payment/non-payment of the fee by the guardian in the prevailing situation may be considered sympathetically,” the government’s letter to the heads of all private schools said.Officials said the government had taken “a serious view” of allegations that private schools were yet to respond to an appeal on the issue from education minister Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday.“The Hon’ble Minister in charge of Education Department, Government of West Bengal has already made an appeal to the authorities of all schools not to increase the fees considering the current situation and to consider the matter of non-payment of fee by the guardian, if any, sympathetically. However, it has been reported that a few schools have not yet given a positive response so far. The matter has been seriously viewed by the State Government,” read the letter, signed by principal secretary Manish Jain.The letter said it was unfortunate that private and unaided schools affiliated to various boards had not only increased the fees but were also “pressing” guardians to deposit the fees while the lockdown was on.The letter reminded the schools about the measures being taken by the state government to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and how the government was trying to help people by waiving various fees and taxes.The guardians had been complaining about financial constraints because of the lockdown.Most schools have introduced the enhanced fees this month. Many have announced a higher-than-usual hike from April to raise funds for implementing the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission for teachers and other non-teaching employees of the institutes.ICSE classes The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations will conduct virtual classes for IX to XII, which will be aired on ABP Ananda on April 11 and 12 between noon and 1pm. The council on Monday wrote to the school heads to encourage students to watch the programmes. The initiative has been taken to reach out to more students.The council will consider increasing the number of virtual classes on the channel if the first set of programmes generate sufficient interest among the students and teachers, the council letter to the schools said.",2020-10-04 21:22:00
1769,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Private hospitals of Calcutta pass up Covid-19 cases - Telegraph India,"Several private hospitals in Calcutta are referring patients with Covid-19 symptoms or those who have tested positive for the virus to designated hospitals for coronavirus cases instead of treating them, officials of the hospitals and the state health department said.A notification issued by the state health department on April 3 states “individuals seeking treatment in private hospitals are free to do so”.“There is no government directive on shifting Covid-19 patients from private hospitals to government hospitals designated for such patients. Private hospitals can treat patients who have Covid-19 symptoms or tested positive for the disease, scrupulously abiding by the protocol,” a state government official said on Friday.The “referrals” from private hospitals are because of several reasons, including concerns about the highly contagious virus infecting other patients, and doctors, nurses and paramedics. Besides, sources said, news about several hospitals in Mumbai having been sealed following spread of the virus within the facilities are playing on the minds of the managements of private hospitals in the city.Officials of several hospitals also cited “confusing verbal communications” from health department officials about where Covid-19 patients should be treated.Officials of at least three private hospitals said health department officials had verbally told them to refer coronavirus patients to designated government-run hospitals. One of the officials said on Friday that they had received another verbal directive, which asked the hospital to treat coronavirus patients.The state government has designated Infectious Diseases and Beleghata General Hospital, MR Bangur Hospital, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (New Town) and AMRI Hospitals Salt Lake (annexe) for Covid-19 treatment in Calcutta.“We are identifying patients in our emergency isolation unit who have coronavirus symptoms such as fever, cough and respiratory distress. We are asking them to go to MR Bangur or ID Hospital in Beleghata,” the CEO of a private hospital said.“The isolation rooms in our hospital were set up for SARS and swine flu patients. Covid-19 is far more contagious. We fear other patients in the hospital could catch the virus if coronavirus cases are kept in the isolation unit. So, we are not taking any risk,” he said.Most private hospitals have their isolation units in the building where other patients are treated. Many have designated a floor for isolation, while some have negative pressurised rooms (the air pressure inside is lower than that outside) for the facility.“But we have to take the coronavirus suspects up on common elevators, which then need to be sanitised. Also, the emergency area is not completely isolated,” an official of another private hospital said.Some are worried about a rerun of the Wockhardt or Yashlok hospital incident. The two Mumbai hospitals had to be sealed off because of coronavirus contamination.Health department sources said several coronavirus treatment centres such as MR Bangur and AMRI Salt Lake are not yet fully ready.Recently, the brother of a patient admitted at MR Bangur had written to chief minister Mamata Banerjee highlighting the lack of basic facilities there.",2020-10-04 21:50:00
1770,Sanjay Mandal,Consultant doctors in Kolkata switch off in fear of coronavirus spread  - Telegraph India,"Functioning has been hit in most private hospitals because a large number of doctors are reluctant to see patients for fear of catching the novel coronavirus, hospital and health department officials said.The CEO of a private hospital said that patients and staff often found consultants’ phones switched off. Sometimes the phone rang but the doctor would not take the call.State health department officials had at a meeting with private hospital representatives last week asked them to resume normal functioning in all their units, including outpatient departments and clinics.But officials from several private hospitals pleaded helplessness, saying many doctors were unwilling to report for work.“I have received reports from many private hospitals that some doctors are refusing to attend to patients. I appeal to these doctors to be more humane. If you turn away from the crisis, it will finally get you too,” retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, the regulatory body for private hospitals, said on Sunday.“I have received a complaint that says a private hospital asked a patient’s relatives to arrange for a specialist doctor if the patient were to be admitted. The specialist doctor attached to that hospital would apparently not see patients.”Banerjee referred to another complaint that said a doctor had for two days refused to see a patient admitted to a private hospital. The hospital then asked the patient’s relatives to shift the patient elsewhere.A south Calcutta resident who had sought an appointment with his long-time dentist for an urgent intervention was allegedly told the dentist would not be visiting his clinic before August.Hospitals can ask doctors whom they employ against salaries to report for work, but they cannot force doctors who practise as consultants to see patients, health department officials said.“In Calcutta, large segments of doctors are consultants; they are mostly paid a fixed amount plus a percentage of the charges for consultancy and procedures,” a health official said.According to the hospitals, most of those reluctant to see patients are the elderly doctors, and those whose specialities potentially expose them to the patients’ droplet secretions.“Doctors from the fields of pulmonology, ENT, ophthalmology, dentistry and gastroenterology face the highest threat of catching the infection (from their patients). Many doctors from these fields are unwilling to see patients now,” an official from a private hospital said.Some doctors, like 67-year-old ophthalmologist Abhijit Sen, are exceptions.“It’s true that an ophthalmologist has to come extremely close to the patient during an examination. But I wear a facemask, a face shield and gloves. Besides, I wash my hands and face after each procedure. We can’t stop seeing patients,” Sen said.The Telegraph had last week reported how a 28-year-old doctor from Calcutta had got infected by the coronavirus at New York’s Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, where he is a postgraduate trainee, but resumed treating Covid-19 patients within two days of recovery.Dr Abhishek Chakraborti had said that at his hospital, doctors from every speciality were undergoing training on the Covid-19 treatment protocol so they could fill in for infected colleagues if necessary.",2020-10-05 21:27:00
1771,Our Special Correspondent,Case against Babul over ‘fake’ message - Telegraph India,"A message on social media with a photograph that purportedly shows two men — one resembling state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha and the other, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s brother Kartick Banerjee — sharing drinks is fake, police have said.The police have started a case against Union minister Babul Supriyo for sharing the message on his Twitter handle @SuPriyoBabul.On Sunday, the official Twitter handle of the deputy commissioner, south, declared the message as “fake”.“We have prima facie evidence to suggest that the information shared in the message is fake. We have drawn up a case against Babul Supriyo and others,” an officer said.Babul Supriyo, the Union minister of state for environment, forest and climate, had apparently tweeted a photograph on May 9 and written: “Can you identify the ‘characters’ in this super-viral picture?”Sometime later, he retweeted the photograph. “Its Honble WBCM @MamataOfficial's brother Kartick Banerjee with the Current Chief Secretary of Bengal Rajiva Sinha! The drinks r fine but this viral photo does raise many questions given who they are!! THIS sure IS NOT A NORMAL PIX,” the minister had written in his second tweet.A case had been started at Kalighat police station based on a complaint lodged by a Trinamul Congress supporter, the police said.The police, however, did not clarify which part of the message on social media — the photograph or the information revealing the identity of the men in the photograph or the fact that the photograph was viral on social media — was fake.A few hours after the police declared the message as fake, the minister said in a tweet, while replying to another tweet that said he was a responsible central government minister and should not share fake messages, “I am not here to do dirty politics but at least three credible journo shared the pic with me that had already gone viral & I had just asked the question IF what we see is true. And u see the unholy nexus of Didi’s Police @aitc Neta’s R well-documented.”Metro could not contact the minister. Late in the evening, his aide asked Metro to send a message and said that the minister would revert. There was no reply till late at night.Consuming alcohol is not illegal in India. Among the businesses the Centre has permitted to open despite the lockdown are liquor stores.A case has been started against the minister and others under various IPC sections (promoting enmity between various groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language; doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony and making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report with the intent to cause or likely to cause fear or alarm to public or any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against the public tranquility).The police will question 'all parties concerned' before divulging details. The minister could be summoned for interrogation, the police said.Investigating officers have contacted Facebook and Twitter to find out who had posted the photograph first. The photograph will be sent for forensic examination to determine its authenticity, the police said.",2020-10-05 21:29:00
1773,Kinsuk Basu,"Tropical doctor tests positive for Covid-19, CCU shut - Telegraph India","The School of Tropical Medicine on Sunday shut its critical care unit (CCU) after a doctor and two others tested positive for Covid-19.Patients from the unit have been shifted to the adjoining Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. The Covid-19 tests will continue at the hospital, though, a School of Tropical Medicine official said.“We will open the CCU once necessary preventive steps have been taken. All efforts are being taken in consultation with the health department to ensure that testing facilities and the OPD function normally,” the official said.The institution tests more than 200 samples daily.This is the first time that a doctor of the School of Tropical Medicine has tested positive, a health department official said.“He has been admitted to the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, along with two others who have tested positive,” the official said.The Calcutta Medical College and Hospital is now a dedicated Covid-19 hospital.The infected doctor had complained of fever and breathlessness a few days ago. His swab sample was put to test immediately and he had been quarantined.A list of his contacts has been drawn up, according to doctors. Two others, including a patient admitted to the institution and a healthcare worker, have tested positive. Their contact lists are being readied, another health department official said.Earlier, five healthcare workers of the institution had tested positive for the coronavirus and 30 employees, including a doctor, had been quarantined.Health department officials said plans were afloat to find additional hands from other institutions so that the shortage of staff at the School of Tropical Medicine could be managed and the functioning of most facilities, including the fever clinic, did not take a hit.The health department has sought a list of doctors and healthcare workers from the adjoining medical college.",2020-10-05 21:35:00
1775,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus lockdown: NUJS students raise funds for support staff - Telegraph India,"A group of students of the National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) raised funds to provide Rs 5,000 to each of the 80 members of the institution's support staff.The students arranged the one-time monetary help to ease the employees’ inconvenience during the lockdown to an extent, Prakhar Srivastava, one of the students, said.Around Rs 70,000 has been kept aside for treatment if any of the employees get infected with the coronavirus. Some of the employees are permanent while some are casual workers too. And their monthly salaries vary between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000. Many have a family of five to six to look after.“They (employees) had to spend on protecting themselves from being infected with the coronavirus. They had to buy hand sanitisers and proper masks. Some found it difficult to buy these items,” Srivastava said.The students started a drive on April 12 to raise funds. “Many of these employees help us in various ways. They are like a family to us,” another student said. “So, present students, teachers and the alumni came forward to donate generously when we told them about our initiative. We requested them to donate whatever they could.”By April 20, a corpus of Rs 4.54 lakh had been created. “A decision was taken to distribute Rs 5,000 to each of the 80 support staff,” the student said.Students managing the drive contacted each of the employees and collected their bank details. The money was transferred to their accounts in phases.“More than 75 of them have already received the money. A small number of employees are still to receive because of some technical problems,” Srivastava said.Donations kept coming even after April 20. “So, we decided to keep Rs 70,000 aside for their treatment,” Srivastava said.The university is shut so the donors sent the money to Srivastava's account, from where Rs 5,000 was transferred to each of the employees.In order to maintain transparency, the details of the transaction will be audited by the university's finance committee when the institute reopens after the lockdown.If the money kept aside for the employees' treatment remains unused, it would be transferred to the university employees' welfare fund.",2020-10-05 21:45:00
1776,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Teacher’s turn to help the needy during lockdown - Telegraph India,"A farmer’s son who could complete his education and go on to become a primary school teacher in East Midnapore with help from others is now going door to door, distributing ration to the poor and the hungry. Sanatan Jana, 31, who is on the verge of completing PhD in applied mathematics from Jadavpur University, has been collecting funds with the help of friends, acquaintances and organisations and reaching out to people in villages around Contai, Ramnagar and Digha in East Midnapore.The teacher of Petua Junior High School has so far helped 135 families and will reach out to 50 more this week. He tries to focus on families who are receiving little or no help. Among those who Jana has distributed ration to are 15-odd families in Digha who had come from Jharkhand for the construction of a road and got stuck because of the lockdown. Jana and fellow teacher Teheran Hossain tour the villages on their bikes, taking essentials to the needy.“They do not have any income and with no money or food, domestic fights are on the rise. Many among these families had been going without food for days,” said Jana. Even before the lockdown, Jana had started Fairfield Excellence, an organisation that provides monthly scholarships to students whose families cannot afford their education. “Wherever I am today,  it is largely because of the help I have received at different stages of my life to continue my education. Our father was a farmer and the Rs 2,000 that he would earn was barely enough to meet our daily and monthly expenses with three schoolgoing children. It was not possible for us to pay Rs 5,000 or 6,000 for college admission,” Jana recalled.From his school teachers to family friends, Jana had been helped by many. He is also indebted to Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, where he did graduation in mathematics, and Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur, where he did his master’s.“In the first year of college, I had to pay Rs 1,000 as fees and hostel charges. The fees was halved after the results of my first-year exams. For master’s,  I received a scholarship from  a college fund that took care of all my expenses,” Jana said.Jana now sets aside a portion of his salary every month to help poor but meritorious students.Jana has been receiving donations from former students of Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, and Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur, to reach out to the needy.",2020-10-05 22:00:00
1777,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: App cab driver to fishmonger  - Telegraph India,"An app cab driver now sells fish to run his family because he doesn’t know when and if cabs would return to roads.Balaram Nag used to set out early in the morning till March 22 with a Tata Zest while his smartphone would locate a passenger. He still sets out early; but on a cycle to earn a living.He cycles to the wholesale fish market in Sodepur and buys fish at the morning auction “at a reasonable rate”. He then crisscrosses the streets of Belghoria on the city’s northern outskirts while hawking the fish.“I have taken the cycle from a friend on rent,” Nag, a resident of Kabi Chandi Charan Mitra Street in Belghoria, said.The car he used to drive is gathering dust in the owner’s garage along Tobin Road off BT Road.“I was on the Ola app cab platform for the past four years. My monthly income was around Rs 15,000. But the lockdown has struck me hard, turning me into a fishmonger,” he said.“I am earning less than a fourth of what I used to earn on the Ola platform. Had the system remained active, we might have got calls. The number of rides has dropped drastically, though, and I don’t think it would have been  enough,” he said.The wholesale fish market close to his home is shut and he has to go to Sodepur, 3km away. Nag said he felt scared that police would catch him and send him back home. “We have to survive. My wife is a homemaker. Or else, we will starve to death. Now, I earn barely Rs 100 a day.”The app cab rides started dropping from the middle of March and stopped entirely from March 22.“People are buying less. Prices, too, have skyrocketed…. When I had started in April, my daily income ranged between Rs 200 and Rs 250. Now, it is down to Rs 100,” he said.A fall in income means he cannot go to the wholesale market daily to buy fish, he said.He is not alone to witness this reversal of fortune. He has a business partner, Shambhu Mandal, who used to ply an e-rickshaw (toto) in Belghoria before the travel restrictions were enforced.Mandal’s wife works as a domestic help as he joins Nag in hawking fish. “But that doesn’t help… many houses have barred help from entering homes on grounds of health hazard,” Mandal said.",2020-10-05 22:10:00
1779,Suranjan Das,Hari Vasudevan: Amiable master of historian's craft  - Telegraph India,"History professor Suranjan Das, vice-chancellor of Jadavpur University, remembers historian Hari Vasudevan who passed away on Sunday.To write something about the passing of Professor Hari Vasudevan, my friend, colleague and adviser for more than four decades, is painful and difficult.A distinguished academic,  holding a Tripos and a PhD from Cambridge, he had an extraordinary mastery over the “historian’s craft”.  Initially, he demonstrated his remarkable expertise in European, especially Russian and French, history.  But in his later years, he became involved with unearthing documents on Netaji from Russian archives and exploring facets of India’s foreign policy, especially its neighbourhood policy.He served the history department of Calcutta University with distinction, as a teacher, research superviser, reformer of the teaching-learning process and a source of sustenance for his colleagues, students and employees in times of need.He was the prime mover in establishing at Calcutta University the Peace Studies Group, the Institute of Foreign Policy Studies and the Area Studies Programme, which enabled the University to create a new niche in the world of learning.  An entire generation of students and scholars has learnt how to read and write history from Professor Vasudevan, and his contribution to the discipline we share.  Hari had an exceptionally broad and tolerant mind, which is increasingly becoming rare.I also recall here how Hari would unhesitatingly offer me advice and help when I served the Calcutta University as pro vice-chancellor for academic affairs and the vice-chancellor. Hari demonstrated his administrative skill, too, during his tenure as the director of Maulana Azad Institute of Asian Studies, where I had the opportunity to be by his side as a member of its executive committee.More than our professional relationship, what remains most important to me is the warmth and humour that Hari brought to me and my family.  My daughter would miss the cakes and scones that Hari never failed to bring for her, especially when he could come to see her Christmas Tree decorations; my wife would no longer have someone to whom she could complain about me.For me, the absence of Hari would be an irreparable personal loss.  This has been a particularly difficult time for me; when within a span of 17 months, I lost two of my best friends, who also happened to be historians: Professor Mushirul Hasan in December 2018 and now Professor Hari Vasudevan. What is worse, I will not even be able to pay my last respects to Hari because of the unusual circumstances in which we are living.My heart goes out to his daughter Mrinalini and his wife Tapati, incidentally a friend from the wonderful Presidency College days. With the passing away of Hari, we will be deprived of a wonderful human being.",2020-10-05 23:06:00

It is also important to check if there are gaps in implementing micro-management plans within containment zones. Extensive public education campaigns are theneed of the hour,” said a senior corporation  official.The civic body prepares a micro-plan for all containment zones to ensure that new cases do not emerge from the area. A containment zone is usually a neighbourhood surrounding a house from where someone has tested positive for Covid-19. People are not allowed to step out of a containment zone and outsiders are not allowed to enter.",2020-10-05 23:13:00
1783,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Preschool fee plea to parents - Telegraph India,"An association of heads of preschools and parents has requested parents to pay the fees to preschools and daycare facilities because these are “unaided centres” that “survive” on fees. The letter of appeal from the Early Childhood Association, which has 40-odd preschools, individual heads and many parents as members in the city, to parents has been shared on social media, webinars and in various member groups across the country. “It’s time to think about these preschools and daycare centres, that your child attends, how will they survive without fees? These are private, unaided centres and the only way they survive is basis of fees. Early Childhood Association (ECA) requests all parents to please support their child’s preschool and daycare centre by paying fees and on time,” says the letter issued by the association’s national committee. The association has also said that parents facing any kind of financial difficulty should reach out to the child’s preschool and daycare. The letter says: “... ask for a solution but please do not disconnect from your child’s preschool and daycare”.Preschools and daycare facilities can use the letter to motivate parents to pay the fees, the association has said.“Some schools had got in touch with us  because they have been facing issues with non-payment of fees and hence the association appealed to parents. We are circulating the appeal as widely as possible. How will standalone schools survive if fees are not paid? The teachers are reaching out to the children online as well,” said Suman Sood, the national core committee member of ECA and mentor of Calcutta, Odisha and Kerala territories. Metro had reported last week how the lockdown had hit preschools and daycare centres in the city with many parents withdrawing children and hardly any new admissions. Some schools also complained that parents had stopped paying fees.The association has also said that the preschool gives the child the “much required foundation for life and learning”, and a daycare facility  gives the parents the ease to contribute to their economic growth by working and leaving the child in safe care.“You will need these centres even more now, once we reopen, so let’s not allow them to shut down because of lack of fees. These preschools and daycares are not only using these fees for teachers’ salaries but also for salaries of support staff, rent and also to invest in the required safety and hygiene measures that will be required once they reopen,” the letter said.",2020-10-05 23:40:00
1785,Mita Mukherjee,Will examine proposal to waive certain fee: Archbishop of Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Archbishop of Calcutta Reverend Thomas D’ Souza told Metro on Wednesday that schools under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta would “definitely” examine the recommendation of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian schools to consider waiver of “certain fees”.“The association (Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools in India), I am told, had made some recommendations about the tuition fees and some other fees…. Our schools have not taken any decision on the recommendation yet. But we will definitely do that very soon. We will examine whether it is possible to consider certain fees,” the archbishop said.“On one hand, we have to be sympathetic towards our parents, on the other we have to be fair to our teachers,” he added.The archbishop said: “The association cannot take a decision on fees. The founder bodies and the managing committees of the individual schools can only take a decision on students’ fees.”The archbishop is the head of all Roman Catholic churches, many of which run reputable Anglo-Indian schools in Calcutta. But decisions on all administrative matters of the schools are taken by the founder bodies and managing committees of the individual institutions.Reverend D’ Souza said he had been informed that the association had discussed fees among other issues at its meeting on Monday and proposed to recommend the schools to consider the annual fees, mostly for services that are not applicable when students are not going to school for a prolonged period.The Methodist Church, too, told Metro it would consider waiving fees “that are not relevant now when the schools are not operating”.Reverend Kamalaksha Sardar, the secretary of the founder bodies of schools under Methodist churches, said he had yet to know the details of the outcome of the meeting of the heads of Anglo-Indian schools.“But I personally feel there should not be any problem to consider the fees that are not relevant now. We have rolled back the enhanced fees. We have not asked parents who are in difficulty to pay the fees. We can also consider some other fees like sports or games fees,” said Reverend Sardar.Calcutta Boys’, Calcutta Girls’, Mount Hermon and Methodist Church School, Dankuni, are some of the schools run by the Methodists.Reverend Sardar said: “The decision (on fees) will have to be taken by the respective founder bodies.”St Xavier’s, Loreto, Don Bosco, St Lawrence, St Mary’s, St Teresa, Aloysius and Loyola High are some of the Roman Catholic schools in the city. All of them will be at liberty to take their own decision on the fees.The executive committee of the Bengal branch of the Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools had held a meeting on Monday where, among other issues, the problem faced by several Anglo-Indian schools because of non-payment of students’ fees by parents since April was discussed. The committee had decided not to give any discount to parents on the monthly tuition fees because most of the teacher salaries are sourced from this amount.The association had proposed to recommend the governing boards of schools to reduce some fees that were not applicable because the schools are not operational.The Church of North India had on Tuesday pulled  the nine schools out of the association, saying the association had no authority to take any decision on fees.Before the pullout, the association had 60-odd institutions.Reverend Paritosh Canning, the bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI, had said: “…The Association of Heads of Anglo Indian Schools in India (AHAISI) West Bengal branch, is not authorised to deal with matters relating to the fee structure of their schools. This is solely decided by the board (of the respective schools), duly approved by the chairman (of the board).”The bishop is the chairman of the governing boards of all the CNI schools.“The association… has no authority to comment regarding waiver of any fee payable, by our schools, which are governed directly by the Bishop of Calcutta, CNI,” the bishop said.Sources in the CNI said not everyone in their fold agreed to the decision to withdraw membership from the association.The schools, however, are unanimous that the association cannot force any decision on the fees on them.A section of the CNI had tried to reason with the bishop that even if they were opposed to the fee waiver proposal, they should not withdraw the membership.Several Anglo-Indian institutions which are not part of the CNI said they were planning to “take a look at some of the fees”, sources in the schools said.",2020-10-06 23:10:00

1787,Subhajoy Roy,L&T to build new Tallah bridge - Telegraph India,"Larsen and Toubro (L&T) will build the new Tallah bridge, which could be ready for use by February 2022 if everything moves according to plan, officials of the public                                                                                                                                  works department said on Wednesday.The private infrastructure company was given the contract to build the bridge on June 5, the day it signed an agreement with the PWD.The contract states that the company has 18 months from the time it starts work to finish the project.PWD engineers as well as L&T officials said construction could start towards the end of July. “Eighteen months from July-end will stretch till February 2022. The bridge is likely to be ready by then if everything moves according to the plan,” a PWD official said.The new bridge would cost the state government Rs 350 crore. The government will have to make an additional payment to the railways for using its land — a portion of the bridge will run over railway tracks.The demolition of the old bridge, which had lost much  of its strength and was in danger of collapse, began in February and was over by May. The demolition proceeded smoothly because of the lockdown because trucks that ferried debris from the spot could move quickly, the PWD official said.An L&T official said the length of the main trunk of the new bridge — stretching between the Shyambazar-end and the Paikpara-end — will be 610m, almost identical to the old bridge.“The stretch over the railway tracks will be 240m long. The approach from the Shyambazar-end will be 180m long and the descent towards the Paikpara-end will be 190m long,” the L&T official said. A 187m-long arm will descend towards Chitpore.PWD engineers said the alignment of the new bridge would be identical to the old one. Design-wise, the new bridge will be a bow-string structure.“In a bow-string structure, a bow-like component which a person can see overhead while travelling through the bridge takes the load and transfers it down,” said a civil engineer. The bow-string structure will ensure that minimum space is taken to build piers on railway land,” a PWD engineer said.“This will allow future expansion of railway lines through that place. If railways have more free land, it can plan more routes.”Like the old bridge, the new bridge, too, will have footpaths — 1.5m wide — on either side.Among the bow-string bridges in Calcutta are the ones over Tolly’s Nullah near Tollygunge Phari and the portion of the Parama flyover that runs above railway tracks.Engineers said soil investigation was being done at the Tallah site now. The soil investigation is necessary to know the strength and composure of the soil.Commissioned in 1962, the decision to pull down the Tallah bridge was taken after the highway division of RITES, a subsidiary of the railways, had informed the Bengal government that the structure was not fit even for pedestrians.The state government sought a second opinion from an independent expert, who also suggested demolition of the bridge. The old bridge had strands of steel ducts supporting its underbelly.Engineers who inspected the bridge said many of the strands had snapped, which means they no longer had the ability to bear the load. “In such a situation, the bridge could have collapsed even if there was no extra load on it,” said one engineer.",2020-10-06 23:12:00
1789,Subhankar Chowdhury,Please don’t hike school fees: Mamata Banerjee - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday requested private schools not to hike fees this year because “people don’t have money to spend”.“I would request private schools not to hike fees this year, considering that people are facing hardships now,” Mamata told a news conference at Nabanna.“Please don’t increase the fees or extra charges as people will face inconvenience. People don’t have money to spend. We saw the impact of two or three (decisions). One is demonetisation (notebandi), the other is lockdown (gharbandi). During demonetisation, people were left without cash. During lockdown, you still have your ghar (home) but arranging two meals is difficult,” the chief minister said.There are two components in school fees, monthly and annual. The annual fees are linked to co-curricular activities and practicals, like computer classes, Internet and library facilities, sports, electricity and session charges.Parents are concerned about paying the fees at a time when the economy has gone into a slump because of the pandemic. Many parents have had to take pay cuts and their jobs are insecure.An official of the school education department said they hoped the private schools would pay heed to the chief minister’s appeal.Metro had reported on Tuesday about a meeting of the association of Anglo Indian school heads that discussed possible waivers in school fees during the financial crisis triggered by the pandemic. ",2020-10-06 23:14:00
1790,Snehal Sengupta,New Town gears up to expand cycling space - Telegraph India,"Cycle tracks in New Town will be widened and new ones built with signage asking cyclists to stick to the tracks.The bicycle has made a comeback on the city’s streets with many preferring to pedal to work and avoid travelling on overcrowded buses.In New Town, unlike parts of Calcutta, cycle tracks run along the service lanes of the Major Arterial Road in several places. And now the authorities will make more space for bicycles by placing orange traffic cones on the extreme left flank of the service roads in the township.The tracks had been built in 2016 and have signage to demarcate them from the walking space. As they are a bit elevated from the main road, motorists cannot get on them.An official of the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), which built the tracks, said they would build more cycling tracks and increase the width of existing ones.The cycling tracks in the township total around 29km.“This is the only part of the city where cycling is actively encouraged as a means of transportation. As several office-goers are using bicycles to commute, we have decided to increase the width of the existing tracks,” said the official.The concrete tracks have space for two cycles to travel to and fro. After widening, four cycles, two in each direction, could ply.The official said wherever feasible, the cyclists’ lane would be made on the extreme left flank of service roads.Debashis Sen, the chairman-cum-managing director of Hidco, said they had a bigger picture in mind.A plan has been drawn up listing major residential areas and major office hubs and malls.“We want to wean people away from cars and bikes, which cause pollution. We have made a detailed transport plan that includes the New Town Metro stations as well. We are making the tracks in such a way that once Metro is operational, commuters should be able to cycle to a Metro station, park it there and head to office. We have consulted IIT Kharagpur regarding this and they have come up with a plan to make last mile connectivity possible through cycles,” he said.Hidco, Sen said, will also reintroduce the cycle-sharing scheme that was quite popular in New Town.A tender for the scheme, which will include battery-powered cycles, has been floated but the project has got delayed because of the pandemic.In Sector V, too, the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority has started scouting for lanes that can be made into cycling tracks.Dhritiman Sarkar, deputy commissioner, traffic, Bidhannagar commissionerate, said cycles in New Town could ply without hampering the general traffic flow. “Unlike in other parts of the city, there are tracks for cyclists here. We will not allow them on flyovers,” Sarkar said.Two of the most popular tracks are along the Major Arterial Road.If one is approaching from Salt Lake, the first cycle track begins after the box bridge connecting Sector V and New Town.It is on the left flank of the road from East Enclave housing complex and passes in front of the Coal Bhawan, DLF Building, Nazrul Tirtha, Animikha complex, Eastern Grove complex and ends at New Town bus terminus. It is a 1km-long stretch.The second cycle track is in front of Eco Park from Gate 1 to Gate 4.

Our men are looking for them,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, the chief wildlife warden of the state.Fishing cat, baghrol in local parlance, is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and included in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Killing the animal can lead to a jail term of five years.The nocturnal animal thrives in wetlands and feeds mostly on fish. Shrinking wetlands has dwindled their numbers and forced them to stray to human settlements and prey on fish farmed in ponds and livestock.The latest casualty was reported by a couple of local volunteers of HEAL (Human and Environment Alliance League), an NGO that works for animals. “A fishing cat was killed by some residents in the area in 2018. This is a repeat offence. The new victim was an adult male,” said Tiasa Adhya, a member of HEAL, who has been researching on fishing cats for close to a decade.A volunteer at Renjura said he was headed to a tea stall around 6.30am on Wednesday when he saw a fishing cat trapped in a cage. “A crowd had gathered around the cage. I told the villagers the fishing cat was an endangered animal and should be handed to the forest department. I informed the department as well as HEAL members in Calcutta,” the volunteer said over the phone.Most villagers agreed to the proposal and the man went back home, only to be informed a couple of hours later that the animal had been killed. The man later called up the police, as did the members of the NGO in Calcutta. By the time the cops and foresters reached the spot, the trap and the remains of the animal were missing.“The villagers killed the animal to eat its meat,” said HEAL secretary Suvrajyoti Chatterjee.Arup Mukherjee, the divisional forest officer of Kharagpur, under whose jurisdiction the area fell, said a team of forest officials was at the spot. “The additional divisional forest officer and the ranger of Belda are at the spot for investigation. The local police are also assisting us. But we are yet to come across any live or dead animal or remains of its carcass.”",2020-10-06 23:25:00

Little has been done to rein in the cable rogues, and multiple threats by officials have fallen on deaf ears. The post-cyclone clean-up offers a chance to bring order to the cable jungle but it cannot be done without political will.Filmmaker appeals for reliefFilmmaker Shoojit Sircar on Tuesday appealed to various Durga Puja organising committees to opt for a low-key celebration this year and use the funds to rebuild the state which was recently hit by Cyclone Amphan.The tropical cyclone struck several districts of Bengal and Odisha on May 20, leaving 98 people dead and causing large-scale destruction to property in both states.Sircar requested the organisers of the festival, one of the largest in Bengal, to donate all the expenses for a better cause.

The institute is sanitising the school compound every day as some staff members and the principal are visiting it. “The security personnel are doing thermal screening and hand sanitisation of everyone entering the school premises. Putting on face mask and sanitising one’s hands are compulsory on the premises,” he said.The management of Hindmotor High School and HM Education Centre has adopted a sympathetic approach towards the schools’ parents amidst the pandemic. They have reduced the fee structure and also waived off the tuition fee for a month. “We gave special concessions to a few parents, who couldn’t afford to pay the fees. We also allowed a few students, whose parents haven’t yet been able to pay the fees, to attend online classes regularly,” said Sudipta Bose, rector-cum-manager of HM schools.The schools have also implemented measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 on the school premises. “Since some maintenance work is going on, we have been carrying out the sanitisation process in the compound regularly. We have also distributed masks to the community at large,” said Bose.The schools have been conducting online classes for all the students from nursery to Class XII. “Our teachers are working full time and conducting regular classes online,” said Bose.St Augustine’s Day School, Barrackpore, recently organised its first online annual prize day celebrations. Students of classes VI to XII, along with their parents, were part of the event that started with a welcome song and prayer. The participants performed from their homes. The event was divided into two sessions, involving the middle and senior schools. MP Birla Planetarium director (research and academic) Debiprasad Duari was the chief guest for the middle school, while surgeon Kunal Sarkar presided over the senior school’s celebrations. Principal Jhuma Biswas said online classes had started since April. “Parents and students are quite used to the set-up by now, and most of them log in for all online events.

1798,"Subhajoy Roy, Bishwarup Dutta",Coronavirus outbreak: Stock in banks deplete as virus fear takes toll on donation camps - Telegraph India,"A sharp drop in the number of blood donation camps because of the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a crisis in availability of blood in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal, family members of patients, doctors and blood bank officials have said.On Sunday, Metro found long queues in front of counters of several blood banks in the city. Most people in the queues were told by blood bank officials that there was no guarantee they would get blood even after waiting for hours.Many of them said they were running from one blood bank to another for a few units of blood.Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic hit India, the number of blood donation camps has kept decreasing. As time passed, the situation worsened, said officials of multiple blood banks. Almost all banks are supplying blood only if those in need are able to bring donors, said family members of patients as well as blood bank officials.Gairik Chakraborty, a resident of Patipukur, needed three units of blood for his mother, who was admitted to a hospital on Saturday. Chakraborty reached the Central Blood Bank in Maniktala on Sunday morning with two donors. He had hoped that he would get two units in return.“The officials at the counter told me there was no guarantee that I would get blood even after I took along two donors. I did not wait any longer and went to another blood bank. They agreed to give me two units in return of the blood the donors would give,” he said.Suman Pal, a thalassemia patient, was waiting outside a blood bank in Hazra. The 22-year-old, who needs one unit of blood three to four times a month, said he was having a donor accompany him every time he underwent transfusion over the past four months.He said he had been collecting blood from the Hazra blood bank ever since he was six months old and all employees there knew him well. “Despite knowing me so well they are unable to give me blood if I fail to bring along a donor. Such is the crisis,” he said.The shortage of blood is also being felt at hospitals. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, the daily requirement of blood during the pre-Covid times was 10 to 15 units. The hospital’s blood bank would always store another 10 to 15 units to meet emergency requirements.Over the past four months, the requirement has remained the same but the emergency stock has gone down to four or five units.“We have only four or five units of blood at any given point in time after meeting the daily requirement of patients in our hospital. We are being able to maintain this minimum stock because some patients’ families are bringing donors. It has become difficult to procure blood from outside, too, because most blood banks in the city have gone dry,” said Biju Pillai, who is in charge of the blood bank at the hospital.Pillai’s exasperation was echoed by officials of other blood banks, too. Anu Ganguly, one of the directors of Life Care, said the blood bank used to have a daily stock of about 500 units in the first half of August till last year.“Usually, there is no shortage of blood around this time of the year. The stock would go up post-Independence Day because many blood donation camps would be organised that day. But this year the blood bank has about 10 to 15 units in stock in the first half of August,” Ganguly said.“We are asking people to bring replacement donors… otherwise our stock would become zero. If someone needs blood from a group that the blood bank does not possess, we are asking the family to bring a donor of that group.”While the demand for blood has remained steady, the supply has gone down manifold. Doctors said patients suffering from thalassemia, haemophilia, cell disorders or blood cancer routinely need blood transfusion. They are among the worst-hit.Even Covid-19 patients who have other illnesses such as chronic kidney disease or are anaemic need a few units of blood at times. Ajoy Krishna Sarkar, a critical care expert who is treating Covid-19 patients, said: “Suppose there is a Covid-19 patient whose haemoglobin count is 6. Sometimes, they need a few units of blood.”Social activists who organise blood donation camps, doctors as well blood bank officials attributed the crisis to the fact that no blood donation camp was being held in the city. Political parties, clubs and social welfare organisations used to take the lead in organising such camps. But most people are staying away from organising camps because of the pandemic.“The few camps that have been held did not get the expected response. If the organisers thought there would be 50 donors, only 15 turned up. Besides, getting permission to organise camps is becoming difficult because the authorities fear people would violate the precautionary measures,” said D. Ashis, who organises blood donation camps every year.Ten people travelling in a Tata Ace were injured after the vehicle collided with a truck on Kidderpore Road, off the Maidan, early on Sunday.

1799,Our Special Correspondent,Extortion cuffs on civic volunteer - Telegraph India,"A 22-year-old youth who worked as a civic volunteer in the Calcutta police has been arrested for allegedly trying to extort money posing as a guard of a deputy commissioner in the city police.Police said Santu Sarkar, a resident of Jodhpur Gardens, and his uncle Shyamal Biswas were arrested for allegedly running an extortion racket and trying to extort money from a resident of Rahim Ostagar Lane, in the Jodhpur Park area.The police said they were alerted about Sarkar after a member of the board of administrators of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation received a call on Friday night. The caller, who claimed that he was the guard of a deputy commissioner, complained that the staff of an agency hired by the parking wing of the civic body was harassing him for illegal parking fees though he was driving a “police vehicle”.“When I asked him to report the matter to the police, he said he was not sure whether the cops would act. That made me feel suspicious. If he were a policeman, why would he say such a thing?” said Ratan De, a member of the board of administrators of the CMC.“When I questioned him, he became furious and threatened me by dropping the names of senior police officers. I disconnected the phone and reported the matter to the local police station.”The second complaint against Sarkar was lodged with Lake police station by a resident of Rahim Ostagar Lane. The complainant alleged that Sarkar had tried to extort Rs 2,000 from him by threatening him with dire consequences impersonating as a police officer.Officers learnt during investigation that Sarkar was neither the guard of any IPS officer nor attached to the division where he said he had been posted. “He was attached to a police station in the south-east division as a civic volunteer,” said an officer.Sarkar and his uncle were arrested on charges of extortion, cheating, common intention and wrongful restraint on Saturday. Officers said Sarkar would be suspended because of the criminal case against him.There have been several cases where civic volunteers have tried to extort money from people citing their connections in the police department.“It is advisable to verify the identity of the person if someone claims to be a police officer or attached to a senior officer as guard,” a senior officer in the city police said.The police said they were checking if there were any other complaints or cases against Sarkar or his uncle in the crime records section.",2020-10-08 02:03:00
1800,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Presidency University entry based on board marks - Telegraph India,"Presidency University will admit students to its undergraduate courses this year on the basis of board marks as admission tests cannot be held because of the Covid-19 pandemic, an official of the university said.The university decided on the admission model after going through the feedback teachers submitted to their departmental heads. Vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia had asked the teachers to share their feedback after being told by the JEE board that it could not hold the admission test on behalf of Presidency this year.“The tests cannot be held online because of connectivity issues. So, they have suggested admissions through board marks,” said an official.  Sources on the campus said the teachers of the physics and chemistry departments had proposed that apart from factoring in plus-II board marks, the scores in physical science and math in Madhyamik be considered, given that the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education could not hold tests in the papers because of the pandemic.The students had the best marks in the papers they had written awarded to the ones they could not.“If we admit students based on the marks in physics so obtained, we will have no idea how proficient a student is in the subject. So we have suggested that marks in physical science and math in Madhyamik be also considered,” said a physics teacher.A chemistry teacher said the same concern had prompted them to propose that the marks in the science papers in Madhyamik be considered.“We need to have as many screening layers as possible, considering that the candidates across boards have notched up high marks at the plus-II level. The physical science paper in Madhyamik has chapters on chemistry. So the marks in the paper should also be considered,” said a teacher.The biological science department has proposed that the merit list be only based on the plus-II board marks. The marks in life science or related papers in Madhyamik or equivalent board exams would be considered only to break ties.“The chances of the scores getting tied are higher this time. Therefore, we have proposed that the scores from the secondary board marks be taken into account to break ties,” said a teacher.At Presidency, the political science department has proposed that they will admit students on the basis of the board marks at the secondary and the higher secondary levels. The sociology and the economics departments want to prepare the merit list based only on plus-II board marks.A clear picture on whether board-specific rules have to be made will emerge after the admission committee meets this week, said an official.VC Lohia said in a text message to The Telegraph that decisions about the mode of admissions would be announced this week.Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, in Belur, which too has been forced to scrap admissions tests, will give additional weightage to participants in math Olympiads and national talent search exams for admission to undergraduate math and physics courses.

The decision to postpone the JEE Main exams, usually held in April, to the first week of September because of the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted the board to stagger the counselling schedule.The NITs and the IIEST, Shibpur, among other institutes, admit students through the JEE Main.Ten per cent of the seats in Bengal’s private engineering colleges are set aside for those who crack the JEE Main so that vacancies could be minimised. The 86 private engineering colleges in Bengal can admit 28,493 students to their undergraduate courses.A notice uploaded on the Bengal JEE board’s website says: “There will be two separate counselling: 1) for those WBJEE-rank holders for all those seats except those reserved for JEE-main candidates and 2) for JEE-Main rank holders and for those seats (in architecture) that require National Aptitude Test in Architecture score.”The rescheduled JEE Main exams are to be held from September 1 to 6.“This year, the counselling for students whose names figure on the state JEE merit list is likely to start on August 12. The counselling for the JEE Main students and those aspiring to pursue BTech in architecture would be held later,” said Dibyendu Kar, the JEE board registrar.The counselling for the state JEE-rank holders will be held in at least three rounds.A board official said that according to rules of the Architecture Council of India, an architecture aspirant has to crack the Bengal JEE and the National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) or the paper-II of the JEE Main.The first test of NATA has been scheduled for August 28. The date of the second test is yet to be decided.“Until these tests are over, the counselling for admission to the architecture course cannot be held. The engineering colleges in the state together have 141 seats in architecture,” said Dilip Mitra, the vice-chairman of the JEE board.What if the JEE Main cannot be held because of the raging pandemic? “If such a situation arises, the state higher education department is authorised to decide that the 2,849 seats — the ones in the state’s private engineering colleges that are reserved for students cracking the JEE Main — be filled with students from the Bengal JEE merit list.“Seats cannot be allowed to remain vacant. However, we are not sure how the seats in the architecture could be filled in case the required tests cannot be held,” an official in the higher education department said.The JEE board will announce the counselling schedule for each round on Monday. The board will post updates on its Facebook page and YouTube about how to take part in the online counselling, which has several new features designed in the wake of the pandemic.",2020-10-08 02:07:00
1802,Debraj Mitra,Cylinders  to save Sunderbans fishermen - Telegraph India,"One hundred mini-LPG cylinders will be distributed to fishermen in the Sunderbans so that they don’t have to venture into the forests for firewood to cook on the boat during their fishing trips, said foresters.Fishermen, five or more in one boat, set out to catch fish from the rivers surrounding the mangrove delta. The journeys typically last over a week. The daily catch is stored in ice boxes on the boats.Every now and then, the boats are anchored and the men enter the forests to collect firewood for cooking on the boat. Tigers cannot attack a boat on the river but inside the forests, the men are vulnerable to attacks, said forest officials.In the first lot, 25 mini-LPG cylinders with stoves fitted atop were provided to as many licensed fishing boats in the Basirhat division of the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve on Friday.“For now, the pilot project will cover 100 boat license certificate (BLC)-holders in the tiger reserve,” said Tapas Das, the field director of the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve.“The traditional earthen stoves run on dry firewood. In the wet conditions in the Sunderbans, it is difficult to find dry firewood unless one ventures deep into the forest. Whenever they run out of firewood, fishermen are forced to anchor the boat and enter deep into the forest with sharp tools. That increases the risk of conflict, making both the tigers and the men vulnerable. This project aims to enable the fishermen to cook on their boats without having to enter the forests,” said Joydip Kundu of the Society for Heritage & Ecological Research (SHER), an NGO that works to reduce human-wildlife conflict.The cylinders are being supplied by the organisation. The forest department has prepared the list of recipients and is coordinating the distribution. Each cylinder comes with a stove and a metal case for support to provide stability in choppy waters.“A boat usually stays on the river for a week to 10 days. Each cylinder would last a fortnight. After that, it has to be refuelled,” said Kundu.Sources in the forest department said over 10 persons have died in tiger attacks in the Sunderbans this year. Though no official record is available, researchers working on tiger attacks feel there have been about 3,000 such deaths since the 1980s.A man was killed in a tiger attack on August 2. Another was killed in the second week of June.“If the project is successful, it can be a model for the entire Sunderbans. But it has to be implemented efficiently,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, the chief wildlife warden of Bengal.The onus would be on ensuring that the fishermen use these cylinders on the boat and don’t keep them at home, he said.The Sunderbans is spread across 10,000sq km, a little above 4,000sq km of which is in India. The rest is in Bangladesh. The Indian Sunderbans is split between the tiger reserve and the South 24-Parganas division. There are around 3,000 BLC holders in the Indian Sunderbans, the tiger reserve and the South 24-Parganas division combined, a forest department official said.",2020-10-08 02:07:00

The new criteria for selecting teachers for the award were included to ascertain how effectively teachers are reaching out to the students, who are now confined in homes,” the official said.A teacher of a state-aided secondary school who is an applicant for the award this year said he had to mention in the application the number of relief missions he had joined during the pandemic and after Amphan, the total number of online classes he had taken between March and July 31, the number of students he had taught and whether he had offered to visit a student’s home to provide him or her extra help in understanding lessons.This year the Shiksha Ratna award will be presented to 40 primary and secondary teachers from state-aided schools.

1804,Sanjay Mandal,Cashless insurance trap over hospital deposit - Telegraph India,"Many private hospitals in Calcutta on Sunday said they would seek a Rs 50,000 deposit even from patients with cashless insurance policies, highlighting that the state regulatory commission’s day-old advisory allowing deposits stipulated no exceptions.Saturday’s advisory from the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission has capped the deposits at Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated bill, whichever was less.On Sunday, commission chairperson and retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee told The Telegraph that the exception for holders of cashless policies was implied. “The private hospitals cannot demand deposits during admission from patients with cashless insurance policies. Otherwise what’s the point of someone having such coverage?” he said.But officials with several hospitals and insurance companies contended that since the advisory contained no clause saying deposits could not be demanded from beneficiaries of cashless insurance policies, the hospitals would be justified in seeking deposits from such policy holders.Asked, Banerjee said such policy holders can lodge a complaint with the commission through email if a hospital demands a deposit.Sudipta Mitra, chief executive of Peerless Hospital, said: “There is no separate mention of insurance patients in the advisory. So, it is clear that there is no bar on seeking deposits from patients under cashless insurance coverage.”A clause in the agreement between a particular private hospital in Calcutta and the preferred provider network —a consortium of four insurance companies — states the hospital should admit insured patients without seeking any deposit or advance payment.“Now the state government's new advisory will override this clause, like it happened with the personal protective equipment rates the patients are charged for,” an official of the hospital said.When the Covid-19 epidemic broke out, the private hospitals began charging varying amounts for the PPE kits their healthcare workers had to wear to treat the patients. This prompted chief minister Mamata Banerjee to cap the PPE charges at Rs 1,000 per patient per day, and the hospitals and insurance companies abided by it.Several hospitals, including Peerless, said their agreements with insurance companies had no clause about not seeking deposits from cashless policy holders, anyway.“We have been seeking deposits from patients within the limit of Rs 50,000 from the start of the Covid-19 outbreak to keep the hospital viable,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO of Belle Vue Clinic.“Patients with cashless insurance benefits are also being asked to pay the deposit during admission. This is because disputes often break out over payment of the amount not approved by the insurance company.”Tondon said that when a hospital sends a patient’s bill to the TPA or third-party administrator, the insurance company usually refuses to pay a portion of it --  particularly the charges relating to bed occupancy, certain investigations and the use of equipment such as gloves.“Usually, the amount not paid by the insurance companies even in the case of cashless policies varies between Rs 25,000 and Rs 1.25 lakh,” Tondon said.The CEO of another private hospital said that many patients, especially Covid-19 patients, were now refusing to pay the amount not approved by the insurer because the bills often ran into several lakhs — far beyond the sum they were insured for.“It has been an understanding of many years that hospitals would not ask for deposits from patients under insurance coverage,” said Saurav Kariwala, assistant manager (medical) with the National Insurance Company Ltd, Calcutta. “They often asked for small (deposit) amounts that we ignored. Now we fear that the deposits will become the norm.”THE CLAUSEAn agreement between a private hospital in Calcutta and the preferred provider network (PPN), a consortium of four insurance companies, states:Deposit And Advance Payments — In all fit cases meeting with the prescribed parameters for cashless admission, the Network Provider (hospital) shall admit, on priority and expeditiously, a Beneficiary to the Hospital for the purpose of Treatment without seeking any deposit or advance payment from the beneficiary or the TPA (third party administrator). (An official of the hospital said the agreement was in force till July this year and should have been renewed with the same clause by now. But because of the Covid-19 situation, the renewal has got delayed.)",2020-10-08 02:46:00

All Asia Medical Institute in Gariahat has been fined Rs 50,000.The patient’s daughter took him to the Gariahat hospital after she was pro-mised admission, but on reaching there they were apparently told no bed was available.The third hospital — R Flemming Hospital in Topsia — did not take proper care of the man after admitting him, said retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission.The patient, a resident of Hooghly’s Rishra, passed away on July 7 at a nursing home in Ekbalpore, where the family shifted him after they allegedly found that he was not getting proper care at R Flemming Hospital. He was taken to Fortis Hospital on July 3.“The man’s daughter lodged a complaint saying her father needed admission in the ICU but Fortis Hospital turned him away. During the hearing, the hospital said there was no bed available at the ICU,” said Banerjee.“We told the hospital they should have made arrangements for the man’s admission at another hospital if there was no ICU bed in their hospital. The hospital said they had tried to do so. But we felt the hospital could have done more,” the chairperson said.When the patient was taken to Fortis Hospital, he was suspected to be suffering from Covid-19. He tested positive for the disease at the Ekbalpore nursing home.An official at Fortis said: “The patient was brought to the hospital around midnight and stayed at our emergency for three hours, during which time our doctors stabilised him. We arranged for an ambulance. We also inquired with neighbouring hospitals but none had an ICU bed vacant…. We called up the family when an ICU bed became vacant in our hospital, but unfortunately the person had passed away by then,” he said.The Covid victim’s daughter told the commission that the family had called up many hospitals in the city. They either did not take calls or said they had no vacant beds.All Asia Medical Institute had promised admission but when the family took the elderly man there, the hospital refused admission.“We asked the hospital why the person who answered the call said a bed was available when no beds were vacant. We have fined them Rs 50,000,” the chairperson said.An official of All Asia Medical Institute said they would appeal against the fine.“The complainant could not give any evidence. We don’t have any record with us that shows that the patient had come to our hospital and refused admission. We had asked for some evidence so that we could inquire on our own, but the complainant was unable to give any evidence like call records or emergency unit records,” said an official of the hospital.  The patient was admitted to R Flemming Hospital after being refused admission in other places, the daughter told the commission.“But when she went to the hospital to see her father about three hours later, she found he was not receiving proper care. We have fined Flemming Hospital Rs 50,000 for their negligence,” the retired judge said.This newspaper called the phone number of the hospital mentioned on its website but none answered.The commission fined ILS, Dum Dum, Rs 1 lakh for assigning a wrong blood group to a newborn.

1807,Our Special Correspondent,Arrests for Durga Puja fake message on curfew - Telegraph India,"Two men have been arrested in Sodepur and Baranagar on the city’s northern outskirts on charges of circulating a fake message of curfew during Durga Puja on social media, police said. Raju Biswas from Ghola in Sodepur and Prabhujit Acharya from Baranagar have been booked under Section 505 (1) of the IPC and under various sections of the IT act.Section 505 (1) of the IPC deals with making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report that may cause fear or alarm the public.The two arrests came within hours of chief minister Mamata Banerjee directing the police to find out who was responsible for spreading such false messages.“Fake WhatsApp messages are doing the rounds saying visitors to pandals will not be allowed to move around at night. There has been no meeting yet with Puja organisers. How can someone say like this?” Mamata had said on Tuesday. “First, prove that the government has issued such orders. Or they should be made to box their ears and do 100 squats.”The message that made rounds claimed that the Bengal government had decided there will be curfew between 5pm and 4am from Panchami to Ekadashi, a day after the Puja is over.The message went on to specify a long list of dos and don’ts for the puja this year, including that more than five people would not be allowed inside a pandal.The state police promptly identified the message and termed it “fake” on its twitter handle before sharing it with the city police.“A rumour regarding Durga Puja is being spread through WhatsApp. No such decision has been taken. Please do not forward this message. It’s fake. Action is being taken,” the police said on its Twitter handle.On Wednesday, a team of officers started tracking the IP addresses from where the post had first come into circulation and traced them to Biswas and Acharya.“We are checking the antecedence of the accused,” an officer of the Barrackpore commissionerate said.",2020-10-09 01:51:00
1808,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Car assault case ‘internal matter’ - Telegraph India,"Abhishek Kumar Pandey, accused of assaulting and throwing a woman out of his Honda City and running over another woman while trying to flee on Saturday night, has told cops it was an “internal matter that went out of hand”.Pandey was arrested in Dum Dum on Tuesday night.He has apparently told cops he and the woman were supposed to get married in December and that they were arguing over when to buy a flat. The argument turned violent and they started hitting each other, he has apparently said.“He has claimed the woman had bitten his hand and that he, too, had slapped her when they were inside the car on Saturday night but they had no intention of going to the police against each other,” an officer in Lalbazar said.The police have sought forensic opinion to verify Pandey’s claim of the woman having bitten him, the officer said.A city court on Wednesday remanded him in police custody till September 16.Pandey’s lawyer told the court he and the woman were in a long-term relationship and that their marriage had to be postponed to December because of the pandemic. “They were having normal issues like any other couple. He wanted her to stay a little more but she wanted to go home. It was nothing serious,” the lawyer said.The police, however, said the fight was not just about going back home but about the plan to buy a flat.“He was engaged with a private insurance company. He lost his job during the lockdown. He recently joined a tea company on Shakespeare Sarani and had sought some time from the woman before he could buy a flat. This had been the bone of contention between the two for the past few weeks,” an officer who is investigating the matter said.The police have learnt during investigation that Pandey had gone to the woman’s home later on Saturday night to return her phone and other belongings. He had left them with the building’s guard.“The woman had initially tried to misguide us with a false name. She later said she wanted to save Pandey and that she had no intention of lodging any police complaint against him. But she had to involve the police because of Nilanjana Chatterjee who got grievously injured while trying to help the woman who was shouting inside the car,” the officer said.On Saturday night, the woman had told cops she had met Pandey five days ago and that his name was Amitabha Bose.Senior officers said the police would seek legal opinion on whether to charge the woman with giving false information initially to misguide cops.During investigation, the police have found that Pandey had taken shelter in a guest house in Mukundapur, around 4km from Anandapur police station, on Sunday night before checking out early in the morning the next day. He later met a lawyer in Sealdah.  His mobile phone was switched off but the GPRS on his phone was working. His movement was tracked first to the guest house and then to the Sealdah home of the lawyer, after which he had switched off the GPRS.On Tuesday night, cops could again track him to a place near Dum Dum from where he was arrested.",2020-10-09 01:53:00
1809,Debraj Mitra,"Senior citizens brave sun and showers, some fall sick, as Covid norms restricts entry into Kolkata banks - Telegraph India","A 79-year-old pensioner collapsed on the road while waiting in a snaking queue outside a branch of a nationalised bank in Serampore, in Hooghy district, on Tuesday. He had been standing for over 40 minutes.Another septuagenarian visited a nationalised bank’s Dunlop Bridge branch twice in the past five days to withdraw her pension. She returned empty-handed on both days, the queue reminding her of the “mad rush during demonetisation”.Strict enforcement of social distancing protocols inside branches has made life miserable for customers, many of them senior citizens, who have to wait for hours outside.Serpentine queues are visible mostly outside nationalised banks, where senior citizens usually keep their savings. The rush is felt more in the first and last week of every month, when pension is disbursed.Only a handful of people are being allowed inside at a time — depending on the size of the branch, its staff and the number of counters. The rest are having to brave the sun and occasional showers for a considerable period of time outside. The sweaty conditions typical of the monsoon have made things worse.Around 10.45am on Wednesday, there were around 50 people standing outside a nationalised bank’s branch in Behala’s Sarsuna. Many senior citizens were in the queue. Some of them took refuge inside nearby stalls, their positions held by younger family members.Among them was Angurbala Das, in her eighties. Das was waiting on a rickshaw as a family member stood in the queue for her. “I do not leave home at all, except for bank visits,” said Das.The mercury outside touched 33 degrees but the RealFeel was around 42 degrees.At a branch of another nationalised bank in Bansdroni, some 40-odd people were standing in the queue outside a little after 12.30pm. The Celsius and RealFeel were 34 and 43 degrees, respectively.“I had to wait for 90 minutes before I could enter. All I needed was an interest certificate,” said Uttam Raha, 69.The people in the queue questioned the logic of having to wait for an hour to deposit a cheque or update a passbook.The days of complete lockdown in the state have compounded the problem, said bankers and customers.“The state was under complete lockdown on Monday. When the bank opened after two days on Tuesday, there was a huge rush. Friday and Saturday are again complete lockdowns. I am shuddered to think of the rush when the bank re-opens on Tuesday,” said a manager of a nationalised bank.The social distancing norms are being implemented according to the capacity of each branch. A 4,000sq feet branch with seven counters is allowing around 15 people at once. A 1,000sq ft branch with three counters is only allowing six people at a time.“Broadly, we are trying to ensure that a one-metre distance is maintained between two persons,” said an official of a nationalised bank in New Alipore.A senior banker said the pandemic had posed new challenges. “There is a staff crunch in many banks because a number of employees have tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.Many said the queues reminded them of the days of demonetisation. “I had the same feeling on both days I went to the bank. The very sight of so many people standing outside and no one knowing when their turn would come,” said a septuagenarian woman from Dunlop, who returned empty-handed from her bank on both days.A senior banker and a member of the State Level Bankers Committee in Bengal, which coordinates between the government and the banks, acknowledged the hardships senior citizens were facing.“Senior citizens are not comfortable using ATM cards and Net or mobile banking. They still prefer withdrawing cash from the counter,” he said. His bank has started “exclusive counters” for senior citizens at some branches, he said. “The counters are operational for around 10 days a month, when the rush of pensioners is maximum.”The queues get longer as one moves further away from Calcutta. The nationalised bank in Serampore, outside which the 79-year-old man collapsed on Monday, sees people queue up since 8am on several days. Banks open at 10am.“The customer base in a branch in the suburb is more than an urban branch. The city has more business and the branch penetration is more in urban areas. Because of the reduced penetration in semi-urban and rural areas, the number of customers in each branch is more,” said an official in the regional head office of a nationalised bank.",2020-10-09 01:56:00
1810,Sanjay Mandal,Surgeries deferred as patients test Covid positive in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Planned surgeries are getting cancelled because patients are testing positive for Covid-19 during routine investigations, doctors and officials at a number of hospitals said.Last Saturday at Peerless Hospital, three laparoscopic cholecystectomies (procedures to remove gallbladder and gallstones) were postponed because all three patients tested positive for Covid-19 in routine screening.At the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, three out of six scheduled renal transplants last week had to be deferred because the patients had tested positive for Covid-19. None of them had symptoms, said an official of the hospital.Patients in need of surgeries and procedures for a number of ailments, including cancer and renal failure, were staying away from hospitals during the lockdown and immediately after it was lifted for fear of catching the coronavirus.Such people are now slowly going back to hospitals. But many of them are testing positive for Covid-19 in routine screening and are having their procedures deferred.Doctors said that except for emergency cases, they are waiting for patients to test negative for Covid before scheduling their procedures. “This is being done for patients’ safety because the coronavirus damages lungs and surgeries could be life-threatening in such situations,” said a doctor.“In the past week, we had about 10 surgeries deferred, including renal transplant, cancer, knee replacement and coronary bypass. None of the patients who tested positive for Covid had any symptoms. Surgeries can be done after the patients turn negative,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital.A man in his 60s had come to Calcutta in March for renal transplant at Peerless Hospital. The donor, his nephew, had come along with him.“The necessary clearances from the health department could not be processed because of the lockdown. Recently, the clearances came but the donor and the recipient both tested positive for Covid-19. Now, both of them are in a guesthouse, waiting to test negative,” Mitra said.At AMRI Hospitals, an elderly man had undergone neurosurgery in April. Surgeons had kept a piece of the skull bone in the abdomen and planned to replant it in the skull later.“The person had to undergo surgery to get the bone replanted. But he tested positive for Covid-19,” said Prakhar Gyanseh, a consultant in neuroanaesthesia and neurocritical care at AMRI, Dhakuria. The patient underwent the surgery last week after being cured of the coronavirus infection.A woman who had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage a few days back and was admitted to the hospital tested positive for Covid and was treated at the Covid ICU. On Thursday, the procedure to remove the clot will be done, said Gyanesh.“The number of surgeries is going up and so are the cases getting deferred. Ten per cent of my patients are testing positive for Covid before surgery,” said surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay.",2020-10-09 01:57:00
1811,Snehal Sengupta,Hawker count rises in Salt Lake - Telegraph India,"Pavements and portions of roads in Salt Lake are being fast encroached upon by hawkers selling anything from fruits to poultry.The numbers have gone up in the past couple of months as many who lost their jobs during the Covid pandemic have taken to selling fruits, vegetables and fast food to sustain themselves and their families.Most of these men and women are parking their vans on roads and some are setting up stalls on pavements.Many Salt Lake residents Metro spoke to said there had been a sharp increase in the number of pavement-grabbing stalls in all sectors of the township.Metro went around Salt Lake on Wednesday and the hawkers presiding over pavement-grabbing stalls in Sectors I, II and III are hard to miss. They were everywhere in Karunamoyee, opposite the Geological Survey of India building, in front of the Punjab National Bank rotary, lanes in several blocks such as DL and EE, and the newly renovated stretch of pavement along the Kestopur canal near AL block. Hawkers have also sprung up in front of the CGO Complex.Paritosh Duley, a resident of Kestopur who sells fruits from a pushcart and sets up his stall in AL block, said he earned a living by repairing air-conditioners before Covid struck. “I had to switch professions because there are very little work opportunities now. Most people are scared to let outsiders in. I now sell fruits to support my family,” Duley said.A glance at a 6ft wide pavement within the Karunamoyee bus stand shows the magnitude of fresh encroachments. More than a dozen illegal hawkers have set up shop there.Fruit seller Swapan Pushti, 38, said he and other hawkers had moved inside the bus stand from where the Calcutta-Dhaka service operates because it is “safer” for them to do business there.The Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation had evicted 3,000-odd hawkers and demolished stalls on pavements before the U-17 football World Cup in October 2017. Evictions were also carried out before Calcutta Book Fair in subsequent years.A civic official said no eviction drive had been conducted over the past six months.Mayor Krishna Chakraborty said they were not evicting the hawkers as most of them had lost their jobs because of the pandemic. “We are taking a softer stand because we don’t want to destroy their only means of earning something,” she said.Samaresh Bandyopadhyay, a resident of Salt Lake’s Sector II, however, said that not just pavements, even roads will be taken over if the authorities did not act against encroachments immediately. “The numbers are going up and it can turn into a situation where shops will spring up everywhere. We residents have a right to walk on pavements,” said Bandyopadhyay.",2020-10-09 02:00:00
1812,Our Bureau,Metro on Sunday for NEET candidates - Telegraph India,"Metro Railway will run a limited number of trains on Sunday for NEET aspirants, the first passenger service in 173 days since the utility had grounded its fleet on March 23 because of the Covid pandemic.“A total of 66 trains will be run (33 each from Noapara and New Garia) from 11am to 7pm at an interval of 15 minutes,” a Metro official said.“Only NEET candidates and their guardians can avail themselves of the service. They will have to show their admit cards at the gates of stations to get printed tickets. No tokens will be issued,” the official added.Over 30,000 candidates are expected to take the test at 66 centres in Calcutta. The test will be conducted from 2pm to 5pm.The state unit of the Indian Medical Association will provide NEET candidates and their family members one or two nights' accommodation at its guest houses in Calcutta. Santanu Sen, the state secretary of the association, tweeted that the accommodation would be provided at a “special discounted rate” on a ""first come first served” basis on the “previous night or the day of the examination”.Interested persons should send a message to 8240716350 before 6pm on Friday, the tweet said.The Metro service has remained suspended since March 23. There has been no formal announcement of the date of resumption of commercial service in Calcutta. But crowd control preparations with the help of technology are under way.The railway authorities will keep an eye on how Metro trains run before taking a call on resuming suburban trains, said a senior official.“We will see how Metro trains run by maintaining social distancing and crowd control protocols. They are taking the help of technology. But there are doubts on the efficacy of that technology in the open line. We will examine how the technology progresses on the ground,” Suneet Sharma, the general manager of Eastern Railway, said during a press conference on Wednesday.“Metro Railway carried 6.5 lakh passengers every day. The suburban sections of the Eastern Railway carried 30 lakh passengers every day. Metro stations have access-control facilities. Access control at the porous suburban stations is going to be very difficult. But we are in consultation with the state government. We hope something positive comes out of it,” said Sharma.“We have sent the state government crucial correspondence. Now we have to wait and see what happens once Metro trains resume,” he said.",2020-10-09 02:00:00

They don’t want another life lost to suicide.An NGO that provides telephone counselling to mentally distressed individuals has launched a campaign, Go Yellow Kolkata 2020, to spread awareness about mental health issues and to remove the stigma attached to suicide and depression.September 10 is World Suicide Prevention Day.  Lifeline Foundation Kolkata is urging people to wear yellow on Thursday in support of the movement through various online platforms. “Wear yellow and show your support to the cause,” Usha said on Wednesday.Shubhika Singh, a consultant psychologist and one of the trustees of Lifeline Foundation, said: “As a society, we have been conditioned to view emotions and mental health as a weakness. We need to collectively work to change it and sensitise each other towards normalising the conversation around mental well-being. No one should suffer in silence because of the fear of judgements and stigma.”Parno spoke of her own “depression and anxiety for many years”.“I am on medication for it. I want people to know it’s totally normal to have mental health issues. One must be open to treatment and we as a society need to change our attitude,” Mittra said.Mittra and Uthup will join an online session on Thursday in support of the movement.“We are all facing the emotional impact of Covid-19. If we as a society come together and start talking about mental health issues without any stigma, it becomes acceptable to the point of consideration and discussion,” said Suksham Singh of Lifeline Foundation.",2020-10-09 02:12:00
1814,Subhankar Chowdhury,Jadavpur University set to help students with Internet problems - Telegraph India,"Jadavpur University will give students facing Net connectivity problems smartphones and high-speed data packs ahead of the end-semester exams, scheduled for October, a university official said.The move will ensure no student is left out of the exam process for want of Net connectivity, the official said.In the third of week August, Suranjan Das, the university vice-chancellor, had requested its teachers and other employees to donate a day’s salary to help some students overcome the digital divide and attend online classes. He had requested the alumni, guardians and others to contribute so that funds could be raised to help in the process.The university has received more than Rs 12 lakh till September 8 and the money will be used to buy smartphones and high-speed data packs, a university official said.Arts and science students have started filling online forms from Tuesday for the exams that are likely to be held from October 1 to 10. The exams will be held because the results published in July following the state higher education department’s June 27 directive “stand cancelled” in view of an August 28 Supreme Court order.“We will buy students smartphones and high-speed data packs with the contribution received so far. Students will be able to write the exams and attend classes as well with this support,” Pradip Ghosh, a pro vice-chancellor, said.Ghosh is part of the 10-member committee formed on September 4 to coordinate the utilisation of the corpus “created to help students with digital devices/ connectivity”.Another member of the committee said it was crucial that the support reached students before the start of the exams as this could help them take the tests without any worries of getting question papers and sending answer scripts on time.As these students don’t have the facilities, the university has thought of engaging courier services to deliver question papers to their homes and collect answer scripts as well.“But what if the courier guy fails to deliver the papers on time? If students are provided with phone and high-speed data packs, they can receive the questions and mail back the answer scripts or send them WhatsApp like any other student,” Partha Pratim Roy, the general secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association, said.Roy is part of the committee.The university’s faculty council had on Sunday decided that those with access to the Net would receive questions by email and WhatsApp and have two hours to write the answers. Answers will have to be sent back the same way.If needed, a student can get the answer script scanned or take photographs of the answer script and mail them or send them on WhatsApp.That’s why students will get an hour to send the answers, an official said.Gour Krishna Pattanayak, the university’s finance official, said the university would meet on Thursday to take stock of the number of students who would need the help.“The departments have submitted lists. We have to go through them once so that genuine people get the help. We will then start talking to companies to get phone and high-speed data packs,”he said.Pattanayak is part of the committee.",2020-10-09 02:25:00
1815,Our Special Correspondent,Suspect in Sinthi burglaries arrested - Telegraph India,"A youth arrested in connection with a cellphone theft has been found to have been involved in four burglaries reported from the Sinthi area, in north Calcutta, over the last four months, police said.Each of the houses burgled in Sinthi has CCTV cameras on the road in front but police failed to identify any suspect based on the footage. The police tracked down Tapas Das, 25, while pursuing the trail of a stolen cellphone that was sold to a woman at Shyampur in Howrah.Armed with sketchy details about the man who sold the phone to the woman, the police activated their sources and found that the suspect was a frequent visitor to a red-light zone in the Girish Park area of north Calcutta.Das was arrested from the area on Tuesday night. “We have recovered two laptops, cash and gold ornaments from him,” said an officer of the detective department. Some of the items were stolen from Sinthi.The investigators reached the woman who bought the stolen phone by tracking its IMEI number. She apparently told the cops that she had bought the phone from a man.“We got some clues about the man’s looks from the woman. The descriptions matched that of Tapas Dey, whose name figures in the crime records section at Lalbazar. Based on source information, we learned that Dey was in a habit of going to a red-light area in the city. We launched surveillance but learned that he had started visiting another red-light pocket, in the Girish Park area,” the officer said.“We have come to know that Das was involved in four burglaries in the Sinthi area over the past four months.

1816,Tapas Ghosh,Covid: Calcutta High Court relief for three NEET candidates with medical history - Telegraph India,"A Covid survivor who has to travel all the way to Kharagpur to write his National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) had moved the high court asking what if the authorities did not allow him to write the paper because of his medical history.The court on Wednesday directed the state to ask the examination-conducting agency to make arrangements so that Saumik Jana could write the test alone in a room.Jana is from a village in Murshidabad district.Moving a petition before Justice Tapabrata Chakraborty, Jana said he was not opposed to going to Kharagpur for the test, but wondered what he would do if the authorities there did not allow him to take the exam because he had recently recovered from Covid-19.All medical colleges in India admit students to their undergraduate courses through NEET.Jana was sent to a quarantine centre for 14 days after he was diagnosed with the disease on August 18.The counsel appearing for him said: “My client was declared Covid-free on September 2. According to health norms, he should be in home quarantine for 14 more days. The NEET authorities at the examination centre could say my client would not be allowed to sit the exam.”The order to the state came following the submission.The high court is swamped with appeals from NEET candidates, especially because the entrance test is preceded by two days of complete lockdown in the state. The court will hear many of the appeals on Thursday.In another case before the same bench on Wednesday, Anindita Jana from East Midnapore said her test centre was in West Midnapore, nearly 150km from her home. Anindita’s counsel wondered how his client would reach the centre as the state would be under lockdown on September 11 and 12 and train services were yet to resume.Justice Chakraborty directed the state government to arrange for a vehicle for Anindita so she could reach the venue.Jayatri Pal, from Raiganj in South Dinajpur, expressed the same worry because her test venue was about 155km from her home.Jayatri had moved the plea before Justice Arindam Sinha.

1817,Kinsuk Basu,"Kolkata bus, minibus forum to seek PM’s help - Telegraph India","A forum of private bus and minibus operators in Calcutta has decided to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding the Centre ensures diesel price drops and offer them financial relief.The price of diesel was Rs 76.66 a litre in Calcutta on Wednesday. In June it was Rs 65.62 a litre. The impact has been felt across the board with prices of vegetables and other items soaring.Bus and minibus operators said they had been hit the worst. Fuel comprises almost 60 per cent of the expenditure and the escalating diesel price has left them in the lurch, many said. The state government has refused to revise the existing fares and many have defaulted on their vehicle EMI payments.“There has been a drop in ticket sales by almost 60 per cent. So what will a bus owner earn to pay his EMIs? State can run buses on subsidy. But we can’t,” Tapan Bandyopadhayay of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said. “The Centre must intervene. We want a waiver on insurance premium and a temporary waiver of EMIs so that those with vehicle loans are not blacklisted.”At a meeting of bus and minibus owners and operators on Wednesday, representatives of various unions decided that apart from writing to Modi, they would make similar appeals to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and transport minister Nitin Gadkari.“Why won’t we be considered a part of the small or micro industry? Why can’t the Centre give us some sops?” Swapan Ghosh, the joint secretary of the Minibus Operators Coordination Committee, asked.",2020-10-09 03:03:00

1819,Snehal Sengupta,Scores of injured birds at Salt Lake rescue centre - Telegraph India,"Kite strings are proving to be risky not only for two-wheeler riders but also for birds who are getting injured after getting entangled in them.Once they get entangled, they struggle to free themselves and in the process injure their wings, legs or talons. Some even die.Scores of birds, including black kites, owls, pigeons and kingfishers, were injured by kite strings in the past couple of days. Many Calcuttans as well as forest department officials have rescued innumerable injured birds, an official at the forest department’s Wildlife Rescue Centre in Salt Lake said.Close to 50 birds have been rescued and the rescue centre has released many after they recovered from their injuries, the official said.The centre has been receiving calls from across the city. People call up to say they spotted injured birds entangled in kite strings or struggling on the ground.Many have taken to flying kites in the city during the lockdown.Several two-wheeler riders on flyovers have been critically injured by kite strings. Some have died of injuries.Manja (a mixture of glass and glue) helps kites soar but also adds to the string’s sharpness. Such strings do not snap and leave birds entangled in them severely injured.The nylon ones are known as Chinese manja — they are almost unbreakable and are extremely sharp.“We often hear of such injuries to birds, especially black kites. Birds cannot see the string while flying and they get entangled in them,” Shubhankar Patra, a veteran birdwatcher, said.Black kites, common in the city, are large, slow-flying birds. Being scavengers, they keep hovering in the sky in search of food. Owls, too, cannot spot strings until it is too late.A few days ago, an injured Indian Kite was spotted dangling from the branch of a tree at the Park Street and Camac Street crossing. Passers-by alerted cops. Traffic sergeants Diptimoy Ghosh and Awasim Bari of the South traffic guard climbed on top of a boundary wall adjacent to the tree and rescued the bird.They then alerted the forest department, which sent a rescue team to the area. The bird was taken to the rescue centre in Salt Lake where it was treated.An official at the centre said more than 26 birds with injuries from kite strings had been rescued in the past week. “Most have injuries on their wings or legs… they struggle to free themselves once they get entangled in kite strings. We try our best but many cannot fly after getting slashed or entangled in these strings,” the official said.Forest officials and various NGOs are worried about a spike in the number of injured birds during Vishwakarma Puja, which is round the corner, when sparring with kites is common in the city.Calcutta High Court had in July directed cops to strictly enforce the ban on Chinese manja and nylon and synthetic strings used to fly kites.",2020-10-09 03:19:00

1821,Sanjay Mandal,Rent relief for Kolkata airport outlets - Telegraph India,"The city airport has decided to waive the rent on 100-odd outlets on its premises for April and May, when flights were stalled because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Besides, the Airports Authority of India recently sent a communication to Calcutta airport, saying the rent would be reduced for June, July and August proportionate to the reduced passenger footfall compared with the previous year.Airport officials said they had informed the retail, food and beverage and other agencies about the “concessionaire support scheme”. “Rebate in licence fees will be given to the extent of reduction in passenger footfall from the corresponding period of previous year,” said an airport official. He said no bills would be raised for April and May, when there were no commercial flights.The official said the passenger footfall was almost 70 per cent less in August than what it used to be before the Covid pandemic.The situation improved in September, on the days flights are operating between Calcutta and six cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune and Nagpur.The flights between Calcutta and the six cities had been suspended on July 6 because of a surge in Covid cases there. The services resumed on September 1 and currently flights on the six routes are operating three days a week.There are 54 food and beverage outlets at Calcutta airport’s integrated terminal, of which 33 are operating. Of the 31 retail stores, 21 have reopened after domestic flights resumed in end-May. Airport officials said the retail and F&B stores in the international section were still closed because flights were yet to resume.Metro had in July reported that several agencies, including the stores and the one running parking facilities at the airport, had sought rebates on rents. The city airport used to earn Rs 14 crore a month as licence fee.  Some of the agencies are opposed to calculating the rebate as a proportion of the reduction in passenger footfall.“Now there are more passengers who are not coming on private vehicles. They take buses. So even if the passenger count has gone up compared with June, we are not getting enough business,” said said Babulal Yadav, general manager of Mahesh Sunny Enterprises, which runs the parking facility.But airport officials said passenger footfall could be the only basis of calculation.The Oberoi Group’s flight catering unit, although it does not pay a licence fee to the airport, is looking at resuming business. The unit had written to the Centre earlier, requesting the government to allow serving meals on board. Recently, the civil aviation ministry has given the go-ahead.“We are preparing to serve meals on board from September 13. We are expecting a few orders from airlines,” said an official of the unit.",2020-10-09 23:21:00

1825,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus lockodwn: Mission to feed 100-odd strays in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A 51-year-old woman who lives on Lovelock Street in Ballygunge is feeding more than 100 stray dogs and cats in several pockets of the city during the lockdown.Sandra Hendricks is splitting her time between taking care of her grandmother, looking after 11 rescued dogs at home and cooking for and delivering food to the strays.Hendricks said she would feed around 40 stray dogs in her locality every day before the lockdown had kicked in.After the lockdown was imposed, she realised that hundreds of animals who were earlier looked after by office-goers and street vendors were not getting any food and fighting among themselves for whatever little was available.A former employee of Tata Steel, Hendricks called up two of her friends — Sucheta Sinha, who owns and operates a pet-friendly cab service, and Anuj Sharma, a professional dog walker — to help her out.“Since I don’t have a vehicle, I realised I alone would not be able to pack the food and feed so many animals,” said Hendricks.The three are cooking around 25kg of rice, 25kg of chicken or 200 eggs every day and feeding around 100 strays within a 5-km radius of her house.The combined cost of the food and the cooking gas is coming to a few thousand rupees every day. The trio is also having to pay for fuel to carry the cooked food. “Each day, we complete a circuit of around 7km feeding the animals,” said Hendricks.So far, Hendricks and her friends have been covering their expenses from their pockets and donations from other friends and family members. Now, they are looking for crowdfunding.“We are in need of funds or food items on an immediate basis and so we are considering crowdfunding.... Strangers have landed up in front of my house and left bags of rice and chicken at the doorstep,” said Hendricks, who has started a crowdfunding page on Facebook.",2020-11-04 20:48:00

Some of them are rickshaw-pullers.The school administrator had asked them what they needed the most. The refrain was: “Please give us some potatoes, rice and oil. We can boil the potatoes and use some oil to mash it with and can have it with rice. That will sustain us for long.”Perminder Dasani, the administrator of the school, said: “I dropped a message in the WhatsApp group and within a couple of days, ex-students and friends of the school contributed. We plan to go back to the same homes next week and give them more ration.  What we gave today will only sustain them for a few days with many to feed in most houses.”Three boys from the Interact Club of the school went for the distribution — Bheem Patel, Tony Sharma and Asmit Shaw.",2020-11-04 20:52:00
1827,Anasuya Basu,Coronavirus lockdown: Indian Museum awaits Rs 12.75cr repair - Telegraph India,"A repair project to make mends for a repair job completed at Indian Museum in 2015 has been sanctioned and work will start after the lockdown ends, said the director-in-charge of the institute, Arijit Dutta Choudhury.The Rs 12.75-crore repair project was awarded to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) in March, right before the lockdown had kicked in, Dutta Choudhury said. “It is very unfortunate that repairs and renovation work had to be postponed because of this lockdown. But once it is lifted, the CPWD will start work in full earnest.”The Telegraph had in March last year reported that the 144-year-old museum, which had undergone a Rs 200-crore modernisation and restoration between 2013 and 2015, had chunks of its walls and corners breaking off, water dripping from the roof, vegetation sprouting from nooks and lime plaster coming off.It took almost a year to get the repairs and maintenance work approved. “There has been no routine maintenance of the building. The last time any work happened was during the bicentennial celebrations,” said Dutta Chaudhury.Elaborating on the funds, the director said: “We have awarded the CPWD a Rs 4-crore routine maintenance project for a year. This mainly consists of preventive maintenance measures. The agency made a survey of the building and provided us an estimate. We have made part payment in March.” Apart from that, comprehensive and integrated fire safety measures will be introduced at a cost of Rs 8 crore.A fire audit of the building is still pending, said Dutta Chaudhury. “We have supplied the building plans to West Bengal Fire Services and they will do the audit soon. Meanwhile, CPWD can start laying the groundwork for the fire safety measures such as identifying the spot for the water reservoir and checking fire hydrants. The gas-based fire safety measures can only be undertaken after the audit,” he said. “A sum of Rs 75 lakh has been sanctioned for roof repairs. There are three to four terraces from where water seeps. The terraces will be treated for water seepage. Because of the seepage, a number of galleries on the second floor have been closed to public for a long time,” said Dutta Chaudhury. The museum has been shut for the public since March 16 and the director feels it should not be opened to public right away. “I think now there are more basic needs of people that should be met. Museum visit is not a priority. It would be a very opportune time to repair the museum thoroughly before opening it to the public. If the lockdown is lifted in the Indian Museum area, we could start work immediately,” he said. While people might not be able to visit the museum, it is starting online sessions on cultural heritage titled #storiesoftheworld from April 14 on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.Academics and performers will present short videos on cultural heritage through the museum’s social media handles.",2020-11-04 20:55:00
1828,Our Special Correspondent,"Pay guest teachers, Partha Chatterjee tells colleges - Telegraph India","Education minister Partha Chatterjee on Saturday asked colleges to continue paying salaries to their guest teachers from their coffers.“It has been noticed that several colleges appointed guest teachers. They have stopped paying salaries to these teachers. The colleges should consider paying salaries to the guest teachers like they were doing before,” Chatterjee said.Many colleges have not been paying the guest teachers their remuneration since January because of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s announcement in August last year that the salaries of part-time, contractual and guest teachers of state-aided colleges would be enhanced and the state government would provide the funds to pay them.The minister said the higher education department had started a process of verifying details of about 12,000 part-time contractual and guest teachers before implementing the enhanced salaries.The process of verification has been kept on hold because of the lockdown forced by the novel coronavirus.Chatterjee asked the colleges to clear the dues of the guest teachers in accordance with the old pay structure.A guest teacher used to be paid between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000. In the revised scale, the salary will be Rs 30,000.",2020-11-04 21:02:00
1829,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Jadavpur University  tech students to intern from home - Telegraph India,"Engineering students of Jadavpur University will do their summer internship online because of the lockdown.The aspiring engineers will get a taste of work from home before they get familiar with the real grime on the shop floor.Internships offer students with an opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to real-life situations, said an official of the university’s placement cell.   “It also helps in building a network,” he said.At JU, the third-year students take part in internship programmes that start in the third week of May and continue for four to eight weeks.Is doing internship from home same as hitting the ground?“The students will at least be exposed to some sort of problems that the industry will ask them to solve. This will be partly beneficial, something that we could look for under the circumstances,” said Anupam Basu, the director of NIT Durgapur and a professor of computer science and engineering at IIT Kharagpur.At his institute, Basu, a former student of Jadavpur University, has introduced this model of internship from home in the wake of the lockdown.“In some cases, the company is sending problems to the students. Our teachers, who have worked as consultants with the industry, is giving students assignment to solve,” said Basu.At JU, the eligible candidates go to the companies such as Amazon, Flipkart and PwC for the internship.Asked what could be the structure of internship from home, a senior representative of a company said they were  evolving a model and would soon update the students concerned.“It could be that we would share with the students data of our earlier marketing strategy. The students will be asked to determine what is going to be the forecasting model based on a study of artificial intelligence (AI),” he said.The internship starts after the completion of the sixth-semester exams.“Given the prevalent crisis, the campuses in Bengal would reopen only after June 10. No one knows when the students could start going to the shop floors, which are now shut because of the lockdown. Therefore, we have convinced the companies to start the internship from home,” said Chiranjib Bhattacharjee, a pro-vice-chancellor of JU.The internship is a must because when the engineering students appear in job interview, prospective employers ask whether the candidate has done internship.“As the exam cannot be held till June 10, we thought of keeping the students engaged by letting them attend internship by working from home,” said a university official.Around 70 per cent out of 1,240 students in the engineering faculty participate in the internship.Pro-VC Bhattacharya said the internship would begin on April 27 at the earliest.He said there were certain types of internships that cannot be done by working from home. For those students, the university is thinking of winter internships.“We cannot ask a student who is due to intern at Haldia Petrochemicals or refinery to join the internship from home. For them, visiting the plant is a must. We are planning a winter internship for them,” he said.Another official said the placement drive of about 150-odd fourth-year students could not be completed because of the closure forced by the lockdown.“Around 72 per cent students have got job offers. For the rest, we are planning a special placement drive from July. This depends on response from companies,” the official said.",2020-11-04 21:09:00

A student of Class XII will have to pay Rs 7,500 instead of Rs 15,400.The state government on Friday wrote to private schools asking them not to increase their fees this year and to consider “sympathetically” if guardians were unable to pay fees on time.“South Point School has decided that the fee structure proposed by the school for the ensuing academic year 2020-21 shall presently be held in abeyance. Collection of various components of fee and other charges, including for text and exercise books, uniforms, bus fees, activity and other optional fees etc that are usually collected in the month of April, is also being deferred for the time being till the school reopens,” the school said.The school has also said that the guardians who would not be able to pay the April fee in time because of “economic hardships” will be allowed time at least till May 15 to make the payment.South City International School principal John Bagul wrote to parents on Saturday: “As per the state government request, the fee structure remains the same as last year till further notice. Kindly note that those who paid the new fee structure would be adjusted in the next quarter. No change or increase in fee structure at present.”Before the government’s letter came, National High School had announced some relief for parents on April 3. The school waived 50 per cent of the tuition fee for April. Bhavan’s Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, too, has decided to charge only a portion of the enhanced fee for now.",2020-11-04 21:14:00
1831,Sanjay Mandal,"Coronavirus pandemic: No varsity volunteers, Covid-19 test devices idle - Telegraph India","Several machines that the state government has borrowed from universities and research institutes for Covid-19 tests cannot be put to use because of lack of personnel, officials said on Monday.Health department officials had recently sounded out the institutes for volunteers but no one responded, sources said. Government officials said the fear of getting infected by the novel coronavirus had prompted teachers to avoid going to medical colleges to help install the equipment and train the technicians.Now, the health department is planning to write to these universities and ask them to send experts. “The real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) machines sent by the universities and research institutes are lying unused because of lack of manpower. The number of tests at several testing centres cannot be increased because the universities and research institutes have said they are unable to provide the manpower. The teachers are scared and unwilling to step into medical colleges,” said a health department official. “We have verbally appealed to these institutes but to no effect.” Officials said the number of tests at several medical colleges could have gone up had the machines been used.In Bengal, 47,615 samples were tested till Monday, out of which 4,201 were tested on Monday.The Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital and the Malda Medical College and Hospital are testing fewer than expected samples despite the RT-PCR machines having been supplied to them. “We had asked teachers from the pharmacy department to volunteer for installing and running the RT-PCR machines. But none has agreed to go saying they are scared,” said an official of Jadavpur University. “The teachers told us they could train technicians at the university’s laboratories but would not visit hospitals.”Metro had on April 30 reported that several state-aided universities and research institutes in Bengal gave testing equipment to medical colleges. The RT-PCR machines are used for research that requires experiments involving genes. The technique is useful as it helps obtain accurate results.The urgent need to perform more Covid-19 tests had prompted the state government to ask educational institutes for the equipment. It takes three to four weeks to procure a RT-PCR machine, if imported. Each machine costs about Rs 1 crore.",2020-11-05 20:33:00
1832,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus Lockdown: Nod for app cabs with conditions  - Telegraph India,"The Bengal government has decided to allow app cabs within the jurisdiction of the police commissionerates of Calcutta, Howrah, Bidhannagar and Barrackpore with a set of riders.App cabs will carry only passengers with a government e-pass. The cabs will not be allowed in containment zones, a transport department official said.The date of commencement of services is still to be finalised but app cab aggregators will get the permission within a week, the official said.The department has categorised passengers who can travel in app cabs:“Not more than two persons will be allowed in a cab and they will have to use the rear seat,” the official said. “No one will be allowed to sit beside the driver.”A moveable transparent protective sheet will be placed between the driver and the passenger and particulars of the passenger will have to be made available to the government by the aggregators. Drivers and passengers have to wear masks, gloves and face shields. A driver has have to provide hand sanitiser to a passenger.Several hundreds of app cab drivers hailed the decision but said they would wait for more clear orders from the companies.“It is not clear what happens if a driver turns up and finds the passenger doesn’t have an e-pass. Who will cancel the trip… it is not possible for the driver to find out if the person booking a ride has a pass,” a driver from Hazra, who is on the Ola and Uber platforms, said.The two companies didn’t respond to the government move.  “We had appealed to the chief secretary on Monday to resume app cab services in Calcutta,” Indranil Banerjee, convener of the West Bengal Online Cab Operators Guild, said. “There are certain grey areas that we would like to clear before resuming operations.

1833,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Internet plays class disruptor - Telegraph India,"Poor network connection is keeping students from attending online classes, parents have been complaining.Teachers, too, have been facing problems with broadband or WiFi connections.Schools are struggling with a system that is still evolving and the heads of several institutions said they were yet to resolve basic technical glitches.La Martiniere for Boys had to call off a class because a teacher did not have web connectivity.“Network issues are beyond the control of the school and the class had to be locked because we noticed unauthorised people entering to disturb the class. Let’s understand that there are classes when a child is absent from school and when the teacher has time they try to cover the missed portions,” said John Rafi, principal of La Martiniere for Boys.A teacher of South Point was logged out of class because of poor network and a member of the school’s back-up team had to fill in.“We cannot control internet connectivity. But we have created a back-up so that if a teacher fails to connect, someone else can take his or her place so that the platform is not misused,” said Krishna Damani, trustee of South Point.Some teachers lock the classroom five minutes into the proceedings and if a student gets logged out because of poor network coverage, he or she remains out.“Students can send WhatsApp messages to teachers or request re-entry. But a lot of time gets wasted in the process and with so many interruptions the class loses its rhythm,” said Bobby Baxter, the principal of Julien Day School, Ganganagar.Some schools are also recording the classes for their own archives or for revision, not always sharing it with the students.Teachers in some schools are also sharing audio clips or recordings of the class on a different platform for students.“We have created back-up options so that the content of the class can be shared with the students,” said Anjana Saha, the principal of Mahadevi Birla World Academy.Sushila Birla Girls’ School also has back-up options but the principal admits it is not always the same. “In an interactive class, a child can have a doubt cleared immediately, which is not always the case in recordings,” she said.After feedback regarding network problems, Shri Shikshayatan School is deliberating if data plans can be made available to teachers from a single company to minimise the problem.Most schools agreed that the problems could not be resolved overnight, rather changes and modifications would have to be made over a period of time.",2020-11-05 20:54:00
1834,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus Lockdown: Business slump tells on charity - Telegraph India,"The unprecedented slump in business is drying up donations to charitable organisations that have been providing free food to the poor and the hungry in and around the city.Fresh funds are dwindling and these NGOs are realising with each passing day that without aggressive government support, they have to scale down the distribution or stop it altogether.An association of Calcutta-based restaurant owners has provided over seven lakh meals during the lockdown, coordinating with police and NGOs for distribution. The group had been providing meals to around 25,000 people every day till a week ago. The number has now come down to less than 15,000.“We will not continue the distribution beyond May 15 because we don’t have money,” said Sagar Daryani, the co-founder of Wow! Momo, who heads the Calcutta chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India.“My business is one-tenth of what it used to be. But I am having to spend around Rs 4 crore every month in paying salaries,” he said.There was no dearth of funds from individual and corporate donors and associations in the first phase of the lockdown. But few donors had anticipated it would turn out to be such a long-drawn affair. The lockdown completed 47 days on Monday. The funds started choking when the donors realised their earnings had also taken a massive hit.“When a cyclone hits the Sunderbans, I am not directly affected. I can contribute what I want to the relief and rehabilitation. But the Covid-19 shutdown has crippled my earnings,” said a city-based businessman, who is associated with a string of NGOs. The effect is being felt on the ground. Gurdwara Behala has provided free meals to thousands of people over the past few weeks. But the going has now got tough, even with several benevolent individuals in its fold.“Our resources have been stretched to the extreme. We are now finding it increasingly difficult to continue the drive,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, the chairperson of the IHA Foundation and general secretary of Gurdwara Behala. The association has provided close to five lakh meals, most of them through langars (through community kitchens).With pay and job cuts, the salaried donors have also not been insulated from the crisis, making fund mobilisation a Herculean task.“Eighty per cent of the money we have spent till date on food and other essential items was collected in 20 per cent of the time, that is the first few days of the lockdown. Collection of the remaining 20 per cent took up 80 per cent of the time,” said Mudar Patherya, one of trustees of the Kolkata Gives Foundation, an umbrella organisation of over 30 NGOs. After having provided close to 20 lakh meals during the lockdown, the organisers are finding it difficult to continue the drive.Almost everyone Metro spoke to said that without government subsidy and support, helping the needy — who have a long way before getting back to normal working ways — would be impossible in the future.A businessman who is actively involved in free distribution camps was recently part of a webinar with a central minister. “We have sufficient stock of food grains for three years,” he quoted the minister as having said.“If that is the case, the government should step forward and help us with subsidies while procuring stuff for distribution. When we started the distribution, we bought rice from the wholesale market at Rs 22 a kilo. It has now gone up to Rs 27-28. Similarly, the price of pulses has gone up to Rs 68 from Rs 60. We are not getting any subsidised rates,” the businessman told this newspaper.Not that there is no exception.The community kitchens being run by present and former students of Jadavpur University and Presidency University have bucked the trend and grown in size.The vast pool of former students is the driving force behind the growth, said insiders. “Today, a person from the batch of 85 donates a decent amount. Tomorrow, another former student takes the cue and donates more,” said an organiser of the Jadavpur University kitchen.Past and present teachers, whose earnings have been insulated from the slump, are among regular contributors.Additional reporting by Subhankar Chowdhury",2020-11-05 21:01:00
1835,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Kolkata doctor's appeal to juniors - Telegraph India,"A 61-year-old government doctor has written to his junior colleagues urging them to shed their misplaced fears and “self-concern” and work at a time when “humanity is facing a crisis”.Abhijit Chowdhury, in the forefront of Bengal’s Covid-19 management team, has urged his colleagues not to treat the mail it as a “sermon from a patriarch” but “an appeal from a volunteer and a scientific activist”, who is “troubled, pained, anguished and perturbed” seeing them “getting downed in unscientific fear, myths and utterly unfounded self-concern at an hour of crisis for humanity”.Chowdhury is the professor and head of the department of hepatology in the School of Digestive and Liver Diseases at the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research, SSKM Hospital.Metro obtained contents of the email from SSKM sources. The sources said Chowdhury wrote the mail on Monday, after several PhD fellows of the department stayed away from the hospital saying they or their family members were unwell.The mail, which had a copy marked to the director of the institute, mentioned how some doctors were not attending patients on the pretext of age.“Age (I am 61 and am jumping around in a frenzy of madness), family troubles, difficulty in transportation, personal illness are excuses that are being put by some while a large chunk of our students are already at work. I would request the frightened and lame excuse-savvy lot to come out of their shells and join immediately,” Chowdhury wrote.He is also part of the medical task force set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee to fight Covid-19 in Bengal.Chowdhury confirmed to this newspaper that he had sent the mail and added: “It is for internal circulation.” The Telegraph reported on Monday how a section of doctors attached to private hospitals and clinics in Calcutta was not seeing patients for fear of infection. Hospital officials said many doctors had switched off their phones and patients and hospitals were unable to reach them.Chowdhury’s mail revealed that the problem exists in government hospitals, too. “Do not consider this as an imposition of draconian rule but a request to behave with sanity and semblance of responsibility at a time when you are required. Let me tell you that many ornamented loud-mouthed people decorated as scientists are behaving exactly similar to what some of you are doing in being wary of avoiding responsibility,” the mail said. “Scientists all over the world and our country, except unfortunately those in some big institutes in this state, are putting up a brilliant participatory endeavour at this moment.” “As students of science, you may kindly be driven by truth and fact, rather than by fear and myth,” the mail added.  Chowdhury appealed to the medical students to keep the diagnostic facility of SSKM running. “We will need your service for running the diagnostic facility at SSKM Hospital. You are capable, trained, have derived lots of benefits (I mention — this was your right, nobody gifted you this) and now it is a responsibility to deliver and shun your hide and seek attitude (if at all you have)...,” the mail stated. Chowdhury reminded his colleagues that “Covid infection and death are not synonymous.” He wrote that only 3 per cent of the infected are critical. The veteran doctor also pointed out in his mail that personal protective equipment would be given to all doctors.“Let me tell you that healthcare workers who have been infected so far are mostly those who were caught unawares. As you know, confused, frightened, fleeing soldiers fall in battlefields — not the valiant, protected fighters,” the mail stated.  SSKM sources said a number of doctors promised to return to work after getting the mail.Health department officials admitted that they were facing problems of doctors, including junior doctors, expressing their unwillingness to resume work. At many government-run medical colleges, doctors have staged protests over lack of personal protective gear.They said that in other countries, such as the US, doctors from areas not much affected by Covid-19 were volunteering for hospitals in affected areas.Doctors from all streams, including cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology and general surgery are being trained in Covid-19 treatment protocol and treating coronavirus patients in the US after their colleagues are getting infected.",2020-11-05 21:12:00

1839,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus Lockdown room for bridge tests in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The Tollygunge- Karunamoyee bridge was closed to traffic on Monday for conducting a load test.The bridge will remain closed till 6am on Thursday, police and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) officials said. Making most of the empty roads and thin traffic during the lockdown, the CMDA has decided to conduct load tests of several elevated corridors in the city, which have been pending for long.The load tests are being conducted as part of an overall health audit of the structures. Chetla bridge, which connects the Rashbehari crossing and Chetla, will remain closed to traffic for three days from Friday, a CMDA official said.Chitpore bridge that runs between BT Road and Bagbazar will be shut down soon to assess the condition of the bridge’s pavement. The bridge has been retrofitted to extend its life by another five years, said a CMDA official. “We are trying to conduct  load tests of as many bridges and flyovers as possible during the lockdown since the traffic load is low. Even if the lockdown is lifted after May 17, all sectors are unlikely to be opened at one go. So traffic will still remain less. We will try and carry on with load tests of the remaining structures even then,” a CMDA official said. The state urban development department started a health study of several elevated corridors in the city after the collapse of the Majerhat bridge in September 2018. The completion of the Majerhat bridge is, however,  set to be delayed. “We had targeted an early September completion, but that target will be missed. We could begin our work only after April 20 when the government gave special permission to continue the project. But getting workers and materials is proving to be difficult,” said the PWD official.The demolition of Tallah bridge has continued through the lockdown.",2020-11-05 22:25:00
1840,Brinda Sarkar,"Lockdown blues: Confinement is playing on the minds of residents, young and old in Salt Lake - Telegraph India","Sutapa Majumdar began learning music at the age of three. She loved it so much that for the next 71 years, not a day went by without her singing. She pursued music as a subject, became a radio artiste, became a music teacher and her latest assignment was teaching at New Town’s Swapno Bhor senior citizens’ park. Along came the lockdown and her world changed.“For the last three months, I haven’t hummed a single line. My spirit is lost and voice choked,” says the 74-year-old miserably. “My students are sending me recordings of their songs and asking me to correct them but for the first time in my life I can’t get myself to listen to music. I’m stagnating within four walls.”The lockdown has affected residents in various ways. Some have learnt cooking, some are busy working from home and some have become extremely lonely. The house arrest has taken a toll on residents who feel deprived of the face-to-face company of friends and family.Life at a standstillMajumdar is so upset at not being able to hold her music classes that it has made her lethargic. “I haven’t taken a single sari out of the closet since the lockdown. Even if I force myself to go for a walk once in a while I just don a housecoat over my nightie. Halfway through the walk, I remember that I haven’t even combed my hair,” says the resident of Sunrise Point. “Nothing matters anymore.”Sukumar Chakraborty of Labony says he can see depression all around. “The holiday mood is over and residents are now consumed by worry. Will they get paid their salaries next month? Will their loved ones contract Covid? They are getting irritable and youths are storming out of the house without caring about infection…”He speaks of a neighbour suffering from dizzy spells, loss of appetite and mood swings. “The doctor has visited her several times and said she is fine but the lady, who lives alone, insists otherwise. I think she’s just lonely.”The early lockdown days were difficult for Tapas Guha of EE Block as he was bereaved. “We are a close-knit family and have 300 people coming over for our Kali puja every year. But since no one was allowed to travel during the lockdown we couldn’t even mourn the loss of my brother collectively.” Guha has since taken solace, discovered the many facets of his terrace, recognised the writing abilities of his daughter and is playing with his four-month-old grandson.Aryama Sen, a student of Jadavpur University, says many of her friends are stuck — not at home but — in their rooms. “Not everyone is close to their family members so they are withdrawing to their shells. Even if they had an impetus to study in the initial days of the lockdown, most students have given up now and are binging on books or Netflix.”  Excuse to head outUnable to stay home any longer, some people are conjuring excuses to step out. “An acquaintance of mine — a bank manager in Ultadanga — has many elderly people come to their branch daily to deposit sums like Rs 200 and 300. Upon asking, the visitors confess that the bank is the only place they have to go and so they go over to deposit nominal sums daily,” says Rupa Ghosh of AB Block. “The vendors at AB-AC Market, too, say residents who used to come weekly are now going daily, and in some cases up to five times a day!”The other day Isha Dasgupta’s family visited the tea stall outside their Sraboni Abason home after months. “The tea was watery and tasteless but it felt so good. We felt like prisoners out on parole and were enjoying every moment of it,” she says.BB Block physician Adrija Rahman Mukherjee says that 20 per cent of patients who could have been treated over phone are insisting they come to the clinic just so they can get out of the house. Some youths confess that they sneaked out to friends’ houses occasionally throughout the lockdown.“I know youths who loitered the streets, and when caught by the police, claimed they were out to buy medicines. Some jumped from roof to roof to escape the police and go buy cigarettes,” says Arunabha Hazra of CD Block. “I even know people who decided to feed the needy as they would get to meet friends while they were at it. Their escapades end when the money they had raised finished but they began afresh after the cyclone.”Santanu Mitra says his elderly father has been driving off for a spin, off and on. “We are asking him not to, but can understand his helplessness,” says the BF Block resident who lost his mother weeks before the lockdown. “My father needs the support of his friends now but cannot even meet them.”Santanu and wife Deepanwita Datta are trying to come to terms with the bizarre situation themselves. All the more since they are newlyweds whose reception had to be put off due to the lockdown. Far from taking off on their honeymoon, the couple is now tending to office calls while cooking and sweeping.Run to the terraceThose who have access to the terrace are escaping there for some me-time but the option becomes tricky in apartment blocks. “Since residents of all flats in the building are heading upstairs, the terrace is getting crowded in the afternoon,” says Sumona Roy of Baisakhi Abasan, who is now going upstairs at 6am for yoga.“There’s not enough space to workout in the flat now since everyone is home all the time. I need to spread out my towel, water bottle and it’s annoying to have to move out to let someone walk past in the middle of my asana,” Sumona says.Dasgupta’s family heads to the terrace of their Sraboni Abason apartment too but not many others join them there. “People are too scared to come up,” she says. “The few who do come walk at a distance. Then there is a pair of siblings - both young adults - who stroll in the farthest corners of the terrace, presumably speaking to their beaus on the phone. Staying locked up in a flat is leading to a lack of privacy.”Out-of-the-box solutionsSharmila Sengupta of GD Block has no time to be depressed. She has taken in two puppies during the lockdown and is now either trying to stop her Beagle from chewing the doormat or teaching her Golden Retriever new commands, both unsuccessfully.A 10-year-old girl of New Town was so disturbed by all the talk of despair around that she had started asking her parents if they would all die from Covid-19. This prompted a friend of the family to start a games night for children in their friends-and-family circuit. The kids now meet once a week over video call for oral games and activities. They chat, laugh and for a while forget that they are away from one another.Sampita Roy’s younger son — a Class IV student — is part of this kids’ group and she says this is the only online session the boy looks forward to. “Other online classes are too formal and boring,” says Roy. Last week her son made Mango Parfait with the others and ate it together with them. “He liked it so much that he made some again later for us. He’s also been making it for himself to sip during his other online classes. Such activities keep kids occupied productively.”Chakraborty, of Labony, is so moved by the sights and sounds of the lockdown that he has started writing an audio drama series on them. “I am part of a theatre group called Drammar and we are missing our rehearsals terribly. But the next best thing we can do is an audio drama and that’s what’s keeping us busy now,” he says. Has the lockdown mentally affected you or any of your acquaintances in the locality?

1842,Snehal Sengupta,Internet service yet to be restored post-cyclone Amphan - Telegraph India,"Even though it has been more that three weeks since cyclone Amphan struck the city, residents of Salt Lake are waiting for their telecom networks — wired and wireless —to come back to life.Students of the township are missing online classes, professionals are often getting logged unexpectedly out of webinars while patients are missing on online medical consultations across the township.All this while most call centres of cable operators or telecom majors are either not picking up calls or are assuring their customers that “services will be restored in the next 72 hours”.BE Block resident Avishek Ranjan Bera, who is pursuing a PhD in bioinformatics, said there was no internet connection in his house.“I am a Hathaway subscriber and have been without broadband connection since the cyclone struck. I am not being able to download my papers and access server-based tools for my research,” said Bera, adding that multiple calls to the service provider’s helpline went unanswered.  Utpal Sinha of AJ Block has had no internet since the cyclone struck a full three weeks ago. “I am a teacher and it’s very difficult to conduct online classes without stable internet. I’ve been doing them without video for three weeks now as too much data is getting consumed,” he says.After repeated queries, Hathway, Sinha’s internet service provider, informed him that they would take “some more time” to restore connection. “As compensation they are offering to extend the duration of my contract with them but I don’t care for that. I need service now. I would have quit anyway if I hadn’t already paid for a year’s connection. My friends who were on quarterly contract have quit after Amphan. Another friend was forced to buy a dongle. My son lives in Spain and it’s frustrating to not be able to hold decent video calls with him at such a difficult time. I can’t believe we’re going through such problems in the 21st century.”Most cable operators The Telegraph spoke to listed out a plethora of problems for the delay in restoration of services.A senior Airtel official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that as they were not informed of tree-cutting and removal undertaken by various agencies, optical fibre cables got accidentally snapped. This spelt a virtual blackout for Salt Lake homes.Sujoy Saha, a representative of the Cable TV and Broadband Operators’ Association, who also gives out Hathway and Alliance Broadband internet connections, said replacing snapped cables had emerged as a financial burden. Several operators were looking to reduce costs and this was also hampering restoration of service.According to Saha, the overhead cable cost, including installation charges, comes around Rs 20-25 per metre, depending on the quality of the cable. “These are our own expenses and we don’t get any support from banks and financial institutions,” said Saha, adding that cash management had become a challenge post-cyclone.“We have never seen such damage. Thousands of trees have fallen, causing major fibre cuts. We are trying to restore services as fast as we can,” said Saha.In addition to this he also pointed out that they had taken some time as most technicians had gone home due to the lockdown. According to him, they had to send in cars to places as far as Serampore in Hooghly to transport them and are having to arrange for their stay.A BSNL official said cable replacement was both labour intensive and time-taking, According to the official, it takes a skilled technician to figure out where the fault is and then restore connection. According to the official, many operators had tried to do patchwork repairs but they did not work.Another local cable operator, who gives cable and internet connections in Salt Lake and Kankurgachhi, said that mounting costs and demand for increased wages by technicians had burnt a hole in their pocket.  According to Shyamal Sarkar, the cable operator, the markets where optic fibre cables can be purchased were shut.“There is a shortage of cable as the market was closed because of the lockdown. Shops and godowns were closed, and cable and equipment were inaccessible despite being in stock. This has caused the delay. Some stockists are charging extra for the cables as well,” said Sarkar while adding that  a drum of optic fibre cable is now selling for nearly Rs 3500, up by nearly Rs 600 as compared to earlier market rates. ",2020-11-06 12:11:00
1843,A Staff Reporter,"Drive in for meal by the lake: Cafe Ajante, lockdown - Telegraph India","Craving restaurant food but still unsure about dining out? Why not drive in and dine in the comfort of your own car? Eco Park has revamped the eatery next to its Eiffel Tower replica and now offers delicious food in the backdrop of a magnificent scenery, all in the isolation of your car.“This restaurant was christened Café Ajante by the chief minister but in the post-lockdown scenario we have replaced the word café with dhaba,” said Debashis Sen, chairman cum managing director of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), that is in charge of Eco Park. “While it has indoor seating facilities with Covid-protective gear like adjustable glass partition, the USP of Dhaba Ajante is the outdoors.”So expect rustic-themed decor with typical lighting, colours and even khatias where one can sit and eat. “The khatias will be installed presently as the artisan who makes them is stuck in the Sundarbans because of the lockdown,” explained Sen.But guests can also park their car opposite the dhaba and dine inside the car or outside, using the bonnet or boot as a table. “Since the water body behind looks beautiful, people may want to step out of the car and eat and we are allowing that,” said Sen, adding that parking fee would not be charged from diners.The dhaba was officially opened on June 8, in the presence of driving enthusiasts like Samaresh Das of New Town’s CD Block, who has driven across continents and members of Kolkata on Wheels, a motoring forum.“We like to promote new activities for our members and this drive-in concept seems like a great idea,” said Souvik Ghosh of Kolkata on Wheels.Rupa Roy, a resident of Salt Lake’s DB Block, said she had a fantastic time dining at the dhaba. “I was yearning to break out of the house and this came as a great option,” said the lady eating Tandoori Chicken in the front passenger seat of her car. The steering wheel was obstructing her husband so he moved behind to eat his dinner. “It was quite comfortable eating in the car,” she said.  The new menu includes dishes like Chicken Reshmi Masala (Rs 336), Paneer Dhania Masala (Rs 252) and Mutton Rogan Josh (Rs 368). Do give the Andey ka Halwa (Rs 173) a try. “This is a northwest frontier cuisine dish where egg is slow cooked along with mawa, ghee, sugar and nuts to get a delectable dessert,” said Snehasis Sinha, additional general manager, tourism, Hidco.Dhaba Ajante is open from 1pm to 9pm. The other Hidco-run eateries — Cafe Ekante in the Eco Park island, New Town Business Club and Biswa Bangla Gate have all opened. Their weekly day off is Monday.",2020-11-06 12:11:00
1845,The Telegraph,Coronavirus lockdown diaries: Salt Lake residents share how they are spending time indoors - Telegraph India,"Debraj SenguptaFE BlockI am listening to songs like songs like Jokhon tumi badha chile tar and We shall overcome to relive my mental agony of the Covid-19 crisis. I am singing them too. These songs have a morale boosting effect when one is despondent or crestfallen.Anup JainCJ BlockI am having the experience of a lifetime, staying home and looking after my family.  I had the privilege of watching and helping my daughter and mother painting old t-shirts and dresses, coming up with amazing new designs and renewing their utility. We are baking cakes and dishes with leftovers. We are joining special quizzes and games on social media.It has brought family members close, making us do household chores, eat and chat together. It is bonding neighbours, where youngsters are helping the elderly.We also contributed to the Jain Purvanchal Terapanth Yuvak Parishad, which is disturbing food and medicine to the needy.  I have been following only government websites for updates instead of believing and spreading social media forwards.The lockdown is a fight of, for and by humanity. We people are staying homes but the real heroes are those working outside. The grocers and home delivery people, chemist, garbage collectors, fruit and vegetable grower and sellers, the police, health workers and researches NGO etc are risking their lives to serve and protect us.Dayita ChakrabortyMillenium TowerGoing to bed early and getting up after 10 o'clock has become a daily routine. Mom has taken out her recipe book and started experimenting with new dishes (they're all plate-licking good!)It has been long since I last read comics or mystery books but now, with the AC on, I lie on my bed and read Tintin or The Adventures of Feluda. I've regained my passion for writing stories and am working on a horror-crime-fiction called No. 13.Our locality is now calm and quiet and we can hear the chirping of so many varieties of birds from dawn till dusk! These days may be boring but they're definitely musical! But I feel bad for Keltu, a timid street dog I would previously offer biscuits and bread to. Wonder if he manages food now.Should a vegetable-vendor be spotted outside, everyone is dashing to him like they'll find the last of Willy Wonka's golden tickets with him!Earlier dad would return home by 8pm but these days at his computer and answering calls for 24 hours a day.What really annoys me is that the domestic helps are sleeping at home and we are paying them! These are really weird days.Meenakshi NathaniBaguihatiI have been trying to workout and eat healthy but its hard that when you are free, have a filled kitchen to yourself and a Netflix account. Sometimes I just want to lie down and do anything but I know that the pain of regret is more than the pain of discipline and if I waste my days, I will regret it.So I'm brushing up on my creative writing skills, painting and cooking new items. I've started a journal so that when I read it 10 years later I have something to laugh at. This is the best time to spend with family. I mean, isn't this we all wanted? A break?I know it's hard to do all this when the future is so uncertain but talk to your friends and you'll realize that everyone is on the same boat. These days when I wake up (late, typically), I realize that the Covid crisis is not a dream and that I am indeed living in a pandemic along with the whole world.But when I take a walk on the terrace I feel close to everyone. All the terraces are full of people wishing for a better future.Sharmistha DharAC BlockEver since the lockdown, it has occurred to me more than ever that there is not a single day to be lost. Being a teacher, the first thing I did was contact my students - who to me are my world - and convey that classes must go on, come hell or high water.I am now fine-tuning lecture notes and study materials and uploading them on the WhatsApp group with my students. After finishing the work from home schedule,  I unwind by forging my long lost bond with nature, something that has got a new lease of life for the first time in this century!I feed a waif neighbourhood kitten, watch it play and observe and note down names of different species of birds flying into my backyard. Instead of bogging me down, the lockdown has taught me to unlock new avenues of learning and happiness.Animesh Ranjan DasBaguiatiPreviously I used to take out time for family activities from my busy work schedule but now due to the lockdown, the tables have turned. Now I am giving more time to my family and taking out pockets to complete office work.My five-year-old daughter would always complain that I neither spend time with her nor play with her. My wife had the same grouse. She said I never sat to help our daughter with her studies.But now, as I am spending all day and night at home, I'm getting the opportunity to spend time lots of quality time with herSandip SenguptaVidyasagar NiketanI have not witnessed World War II myself but have heard a lot about it from my parents. Going by what I see around me now, I am sure the Covid-19 crisis is a replica of the war.Since I am a senior citizen, and thus more susceptible to risk than others, I have totally confined myself at home. I am keeping myself busy by doing routine household tasks daily. I start the day by making breakfast for me and my Mrs, who generally takes care of shopping for essentials nowadays along with cooking and managing other household chores.Post-breakfast, I do some dusting and help with other indoor activities like washing utensils etc. Just before lunch and dinner, I heat food and try to arrange the table. Since I am generally involved in work that requires me to go outdoors on normal days, the lockdown has surely made me realize how challenging and underrated regular household chores are. Hats off to my wife and all homemakers!During afternoons, I scan through The Telegraph in detail and keep myself abreast with all the latest Covid-19-related news and happenings all over the world. Although, for the sake of my mental well-being, I make it a point not to watch too much TV 'breaking news'!I also try to do some freehand exercise and asanas during early evening on our apartment terrace to keep myself physically fit. If I get time, I listen to music on my CD player and on TV, and connect with my friends and family over phone.My main objective during this lockdown period is to chronicle my daily life and thoughts in a diary, which I plan to give to my grand-daughter, Raisa, later. Since she is less than a year old now, I can't explain the world situation to her right away. Maybe when she grows up, she will read the diary and be able to get a glimpse of it. The diary should also be able to make her understand the value of responsibility, positivity, and co-operation in times of crisis.  Srijita TalukdarHalf of my days are spent attending online classes, and completing and mailing assignments.  But after that I'm doing quite a lot.  Reading a good book is bliss and I've just read Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby, The Fault in Our Stars, The Kite Runner and I am now reading Chander Pahar by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay.After a long time I also have time to paint. Not that I'm great at it but painting helps me de-stress. I finished watching Operation MBBS and Little Things (Season 3) and am now streaming the web series Kota Factory and the crime series Breathe.I am hooked to DIY (do it yourself) craft videos on YouTube and thanks to them have painted almost all my 'mason jar' drinking glasses with various colourful designs. I also made a few scrap wood frames and room decors. The life hack videos have also taught me to turn my old clothes into cool outfits!Though I have to study till late night, I get up early to meditate. This keeps me calm and relaxed the whole day. I am also following online exercise classes, doing squats, side planks and zumba.My mother and I have been experimenting with new cake recipes, such as red velvet cake, which was delicious! Baking is our new found love. I am also pursuing advance French classes online and am writing a horror story for my school magazine.Ashmidyuti BhattacharyaBE Block Being in Class VII, I barely knew the meaning of words like lockdown and isolation before this. But now, not only have I understood the meanings, but also learnt that we can live without fast food, without going out and by staying in contact with our extended family virtually.Now I am playing cricket for two hours almost every day, practicing my batting, bowling and even fielding. This I could not do if school was on. I can also do gardening, again something I may never get time for when regular school is on. Previously I would get so much homework and external studies that I would get to play the synthesizer once in a blue moon. Now I am so happy playing it!I sky-watching at night as the sky is so clear and the surrounding hushed, I am pursuing photography as there are many new kinds of birds which I had never seen around before. I am even getting to play games such as ludo and carrom with my family, when previously I could not even talk to them!Before the lockdown I had a chock-a-block schedule but strangely it is now that I'm doing more work. Still I am mystified as to whether my prior life was better or this one, as now I cannot meet my friends. On the other hand previously I could not spend time with family,  something I'm enjoying now.    Rakshak KapoorDakshin Dhari RoadNamo Namah! That's 'namaste' in Sanskrit and by my greetings you can make out what have been learning during the lockdown.The Covid crisis has made us cry but has also made us creative. I for one have have become a master at cooking and an intermediate in Sanskrit.Despite being in Class 12, I now have a lot of time to learn this language. I'm also teaching it to my relatives in other cities through video chatting and they are taking it seriously. Now I can call myself a teacher.My cooking skills have made me the 'Master Chef' of my house and so I'm making lunch for my family. There have been challenges in cooking but I have now learnt things like how not to mistakenly add powdered sugar into a dish assuming it to be salt!I am also writing a book called The Current Education System (of India) for which I'm using about five languages. Above all, the lockdown has made me a multi-tasker.Swechcha Dhara DasguptaSraboni Abason, FC BlockThis too shall pass. It is perhaps clutching these words to heart that people all over the world are passing through the days fraught with the fear of Covid-19. I am no exception.Through the onslaught of online classes and panicking about buying essentials, we are all overwhelmed by loneliness and the fear of the uncertain. To help myself overcome these I have begun a social media initiative to bring everyone together. The initiative, run in Bengali so as to reach out to the masses, is called Ghorbondir Dinjapon (Living amidst a lockdown).Every day I share my mother's poetry, written for these fearful times, along with a recipe or art video emphasizing on the values of zero wastage and conservation of resources. People watching the posts send me their own writings or recipes which I compile to share.Maybe this is a tiny attempt but in these times of fear and divisiveness, this is the manifestation of my wish to keep everyone together and to remind and remember that it is darkest before dawn.Bhawna ShahResident of: Vedic VillageI am spending my time by feeding the hungry. The first thing that came to mind when the lockdown started was stray dogs who used to depend on food from passersby. Who would care for them now? Since we have a Saint Bernard and German Shepherd Dog at home, we felt even more for the street dogs.So I have started serving lunch and dinner to 20 to 25 stray dogs and puppies. The trust, love and satisfaction earned from dogs cannot be bought with money. Just seeing them healthy and playful gives me immense happiness. They have become a part of any activity I do outdoors.Creativity-wise, I tried the #newspaperdress challenge (where one had to make an outfit out of old newspapers). My dress was much appreciated on social media. I also tried the #PillowChallenge (where one uses a belt to wear a pillow in front of them like a dress).I am trying out new dishes and fitness regimes. Though the reason of the lockdown is not a happy one, we have to stay involved in various activities to stay positive and stress-free.The prime focus of this lockdown is strengthening the lost bonding among family members.Sourish BanerjeeResident of: Shapoorji Pallonji, New TownMy joy knew no bounds when I heard that my school will be closed for few extra days! But as the days passed, I started feeling bored and lonely. Now I’m waiting for the lockdown to be lifted.Anyhow, this is allowing me to pursue a variety of new activities. My school (I’m in Class VII) is conducting online classes everyday on Google Meet. It is also sending us e-books to read and I’ve already read Great Expectations and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.I heard from my uncle that bored people are now-a-days counting the holes in Marie Biscuits! I too have tried counting the holes in Cream Cracker biscuit and had great fun.These days I wake up a little late in the morning, do yoga and eat breakfast. I live in a crowded area but these days it is calm and quiet. I see the police standing on duty to enforce the lockdown. Only a few shops are open.As I learn singing, I am able to learn many songs now. I am also clicking photographs of rare birds and the trees from the terrace. I am also able to spend time with my parents.Our school celebrated Rabindrajayanti online but I am still missing the school experience very much. Nonetheless I pray to my Gurudev, Shree Shree Ma Anandamayee for the welfare of India and the world. Jai Hind!Raka ChaudhuriResident of: AD BlockNapoleon had said that every adversity brings with it a seed of equal or greater opportunity. I believe that the joy of creating music and being able to enjoy music every day takes away much of the negativity and drudgery of our lives now.I am a member of a music group called Abhog, Bidhannagar and this group is, in its own way, helping me cope with the abrupt change in lifestyle.Every evening, a member from the group is asked to choose a specific word, topic or genre. Each member is then asked to sing a song based on the word or topic and post it in the group’s chat room. Not just singers, instrumentalists are also contributing with their notes on the violin. Members residing abroad are participating too, and at the end of each day, there is a collection of nearly 20 songs for the members to listen to, discuss among themselves and enjoy.It is helping us stay positive and use the lockdown time in pursuit of creativity and skill development.Shampa DasResident of: CA BlockThe sudden standstill, the deafening silence all around, the confinement, overload of household chores were initially overwhelming. But as the days passed, I started enjoying the cool breeze, chirping of birds, fragrance of summer blooms and the changing colours of the beautiful skies. I realised that now is the time to stand and stare and do all that the heart ever wanted but couldn’t in our otherwise busy lives.While we stand apart in solidarity in the war against the invisible enemy, this time of our lives is getting etched in the pages of history. It motivates me to see how we are being able to live with limited means, spending quality time with parents, catching up with friends and kin virtually, trying new recipes with Ma or enjoying “me time”!I talk to our plants these days — love them, caress them; to my pleasant surprise, they smile back with lovely growth and blooms.It amazes me to see how patient I have become, standing masked in long queues at the kirana stores or even when online deliveries are extremely delayed.Being a laughter yoga trainer and a happiness coach, I am conducting sessions for various corporates and am blessed to see them distressed in these critical hours.When I sit for tea after my yoga practice, I love the calmness inside and out, with only the sound of cool breeze blowing. Perhaps I wouldn’t have been able to experience these priceless moments if not for the lockdown.Though I feel tired after chores and office work, I am amazed at the peace and happiness I feel at bedtime — a sense of gratitude that I am home and being able to care for my elderly parents.Sushil ChopraResident of: BJ BlockAttending daily webinars, practising yoga, meditation, reading spiritual books and watching the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata on Doordarshan have become part of my routine.My wife Sarita and daughter-in-law Pooja are cooking new dishes to satisfy the family’s appetite. Even I have tried my hand at learning the art of dough-preparation for pizzas, chapatis and bread.The biggest challenge after this pandemic will be rebuilding society’s confidence and entering work life safely. I am used to travelling extensively and enjoyed my journeys, whether for business or leisure. This is something I am missing a lot in these social distancing days. Another challenge will be to not lose control when we all come out of this confinement. The industries will have to ensure safety of workers. There will be a new “normal”.Hopefully this phase will make us stronger and better as people.",2020-11-06 12:59:00

Since his hands tremble somewhat he now dictates while others write for him. “Some friends come to seek his advice on pension-related matters and he does their calculations mentally,” says Mita.While Chatterjee is mobile around the house, he leaves home only thrice a year — on Independence Day, Republic Day and Netaji’s birth anniversary. “I’m a good orator and deliver speeches on these days at the block’s programmes,” he says.Poetry on birthdayOn his birthday, Chatterjee was greeted by a few members of the PWD family, the B.E. College alumni group and Gaabesu (Global Alumni Association of Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Shibpur).“Many well-wishers wanted to go over but we had to keep in mind social distancing norms,” says Syama Prasad Datta, a resident of FD Block who is also associated with all the three institutions. “Mihirda had asked for books by Taslima Nasrin or Bimal Mitra. Given the lockdown, we got what we could. On our request, he also recited a portion of Meghnad Bodh Kabya; from memory, of course.”Chatterjee has a command over Bengali, English and Sanskrit and Datta recalls how he would deliver extempore speeches at all their events. “He loves the theatre too and has acted and directed many in the past,” says Datta.A lakh a yearOf all his virtues, Chatterjee says his greatest is his honesty. “I had much scope of being dishonest but I didn’t take that road. My wife Mira had a big role to play in this. She would threaten to desert me if I ever accepted a bribe. That I have been honest shows in my lifestyle,” he says looking around his house. “Who else in Salt Lake has a house that’s only one-storey?”From his honesty stems his generosity. Chatterjee dresses in fotua-dhoti-slippers and has given away his prized suits and shoes. Annually, he donates Rs 1 lakh to institutes like Child Rights and You (CRY), HelpAge India and Bharat Sevashram Sangha.Mita interrupts to add that he funded her daughter’s education and that he lends a hand whenever she is in need. “During the lockdown, I stayed over for 10 days at a stretch while the other help was home. But dadu paid us both in full. He realises how badly we need the money.”Chatterjee also donated Rs 90,000 — almost the entirety of his monthly pension — to the Covid relief fund as he felt it was the need of the hour. He recalls ghastly incidents of the past century but says none have been like Covid-19. “During the Bengal Famine, I remember seeing starving people on the streets, crying ‘fyan dao’. It was terrible but Covid is different,” says the man who does not approve of the lockdown mechanism.“In terms of economy, India is falling back by 10-15 years by enforcing such a ruthless lockdown. The financial loss is not worth it.”As for his own health, Chatterjee jests that he plans to live past 100 as the government would grant him Rs 1 lakh as pension after that! “Jokes apart, however my end comes, I am confident that I will not suffer,” says the man, reciting a verse from the Bhagwad Gita. “Lord Krishna assures us that he who does no wrong will not suffer and I have lived an honest life.”Mihir Kumar Chatterjee has lived his life so simply that his friends tell him he lives like a beggar. Days before his 99th birthday, this “beggar” of EC Block donated Rs 90,000 to the chief minister’s relief fund to fight Covid-19.“Simple living, high thinking,” says Chatterjee, who turned 99 last Friday. Usually his son and daughter-in-law come down from Delhi to spend this day with him but this year, of course, things are different. He still got lots of phone calls and a visit from well-wishers of institutes he is associated with on the day. “They gifted me books, sweets, a dhoti, a laminated greeting.... Next year when I turn 100 they will hold a big felicitation,” he smiles.Born in Bankura on June 5, 1921, Chatterjee is a product of what were then known as Presidency College and Bengal Engineering College. “I graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1945 and sat for the first and only interview of my life. I got through the PWD test and continued there, retiring in 1979 as housing commissioner,” he says. “Salt Lake’s Karunamoyee was built under my supervision.”Chatterjee’s memory is as sharp as ever.",2020-11-06 13:21:00
1847,Sudeshna Banerjee,Coronavirus: Life in a Covid ward... - Telegraph India,"Sushmita Roy Chowdhury, a chest specialist who is treating Covid-19 patients at Apollo Hospitals, answers some frequently asked questions on the dreaded virus and how to fight it. Over the last week, the resident of Sanjeeva Town has instructed office-bearers of various residential complexes in the NKDA’s newly set-up Covid-19 war room and held an awareness meet for her own neighbours.On identifying Covid-19 symptoms…This is influenza season. But how to recognise the difference between flu and Covid-19? If you are in contact with someone infected and if your nose is blocked, you are suffering from body and head ache, you develop fever and have an upset stomach, have a dry cough and sore throat… it begins with such non-specific symptoms.This flu can affect people in two ways. There are those with influenza-like illness. They have fever over seven-eight days, loose motion, body ache etc. They recover on their own. The other category is severe acute respiratory illness. They have breathing trouble.If a Covid-positive person is over 65, or has diabetes, hypertension, asthma, COPD, kidney disease or is under cancer treatment, he cannot stay at home and should be hospitalised.But it is a good decision of the government to allow patients with mild symptoms to self-isolate at home. One can stay in the comfort of one’s room and avoid expenditure on health while pressure is not added on the healthcare system. But home isolation comes with a caveat — you have to be your own police. You have to be under regular observation or on video call with a doctor you have to report to daily. If shortness of breath develops, you have to go to hospital.It is helpful to keep a pulse oxymeter at hand. It is not expensive, costing less than Rs 2,000. If someone is getting breathless, it is better to check his oxygen saturation level. If the level falls under 93 per cent, immediately go to a designated Covid-19 hospital. Reaching the hospital when oxygen saturation has dropped to 80 per cent is not a smart thing to do as the patient is already in a serious condition.On the type of mask to wear…Cloth masks are no good, neither is N95 needed. Use a three-ply surgical mask. N95 masks are only for those who are dealing with high volume of viral load, such as healthcare workers like us who are working in Covid wards. For example, when nebulisation is being done on a Covid patient and aerosol gets generated, a light mask will not work as there is high risk of virus spread. Someone on home quarantine and his carer can use a three-ply surgical mask. The World Health Organisation has specified that cloth mask should be avoided.On taking public transport…We, from the middle classes, cannot avoid taking public transport while going to work. But if you were used to leaving home at 9.30am, do so at 8.30am now. Be prepared to miss buses if they are too crowded. Do not stand face to face with anyone. If you are travelling in a taxi, roll a window down and let fresh air in even if the AC is on. Sit at the back and make sure the driver is wearing his mask. The mask has to be in place, not under the nose. Otherwise, you are leaving an entry free for infection. The virus has two portals of entry — your nasal passage and your mouth. Wearing gloves makes some people complacent. Don’t touch your mask or your face repeatedly with your gloved hand. Some have a habit of lowering the mask while talking. That is more dangerous. We have to learn to speak with the mask over our nose. People like me working in Covid wards for the last three months should have been infected by now. If that has not happened, it is only because we are taking precautions. This is not such a deadly virus if you take precautions. If it enters our body, no one knows how it will behave. So we have to prevent its entry into our body by taking precautions.On the regimen to follow when coming home from work…Leave your shoes outside the house if there is space to do so. Otherwise put them in a plastic bag and take inside. Many people have a bad habit of spitting on the road, so there is no knowing what your soles are carrying underneath. People are washing vegetables but they care little about shoes. Change out of the clothes you went out in and wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Dump the clothes and wash them separately from other clothes in hot water and soap. This is a weak virus and has a fat layer that gets washed away by soapy water.On eating out…Don’t eat anything outside that has been cooked earlier. If it is piping hot and cooked in a clean environment, it’s ok. Carry food and water from home if you can for the next two months. The less you interact with people the better. In a sweet shop, the sweets may be safe to have but what about the man serving you? How do you know if he is an asymptomatic carrier or not? Infection can spread from the hand if the person is affected. Since there is community spread now, it is wise to reduce interaction. We don’t know whether we have reached the peak (of infection) or not. Two months later, the risk should come down.On asymptomatic carriers…A Covid-positive person doesn’t have to cough to infect others. Of course, when a person is coughing, droplets go out with more force. But even when you talk, there are droplets produced. That is why a distance of two to three metres is suggested even when you are speaking to someone. If you speak loudly, more droplets are generated. When you wear a mask, after an hour or so it starts smelling. This is because droplets are forming a layer inside.On home isolation…Being in home isolation means being confined to a single room with attached toilet. You have been given an opportunity to reduce your viral load in familiar surroundings. Wash your own dishes. Do not share your towel with anyone. Wear a mask at all times. You cannot go out and have dinner or watch TV with the rest of the family. Isolation has to be a disciplined affair. Otherwise you will infect your family. As for waste disposal, the government has a policy which the civic body advises the family about.On a personal level…My family was worried about whether I would get infected. My mother is 79 and stays with me. I was worried about infecting her. At work, the big hurdle was getting used to wearing PPE. You sweat like a pig even in air-conditioned atmosphere. As a consultant, I do my rounds and come out from the Covid ward in about four hours. But my junior colleagues stay in for six to eight hours. They cannot go to the toilet. By the time they come out, their body salts are low, they are hungry, thirsty and dehydrated, and have headaches.PPEs take 20-25 minutes to put on and an equal time to take off. If you are not careful, you can end up infecting yourself while disposing it.As a chest specialist, I do not go to the ward daily. Otherwise, my exposure will be very high. In our hospital, there is a team of six consultants. Each of us visits the ward once a week and discusses cases with others. In the out-patient department too, I do not see more than eight patients per day so there is a gap between patients. My husband, who is also a doctor, has set up the guest room at home for me where I have isolated myself. It has become a habit over these three months.On non-Covid illnesses…Please do not neglect other diseases by avoiding treatment. Hospitals are taking care to separate Covid wards from non-Covid treatment areas. With the rains starting, it is time for the onset of dengue. The symptoms for that too are headache and fever. We are holding fever clinics to separate patients who are found to have more than 99°F temperature in the thermal gun screening at the entry point. Such people are not allowed to go to the OPD.Do you have a Covid-related question for Sushmita Roy Chowdhury?

1849,Debraj Mitra,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: Cable work moves at a snail’s pace in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The city roads will be free of defunct overhead cables in 30 years at the current rate of progress of the teams removing them.Dud cables have been removed from a stretch of Harish Mukhjerjee Road and some areas in Alipore over the past six days.The area covered would be around 3km, said representatives of multi-system operators and broadband Internet service providers who have teamed up to remove dud cables from the roads in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan on May 20.In areas under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the combined length of the roads would be around 5,500km, said a senior official of the civic body.Around a dozen MSOs and broadband service providers deployed teams that covered 3km in six days. At this rate, they would take 11,000 days, or a little over 30 years, to complete 5,500km. Pedestrians are having to wriggle their way past cables hanging dangerously across the city roads every day, three weeks after the storm had struck. On Thursday, a mesh of loosely dangling cables — many of them touching the road — cut a sorry figure on a stretch of Dover Road. They are doubly dangerous in the dark, said a resident.The Telegraph on Thursday published a picture of a senior citizen bending his back to get past low-hanging cables on Girish Avenue.The prod to remove the dud cables came from Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the board of administrators of the CMC. Sources said Hakim called a virtual meeting with executive engineers on Thursday, stressing the need to clear the roads of cable and other debris as soon as possible.He is also scheduled to meet MSOs and broadband players on Friday to take stock of the situation.Civic officials have attributed the high count of electric poles felled by the cyclone to the weight of cables on them.The storm had felled close to 4,500 posts and 15,000 trees, according to official estimates. Clearing the debris of foliage and cables is still on.An MSO director summed up the challenge that awaited them. “Dus saal ka paap hai. Itni jaldi kaise dhulega (The sins of a decade cannot be washed away soon),” he said. Old cables that have long outlived their utility have been dangling from posts, all jumbled up, for years. The teams started with Harish Mukherjee Road last Thursday. A large part of the road was made free of defunct cables before the teams switched to parts of Alipore, said MSO representatives. “While working, our men had inadvertently damaged some cables of DTH players. The police got involved and the work was hampered,” said an official of an MSO.A section of the MSO workforce, depleted by the lockdown, is working to “normalise connections” at places where CMC teams are still removing trees and tilted posts, said an official of another MSO.",2020-11-06 19:34:00
1851,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal: High school and college students help Amphan-hit - Telegraph India,"A group of high school and college students have raised close to Rs 1 lakh to “do their bit” for people in South 24-Parganas and the Sunderbans hit by Cyclone Amphan.The group has been holding an online fest where each participant has to register by paying Rs 100.The idea is to engage people in “our generation” by using the online platform and social media to project the cause and tapping on their hobbies to get them to participate, one of the founders of the initiative said.“We understand that as students our capacity will be lower than any organisation involved in raising funds… but we believe we have to start somewhere,” Indrayani Bhadra, appearing for her Class XII exams from Garden High School this year, said.“The registration fee is Rs 100, which many can pay from their pocket money… at the same time we can build a bigger crowd of people and gather more money to help people hit by the cyclone.”Indrayani and Anwesh Banerjee, appearing for his Class XII exams from Dolna Day School, are the founders of the initiative. There are 15 more students in their group.The group consists mostly of Class XII and students of first year in college who are worried about their careers in these uncertain times. But that has not stopped them from thinking about those who have lost everything to the cyclone.“I am worried because our future is uncertain. But at the same time I have read about students who have lost their homes and books. I have a roof over my head and I can sit for my exams because I still have my books and notes with me,” Udisha, a student of Dolna Day School who has some ISC papers still left, said. “As we are saying participation for charity, some students feel they are putting their talent to good use.”The online activities that are being held under the banner of Aparajito are creative writing, photography, painting/digital art, singing and instrumental music.  There have been entries from teenagers to people in their 50s. The last date of registration for the events is June 10.Udisha said the winners would be given an e-certificate and their work will be posted on social media pages.The students have received entries from people in other cities as well. “There were many people from outside Bengal who were not aware of the extent of damage and destruction that the cyclone had caused… some of them reached out to us after hearing of our initiative,” Indrayani said.The online activities that are being held under the banner of Aparajito are creative writing, photography, painting/digital art, singing and instrumental music. There will be an online Model United Nations as well.There have been entries from teenagers to people in their 50s.

1853,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: ‘Non-Covid-19’ tag to bring back patients - Telegraph India,"Creating “non-Covid” wings for patients not infected by the coronavirus, shifting a patient who has tested positive for the disease to another unit — private hospitals in Calcutta are tweaking their segregation policies because many people are avoiding visiting hospitals.The footfall of patients at most private hospitals has not gone up much even after the lockdown was eased because many people do not want to get admitted where Covid-19 patients are being treated.Most private hospitals, which are not designated as Covid-19 hospitals, have separate wings for patients infected with the virus.But now, officials of several private hospitals said they have changed their segregation policy, creating wings for non-Covid patients which are completely segregated from the rest of the facility.AMRI Hospitals has decided to shift any patient testing positive for Covid-19 at its Dhakuria hospital to its Salt Lake unit.“The Dhakuria unit had three zones — green for patients who tested negative for Covid-19, red for those who tested positive and orange for people who were awaiting test results. Now, there is no red zone,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. “Those who are testing positive at the Dhakuria hospital are being transferred to our Salt Lake unit.”Patients who test positive and need to undergo surgery are kept in a separate area, said Barua. The Covid-positive patients whose surgery can be postponed are being asked to come back to the hospital after they are cured of the viral infection.Peerless Hospital on Wednesday created a wing with 23 single-bed cabins for Covid-negative patients who have been admitted for treatment of other ailments.“The entrance to the wing and the elevator used to ferry patients to this ward are separate from other parts of the hospital. Even the nurses attending to these patients are dedicated for this wing only. The movements are restricted,” said Sudipta Mitra, chief executive of Peerless Hospital.“Many patients and their relatives are calling us to ask how far is the Covid ward from the area where non-Covid patients are kept. These single-bed rooms are created to allay such fears. Those who can pay a higher tariff and are afraid of coming to hospital can take admission.”There are other hospitals which are creating holding areas for patients.At the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences in Mukundapur, the authorities have created a holding area on a dedicated floor comprising several rooms. Each room has two to three patients awaiting test results before getting admitted.“Most tests are done at the outpatient department but for people who need emergency admission because they are suffering from respiratory distress or stomach ache, are now kept in the holding area. The results are coming on the same day and by afternoon, all patients in a room are shifted either to the Covid or non-Covid wards, which are in separate buildings,” said R. Venkatesh, regional director, east, Narayana Health, of which the Mukundapur hospital is a flagship unit.Once the patients are shifted, the rooms are being fumigated, he said. If the flow of patients increase, the holding area will have more rooms.“The fear among patients would continue for another couple of months. Hospitals that don’t have multiple units or separate wings will suffer more because of the fear,” said Alok Roy, chairman, Medica Superspecialty Hospital.",2020-11-06 20:50:00
1855,Kinsuk Basu,Lockdown catch: hilsa bounty hope - Telegraph India,"The monsoon is near and the ilish is not far behind. Scientists who have been studying the migration of hilsa from the saline Bay of Bengal to the sweet waters of Bengal predicted a bountiful crop this year.The primary reason behind the delicious forecast is the relatively cleaner Hooghly. The long lockdown has dramatically reduced the presence of effluents in the river. Lesser effluents means less difficulty for the fish to draw oxygen during their long swim upstream.Besides, a moderate and an eastward wind over the Bay of Bengal bodes well for a feast in the near future. The delicate fish tends to flow with the wind and the onset of the intermittent rain helps in reducing the salinity of the water.With changes in the wind flow and colour of the sky, the ground, er water, is laid for Bengal’s favourite fish to move upstream in large numbers. And once that happens, the hilsa could find its way from the estuary to hitherto forgotten bends of the river at places like Balagarh.Hilsa from the Padma is often more talked about and is sometimes a matter of foreign policy in India-Bangladesh relations. But to many who love the bhapa and the bhaja equally, Ganga-r ilish is nonpareil.“The ilish of the Ganges has a unique taste of its own. We used to get it at our mashi’s place near Kheyaghat in Uttarpara in my childhood,” said Anjan Chatterjee, who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain. “The beauty is when the quality of hilsa is good, the taste of the preparation changes automatically.”The net would be cast from June 15 at the end of a 61-day embargo on hilsa fishing to ensure the fish grow to their optimum size before they are caught and consumed. Around 12,000 fishermen from South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore go out around this time of the year for their catch.Small dinghies are also in action along the river in Calcutta and the haul of silver in ghats like Bagbazar and Uttarpara disappear in minutes. “Many Calcuttans would not know how delectable that local catch is because they are taken away before they make it to big markets,” said a north Calcuttan.Author Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay, too, spoke of that Calcutta catch. “In my childhood, when we used to come to Calcutta, my father would get hilsa from the Ganges. Those were days of World War II and people would buy hilsa from the ghats along the Ganges in the evening when fishermen would return with their catch,” he said. “Ilish is all about emotion for us.”Typically, the hilsa moves from the sea to the river around this time of the year to lay eggs. Scientists said the migration begins from June, when the fish start moving upstream from the estuary looking for breeding sites along the banks. A matured hilsa lays 10 to 12 lakh eggs out of which a very small fraction would see the light of day.“We are now observing that a hilsa weighing around 350g is mature enough to lay good quality eggs. With the Hooghly looking cleaner, a hilsa would find it easier to extract oxygen from the water this year while moving against the stream, upwards,” said Asim Kumar Nath, who has been studying the migration of the fish at Sidho-Kanho-Birsha University.“Once the water gets cleaner with reduced levels of alkalinity and hardness, the bigger varieties of hilsa would start moving up and lay eggs upstream. It would be a treat to get this variety return to their traditional breeding grounds upstream.”Fishermen agree. “We have been observing the waters very closely this time,” said Bijan Maity of the Kakdwip Fishermen Welfare Association. “The setting is perfect with the timely onset of the monsoon and the wind has been blowing strong. This year, the catch would be around 22,000 and 24,000 tonnes,” he added.Last year, it was around 14,000 tonnes.",2020-11-06 20:57:00
1857,Debraj Mitra,Coronavirus lockdown: Hoteliers hold out career hope - Telegraph India,"The slump in business because of the pandemic is not permanent. Once it passes, skilled professionals in the hospitality industry will be back in demand, seasoned hoteliers said at a virtual session on Sunday.Aspiring hospitality professionals should hone their skills and be ready to grab opportunities that come their way as the economy kick-starts, they said.Virtual Insights — an ABP initiative in partnership with IIHM presents a virtual session on “Careers in Global Hospitality Management” was held between 5pm and 6pm on Sunday on Zoom platform. Over 1,000 people — mostly students and their parents — watched the session, according to organisers.“Our industry took the biggest hit. We depend on travel a lot. Since flights are closed… we are facing a challenge. But this is not going to be the new normal. The new normal is going to be same as what it was… with a little more emphasis on hygiene. This is just a phase,” Kumar Shobhan, general manager, Hyatt Regency Kolkata, said.The hospitality industry has overcome challenges in the past, he said, citing “2008, when the economy was completely flat”.Vijay Malhotra, cluster executive chef, ITC Royal Bengal and ITC Sonar, said safety and hygiene audits were not new to the hospitality sector. “We are the torchbearers for all these protocols now being followed at malls and shops.”On recruitments, he said: “The team is going to be spruced up…. Replacements are going to be sought as and when people move out. It is wrong to say that people are not going to be hired. It is just a passing phase where businesses are at a low. But the succession has to carry on. People have to be there… so that they are well-trained and ready to take on the mantle tomorrow when the responsibilities fall on them.”Suborno Bose, chairman and CEO of IIHM and IHC London, moderated the session. “Business cannot continue to happen over virtual platforms,” he said. “Once travel starts picking up, the hospitality sector will bounce back strongly.”Abdullah Ahmed, director, IIHM Delhi and associate director, Indismart Global, delved into the past. “Mankind picks up. It picked up after WW I. It picked up after WW II. It is going to pick up again the same way.”Ahmed asserted that India was poised to recover strongly once the pandemic was over. “We could not be at a better place than India at this point of time. We are 130 crore people. We depend massively on our internal consumption and our internal demand. We produce and we consume — 130 crore people need food, they have desires, they want to buy something. So, the moment Covid-19 passes away, we will be the fastest to pick up.”Multiple questions from viewers centered on the lack of practical training as classes had shifted online.Abdullah said: “We are keeping a tight eye on the situation. As soon as we get government approval, we will start physical classes and practical lessons. We will go for multiple batches a day… work on Sundays. We will ensure you get the required exposure.”",2020-11-08 02:20:00
1858,Our Bureau,Fire breaks out in a building at the crossing of Pollock Street and Hare Street - Telegraph India,"A fire broke out on the third and fourth floor of a five-storey building at the crossing of Pollock Street and Hare Street on Monday.The fire in central Calcutta brought back memories of the fire at Nandaram market, barely 600m from the spot, 12 years ago.People of the area spotted thick black fumes emanating from the building, painted in white, at 18B Brabourne Road around 4.45pm. The building, known locally as PNB Building, has several offices across the floors.The fire brigade was alerted and members of the city police’s disaster management group joined in after a while. It took at least 22 fire engines to bring the blaze under control. Police said there were no casualties.The building, located amidst offices and wholesale markets in Dalhousie, posed a challenge for the fire brigade as the area has several multi-storey buildings in narrow lanes.Hydraulic ladders were used and a joint team of cops and firefighters began work on dousing the flames. Traffic on Brabourne Road was diverted and the area cordoned off.Most offices in the building were shut and the few that had opened in the morning had almost downed their shutters for the day by the time the leaping flames could be spotted from a distance.Firefighters and members of the disasters management group helped people struggling to get down the stairs of the building. Most of them were guards and members of the building’s maintenance team who live in the building, the police said.“One person had to be rescued from the rooftop,” Firhad Hakim, chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, said.He was later identified as Gopa Bondhu Das, 52, a liftman. He was taken to SSKM Hospital where he was treated and discharged.Hakim had turned up at the site, along with fire and police officers. Sujit Bose, the fire and emergency services minister, joined Hakim to oversee the firefighting.“It is still not clear how the fire began. A forensic test will be carried out on Tuesday. The fire was brought under control in three hours,” Bose said.“We were worried because several buildings are close to the one that caught fire,” a person in the area said. “The hydraulic ladders were very helpful.”",2020-11-08 02:29:00

The person sending the messages claimed Goel was using a new phone as he had lost his older one.Worried about the safety and well-being of his cousin, Garg deposited the money into the bank account, the number of which he had received on WhatsApp.A day later, he got to know his cousin hadn’t sent the messages. “He then filed a complaint,” the officer said.Cops started tracking the phone number from which Garg had received the messages and the money trail and zeroed in on Bhavesh Mehta, Nilesh Nimavat and Dhawal Panchami, the police said.They were picked up from their homes. “We tracked down the money trail and arrested all three. We are investigating if anyone else is involved,” the officer said.They have been booked under various IPC sections, including 420 (cheating).A Salt Lake court sent them to police custody for two days.Another investigating officer said the police were trying to find out if the men knew Garg and Goel as the latter’s photograph had been used on WhatsApp.“We will question the men to find out if they know the two brothers. It is likely they do… they knew exactly which photograph to use and were careful to use a number with a US country code,” the officer said.",2020-11-08 03:14:00
1862,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Panel to set Covid patient test norm - Telegraph India,"The regulatory commission for private hospitals has decided to issue a guideline on pathological tests for Covid-19 patients following complaints that some hospitals are conducting unnecessary tests and inflating bills, the chairperson of the commission said on Monday.An eight-member committee of doctors has been formed to frame the guideline, said retired judge Ashim Banerjee, the chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission.Banerjee referred to a case in which a private hospital had billed a patient’s family Rs 23 lakh. The patient, himself a doctor, had passed away at the hospital. “We got hold of the bill and found that Rs 7 lakh had been charged for investigations. Out of that, Rs 5.75 lakh was for pathological tests,” said Banerjee.“We found that one test was done repeatedly. Hence, we decided to form a committee of doctors who can frame a guideline on the kind of tests that are necessary to treat Covid-19.”The commission chairman did not name the hospital.The committee that will prepare the guideline comprises Sukumar Mukherjee and Maitrayee Banerjee, members of the commission; Subhankar Chowdhury, the head of endocrinology at SSKM Hospital; Raja Roy, the head of microbiology at SSKM; Sarbari Swaika, of the critical care department at SSKM; Bibhuti Saha, from the department of tropical medicine at the School of Tropical Medicine; Sushruth Bandopadhyay, a critical care specialist from AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake; and Tanmoy Banerjee, from Medica Superspecialty Hospital.An order issued by the commission’s secretary said the panel would request the “team of experts to prepare such a guideline to help the Covid-19 treatment that would ultimately reduce the financial burden of the patient”.The order also added that the guideline would be “suggestive and recommendatory” and not binding. The doctor treating a patient will have the final call, it added.An official of a private hospital said there was already a team of doctors appointed by the state health department that visited hospitals after every three to four days. The team checks prescriptions, treatment records and whether patients are being given medicines according to the protocol. “The team also checks the kind of tests being done for a patient,” the official said.Chairman Banerjee said the regulatory commission’s aim was to reduce the financial burden on patients and the team of doctors was appointed keeping that in mind.The official of the private hospital said Covid-19 patients who had low oxygen saturation had to undergo an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis routinely. Besides, they have to undergo the liver function test because many of the medicines administered to them are toxic for the liver. Also, Covid-19 patients have to routinely undergo a coagulation profile as their body is often found to develop clots.A member of the committee, however, said he was not sure how the panel would function — whether or not the members need to enter wards to verify how Covid-19 patients are being treated.“There are too many committees now. One committee will overlap with the jurisdiction of another. We are not sure how as members of the committee we are going to find out how patients are being treated and what tests they are being subjected to,” he said.The state government has capped the rate of several items such as personal protective equipment (PPE). It had on June 26 issued an order stating that private hospitals could not charge an indoor patient more than Rs 1,000 a day for PPE and other protective gear. Doctors’ consultation fees for indoor patients have been capped at Rs 1,000 a day and the rate for a Covid-19 test at Rs 2,250.Even after the state government’s intervention, there was no let up in complaints of overcharging. Some hospitals were charging patients separately for gloves and sanitiser. There were complaints that hospitals were charging as much as Rs 450 for dispensing sanitiser and masks at the entrance to outpatient departments.The commission had earlier this month issued a series of advisories capping the rates of several services charged by private hospitals and diagnostic laboratories. Private hospitals should not charge an OPD patient more than Rs 150 for Covid gear and laboratories collecting swab samples from home should not demand any extra payment other than a conveyance fee of Rs 15 a kilometre, it said.",2020-11-08 03:17:00
1863,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus outbreak: Festivity plan scares residents in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"A pandal spanning the width of a road has been erected near the Jodhpur Park market to mark the foundation day of a streetside temple and organise a puja on the occasion of Janmashtami.Members of the Jodhpur Park Baba Loknath Mandir Committee, which is organising the festivities on Tuesday and Wednesday, said nearly 1,000 devotees would be given prasad over two days. Three counters have been set up for that.Many residents said they were scared about the possible impact of a large congregation in the heart of their neighbourhood at a time the number of Covid-19 cases is on the rise. Home to countless elderly people, this south Calcutta neighbourhood went to sleep on Monday night wondering if such celebrations could result in a spike in cases over the next fortnight.An order issued by the Bengal chief secretary on June 8 said “maximum number of persons permitted to enter the places of worship at a time shall be limited to twenty-five (25)”.A ministry of home affairs guideline issued on July 29 said “large public gatherings/congregations continue to remain prohibited”. It added that up to 50 people could be allowed for weddings and up to 20 for last rites or funerals.The organisers of the Jodhpur Park puja defended the scale of the celebrations saying the arrangements “are modest” compared to what happened in previous years. They cited the reduced size of the pandal — “from 240ft-long last year to 40ft this time” — to drive home their point.A member of the organising committee said they had cancelled illumination and a six-day fair, which was a fixture of the festivity, to prevent large gatherings.“Who would keep a check on whether these people are wearing masks or maintaining a distance of at least six feet among themselves,” a resident told Metro.Jodhpur Park residents’ other worry is that many traders from the Jodhpur Park market assemble for the celebrations. “If traders get infected in the gathering, residents may catch the virus from them in the market,” said a resident.Lake police station is aware of the celebrations. An officer of the police station said the celebration had been allowed because it was being held for several years.“They have informed us that they would perform the puja. They will follow government guidelines on holding such programmes,” the officer said.Biswajit Ghosh, the secretary of Jodhpur Park Baba Loknath Mandir Committee, said they were “only holding the rituals but all other celebrations have been cancelled”.“We used to have a six-day fair where nearly 30 stalls selling various items were set up. We had decorative lights done by artists from Chandernagore. All these have been cancelled to avoid a large gathering,” he said.",2020-11-08 03:18:00
1864,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: Jadavpur University aspirants can apply online from August 14 - Telegraph India,"Students aspiring to study humanities or science at the undergraduate level at Jadavpur University can apply online from August 14 to September 4, a notification uploaded on JU’s website says.Applications are to be made online through the university’s website www.jaduniv.edu.in. Details about the admission will be available on the website from August 14.The original plan was to have the site activated on August 10 in keeping with an advisory from the state government, but the start had to be delayed to make the system ready for online payment.“We ran several rounds of checks to ensure that the payment gateway for application and admission fees works smoothly. This caused a little delay,” said a university official.The higher education department has ordered that this year fees would have to be paid online or through designated banks. Candidates have been barred from paying the fees on the campus as a precaution against Covid-19.“Till last year, those who had the facility could make an online payment. Those who did not, had to go to a bank. This year it will be entirely online so that aspirants do not have to step out of home,” an official said.Each department will publish a provisional merit list as well as a list of provisionally selected candidates for admission. After verification, the provisionally selected candidates of each department will get a link to pay the admission fee online.“The admission fee has to be paid within three working days of getting the link, failing which the candidature will lapse,” said another official.Among the seven departments in humanities, five — English, comparative literature, international relations, sociology and Sanskrit — will admit students based on their plus-II board marks. The Bengali and economics departments will admit candidates based on their plus-II and Class X board marks.In science, while selecting students from the Bengal board, the university will consider marks in the higher secondary as well as Madhyamik exams. Students from the CBSE and the ISC council will be selected based on their plus-II board marks.Classes are likely to start in mid-September. The teachers have suggested that study materials — notes, soft copies of textbooks, powerpoint presentations, and audio and video lectures — be delivered to the students through email and WhatsApp.The university will carry out a survey among students to find out who need smartphones, which are required to download study materials.",2020-11-08 03:22:00
1865,Sanjay Mandal,Covid: Hospital deposit leaves Kolkata doctor ‘aghast’  - Telegraph India,"The Bengal health regulatory commission’s permission to private hospitals to take deposits for admissions and ask for removal of  patients within one hour after a 12-hour window belies its mandate of protecting patients, a senior doctor at the forefront of the Mamata Banerjee government’s fight against Covid-19 said on Monday.“Saturday’s advisory allowing private hospitals to seek deposits (up to Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated treatment cost, whichever is less) during admission defeats the purpose for which chief minister Mamata Banerjee had created the commission,” said the doctor who requested anonymity because he did not want his opinion to be misinterpreted as a sign of divisions or an attempt at building personal popularity.“The commission’s mandate was to address the grievances of people in distress who had gone to hospitals,” added the doctor, who is part of the chief minister’s core Covid combat team.“The commission says it’s trying to strike a balance — but is it its job to strike a balance or to give relief to patients at a time Covid-19 has snuffed out livelihoods?Such regulatory bodies should be treading more carefully while trying to strike a balance between the fleecing of patients and keeping the private facilities viable,” he said.The doctor said the legitimisation of the “deposit culture” had left him “aghast”.Retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairperson of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission, had said on Saturday that the amount had been fixed for the benefit of both the patients and the hospitals.No response could be ascertained from Banerjee on Monday evening to the doctor’s views as the retired judge had an appointment.The senior doctor said a fear of having to pay deposits could now give people with Covid-19 symptoms one more reason not to visit hospitals.Saturday’s advisory said that if a patient was unable to pay the deposit during admission, the hospital should provide “provisional admission and give adequate necessary treatment required right at that moment”.But if the patient’s family fails to cough up the amount within 12 hours, the hospital “would be at liberty to cancel the provisional admission and ask the patient party to take back the patient within one hour thereafter”.On Monday, the senior doctor from Mamata’s Covid team said: “This could lead to some hospitals not starting the treatment even for critical patients. If they are put in the ICU and the relatives fail to pay the deposit, the patient can’t (morally) be shifted out. This (clause) might lead to more conflicts rather than solving the problem.”Some private hospitals, too, have complained about this clause. The CEO of a private hospital said it would be inhuman to remove such patients or have them shifted to another hospital.A state health department official said the authorities would go through the advisory in detail and then have a discussion with the commission “if necessary”.Another doctor, a member of the commission, raised similar questions.He said the commission had on Monday met to hear grievances lodged by patients and their relatives. “Most of the complaints against private hospitals were about billing. Only a few had complained about medical negligence. This crisis has left people short of cash, and billing is the biggest issue,” he said.Mamata had created the commission in February 2017 following widespread complaints against private hospitals over billing and treatment.“(Do) I have to sell my house, land, valuables, everything (for hospital treatment)? Give my land deeds and fixed deposit? Finish my life? It has to be kept in mind that there’s a social responsibility,” Mamata had said.Apurba Ghosh, senior paediatrician and director of the Institute of Child Health, said the state government should try to ascertain what benefits the private hospitals had received from it while setting up their units.“Many hospitals got land very cheap or almost free from the government on the understanding that they would treat some patients free of cost. This is the time for those hospitals to do it. The government should ask them why they are not doing so,” Ghosh said.He said his hospital, run on a no-profit basis, too asks for small sums as deposits from the patients. But if they are unable to pay up, treatment is not stopped.",2020-11-08 03:28:00
1866,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus lockdown: Students find parents too caught up with phones - Telegraph India,"Teenagers value family time but often find parents preoccupied with their devices and not trusting them to do something productive on the Net, a group of students have said.Students of various schools attended a workshop for parents on positive parenting — organised by a city school which wanted parents to understand what their children want from them and where they maybe going wrong — on Saturday.Parents should know how to give children time when they are ask for it instead of fiddling with their phones or watching TV, the head of a school said.The gadget can be a “distraction” for an adolescent or a teenager as well as for adults who, too, fail to use it “responsibly” many times, a teacher said.Julien Day School, Ganganagar, organised the workshop on positive parenting for parents of students of Classes IX to XII. Students of various schools voiced their thoughts during the workshop and parents heard them out.“The session was organised to let children tell their parents directly what they want from them. Often, parents do not do a lot of things intentionally but it creates pressure on children even without parents realising,” Bobby Baxter, principal of Julien Day School, Ganganagar, said.“Children need to spend time on the phone or the Internet… to talk to their friends and they don’t need parents to breathe down their neck always,” he said.A teenager said they valued the time they could spend with their families but parents were busy browsing the Net or on social media.“Whenever teenagers are on the computer or phone it does not mean that we are aimlessly browsing… on many occasions we do productive work. Parents need to trust their children,” Sreejib Pal, a Class XI student of Julien Day, said. “Online classes are tiring and we need breaks where we can refresh ourselves.”Often parents ignore signals because they are too preoccupied with their devices, according to teachers. “At times parents have to be sensitive to pick up the signals… when the child needs a break from studies, when they need to sit and watch TV or a film together and it is not necessarily passive viewing,” Amita Prasad, director of Indus Valley World School, said.“Children can understand when parents are hard at work and when they are not. Adults should have a sense of responsibility and not be slaves to gadgets always but know when they have to keep it away. They need to behave more maturely with gadgets and not behave as teenagers,” Prasad said.The pandemic has forced children to be inside homes for months and the feeling of not being heard can be very dominant in the absence of school and friends, according to psychiatrists.“Children are used to their voices being heard by their peers and teachers. On many occasions teachers listen to children more than parents… since that school space is obliterated they need to be heard by their parents,” psychiatrist Jai Ranjan Ram said.“The use of a phone is a serious concern and instead of blaming children always for overuse, parents need to lead by example so that their instructions do not seem hollow.”“When the lockdown began parents did not know how they would spend so much time with their children because their day was structured in a certain way… whether it was spending time with their devices or at work,” Reeta Chatterjee, administrator at Apeejay Schools, said.“If a teenager is on the phone it can separate him/her from the family… similarly if parents are on the phone it will have the same impact on family life,” Aditi Bhattacharya, a Class XI student of The Central Modern School, Barasat said.Aditi said their parents were usually not single children like them. “Most of us are single child… we need that fruitful communication.”",2020-11-08 03:30:00
1867,Kinsuk Basu,"Supply hit, chilli price at Rs 300 a kilo - Telegraph India","The price of green chillies has touched Rs 300 a kilo in the city, up from around Rs 200 a couple of weeks back, with traders blaming the steep hike on erratic supply from other states in the run up to lockdown days.Green chillies usually sell for Rs 40 to Rs 60 a kilo in the city around this time.In contrast, the retail price at the Maniktala, Gariahat, Lake market, Entally, Kasba and Behala markets has remained around Rs 300 a kilo for three consecutive days since Saturday.At other markets, the price varied between Rs 250 and Rs 280 a kilo on Monday.Bengal produces around 9.5 to 10 lakh tonnes of green chillies a year, compared with its annual demand of eight lakh tonnes. It remains one of the biggest suppliers of green chillies to other states.But around this time of the year, Bengal has to depend on supplies from other states.Officials at the wholesale hubs in Sealdah and Howrah said that ahead of the lockdowns on August 5 and 8, trucks carrying chillies from other states got stranded at various points. Also, trucks from Nadia and North 24-Parganas were allegedly stopped at Boro Jagulia, Barasat and Kanchrapara, further widening the gap between the supply and the demand.“Nine trucks carrying 15 tonnes of green chillies from Aurangabad’s Buldhana were stranded at different points on August 5. The impact was felt almost immediately,” said Kamal  Dey, the working president of the West Bengal Vendors’ Association. “The wholesale price of chillies stood at Rs 105 a kilo on August 6. It shot up to Rs 150 the next day as the demand soared.”Green chillies, like other vegetables, are highly perishable. Traders said a delay of a few hours on transit could result in a loss of nearly 40 per cent of the produce from each bag. Reduced volume and high demand ahead of the lockdown pushed up the price.“I bought four pallas (one pallah weighs 5kg) of green chillies on Tuesday (August 4) for Rs 110 a kilo from Sealdah. Nearly 25 per cent of the total buy was lost on the two lockdown days. I have no option but to sell the remaining for Rs 300 a kilo,” said Subol Saha, a vegetable vendor at Lake market.“Since local trains are not running, the bulk of the supplies from the districts to Sealdah is dependent on trucks. There are obstacles on the roads, I’m told,” said Pradip Mazumder, adviser to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on agriculture and chairman of West Bengal Agro Industries Corporation Limited. “We have started working on these bottle-necks.”Police officers said there were complaints that trucks carrying vegetables were being stopped. “Orders have been sent to the police superintendents to ensure it doesn’t happen,” said an officer.The state government has decided to regularly monitor the prices of some essential commodities such as potatoes and chillies.The price of potatoes, too, has risen from Rs 25 a kilo a few weeks ago to Rs 35. At a meeting in Nabanna last week, potato producers were asked to ensure that the Jyoti variety reached wholesale markets at Rs 23 a kilo.",2020-11-08 03:40:00
1868,Our Special Correspondent,Coronavirus lockdown: Six-city flight ban extended till August 31 - Telegraph India,"The ban on flights to Calcutta from six cities with high Covid prevalence, including Delhi and Mumbai, will be extended till August 31, officials said.The ban was to expire on August 15.“I am further directed to inform you that the suspension of flights from the aforesaid cities to Kolkata will continue till 31 August, 2020,” reads a letter from Bengal’s home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay to civil aviation secretary P.S. Kharola.“We’ll announce the extension of the ban in a day or two,” said an official of the Calcutta airport.The ban on flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Pune, Nagpur and Ahmedabad, which have been reporting a large number of Covid-19 cases every day, kicked in on July 6 following a request from the Bengal government. The ban was till July 19 but was extended till July 31 and then till August 15.Airlines had opened bookings for flights between Calcutta and these cities post-August 15 but tour operators said they were not taking any bookings.“Every time passengers have to cancel or rebook. We will book tickets to these six cities only after the state government formally announces resumption of operations. Till then we are booking passengers to these places through other cities,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, Travel Agents Federation of India.An airport official said airlines were suffering heavy losses because of the ban. “The flights to Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai carry at least 25 per cent more passengers compared with flights to other cities,” he said.",2020-11-08 03:49:00
1869,Debraj Mitra,How to catch a Metro from Monday in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The first Metro train on commercial run in 174 days will leave the terminal stations at 8am on Monday but booking of e-passes will start at 8pm on Sunday, officials of the utility said.The timings, number of trains and their frequency have been changed. The last trains will leave the terminal stations at 7pm.“Only smart card users will be allowed to travel by Metro trains,” said Metro general manager Manoj Joshi. New smart cards can be bought from stations — at counters and smart card vending machines at some stations. Existing smart card users can recharge at stations or online — from the Metro app and website.The smart card will be for access to the platform. To enter a station, a person needs a “QR code-based colour coded e-pass”. The following steps have to be taken to get a pass:The passenger will have to show the pass at the station gate and enter the station at any time in the designated slot.“There will be 12 colour codes, each for entry during one slot. The colour for each slot will be known by cops posted at the gates,” said a representative of the agency which has developed the system.If one books a pass from a smartphone, the colour-coded pass will be downloaded in the service. General manager Joshi said people without phones can access the link through a computer and take a colour print-out of the pass. But Metro sources said the carrier did not expect many people without phones to turn up at the stations.The booking window will open 12 hours before the first train of the day.“The URL will go live from 8pm on Sunday. Monday’s passes will be available from 8pm on Sunday to 7.59pm on Monday. From 8pm on Monday, Tuesday’s passes will be available on the system,” an official said.The pass is only for entry into the station. For platform access, a smart card is a must, said Metro officials.An algorithm — based on data provided by Metro Railway — that is driving the system has also computed an estimated volume of passengers expected to enter and exit each station within each slot. Around 1,000 people are expected to board trains from Dum Dum between 8am and 9am on Monday, said the developer. During the same slot, only 25 are expected to board trains from Park Street.The e-passes will be allotted to passengers based on these calculations. A set of standard operating procedures — based on these computations — has also been shared with the police for deployment at stations. The idea is to have more deployment at stations where more passengers are expected.All but two stations will have one gate each for entry and exit. Dum Dum and Esplanade will have two gates each for both.“We used to carry over 3,000 passengers on a train during peak rush. If that number has to be brought down to 400 per train, we need some checks,” said an official.The carrier hopes to ferry 100,000 to 120,000 people every day. The pre-Covid daily count was over 600,000.Metro had suspended service on March 23 as a precaution against Covid-19. Monday’s service will mark the first commercial run since. On Sunday, Metro will run trains for free for NEET candidates and their guardians.From Monday, according to officials, 50 passengers will be allowed in each of the eight coaches and they have to keep the space of one seat in between.Passengers will also have to wear masks and undergo thermal scanning at the station entrances.   The first and last trains will now leave the terminal stations at 8am and 7pm, respectively. The previous timings were 6.45am and 9.55pm. “Many of our staff were dependent on suburban trains to come to work and go home. Since trains are suspended now, they will have to leave a little early,” said Indrani Banerjee, the Metro spokesperson.",2020-11-09 02:19:00
1870,Subhankar Chowdhury,UGC okays state final semester exam plan - Telegraph India,"The University Grants Commission on Thursday okayed the state higher education department’s proposal to hold final-year undergraduate and postgraduate exams between October 1 and 18, a department official said.Education minister Partha Chatterjee had on August 31 announced that state-aided universities will have to conduct the end semester exams between October 1 and 18. But universities did not announce the exam schedule as the UGC was still to approve the dates, as mandated by the Supreme Court in its August 28 order.If any state or Union territory, in exercise of the jurisdiction of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, decides it is not possible to hold the exams by September 30 in keeping with UGC’s July 6 advisory, it can seek an extension from the UGC, the apex court had said.Manish Jain, the higher education department principal secretary, had on September 2 sought the UGC’s permission in a letter to its chairman.The UGC gave its permission on Thursday and universities have been advised to announce the exam schedule at the earliest, a department official said.Jadavpur University will hold the end semester exams in arts and science between October 1 and 10, university pro vice-chancellor Pradip Ghosh said on Thursday afternoon. “A notification with the detailed schedule will be issued soon.”Earlier this week, the university had finalised the modalities for holding the exams and students started filling forms. The schedule hadn’t been announced, though.Soma Bandyopadhyay, the vice-chancellor of the West Bengal University of Teachers’ Training, said BEd and MEd final semester exams would be held between October 1 and 9.North Bengal University will hold the end semester exams from October 1 to 8, vice-chancellor Subiresh Bhattacharya said.Calcutta University will hold the end semester exams between October 1 and 18, an official said.All the universities feel students should not have to take the exams on the campus in the middle of the pandemic. Questions papers will be emailed or sent via WhatsApp.Jadavpur University has announced to provide students with smartphones and high-speed data packs so that everyone can take the exams.Calcutta University has plans to upload final-year and end semester undergraduate question papers on its website.Candidates can take the exams at their homes and mail back the answers or send them over WhatsApp within 24 hours.Among the state universities, six, including JU, had published the results in July, following the state higher education department’s June 27 directive that recommended graduating students be evaluated based on their performance in previous semesters and internal assessments.",2020-11-09 02:21:00
1871,Subhajoy Roy,Disabled patient accuses Kolkata lab of being unfriendly - Telegraph India,"A 33-year-old physically challenged woman has lodged a complaint with the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission against a diagnostic centre saying the USG room or the washrooms there were not equipped for a person with physical disabilities, the panel chairperson said on Thursday.The woman has told the commission that she faced difficulties when she went to Quadra Medical Services, on Hazra Road, for an ultrasonography test in August last year. The woman approached the commission in January this year.The woman’s complaint has brought to the fore an issue that is not restricted to one clinical establishment. Only a handful of public spaces in the city have facilities that can make visits by physically challenged people free of troubles.During the hearing conducted by the commission on Thursday, an official from Quadra said they were unable to create a washroom designed for the physically challenged as they did not have any more space in the building and any new construction would violate rules of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).Retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the commission, said they had told the CMC requesting it to consider offering some relaxation to Quadra so it could do the needful.“The woman told us that she faced problems both in the room where ultrasonography was done and also while using washrooms. We have told the CMC to consider the case in a humanitarian context and see if they can allow some relaxation to construct a toilet for the physically challenged people,” Banerjee said.People with physical disabilities face similar problems at clinical establishments across the city, said disability rights activists, doctors, civic officials and architects.Jeeja Ghosh, a disability rights activist, said most public spaces in the city were not friendly for people with disabilities. “It is a problem that is faced everywhere. The door in washrooms meant for people with disabilities must be wider than a door in washrooms for people without disabilities. Besides, the basins and urinals must be at a lower height so that someone who is in a wheelchair can use them. Also, there should be handrails on the walls,” Ghosh said.The CMC’s Building Rules, 2009, do mention that all public utility buildings should have “disabled friendly devices like ramps with railing, toilet and drinking water facilities. Braille or auditory signals shall be provided in all lifts”.Not all public utility buildings adhere to the rules. Moreover, the buildings that came up or the building plans approved before 2009 often did not make provisions for people with disabilities.Architect Abin Chaudhuri said the National Building Code had very clear instructions on what facilities a public utility should have to welcome people with disabilities.“The code is detailed and clear. I also think the civic authorities should make a rule that forces owners of old public utility buildings to make changes so the buildings become friendly to physically challenged people. They should do whatever is possible within the structure. No one stops them from doing that,” he said. “But none would do so till the authorities force them. That is why a rule or a law is needed to that effect.”In the case of Quadra, the building has ramps and lifts but no toilet especially designed for the physically challenged.“We do not deny that this is a problem. After the woman complained to us, we fitted hand railings on the walls of our washrooms. But we do not have space to construct a new washroom for people with disabilities. If the CMC offers some relaxation, we can build a washroom,” said Pinak Pani Bhattacharya, one of the directors of Quadra.A CMC official said Quadra did not need their permission to lower the height of basins, urinals or commode.The clinical establishment regulatory commission on Thursday asked Midland Nursing Home, In Belghoria,  to deposit Rs 5 lakh with it after it found that the hospital was prima facie negligent in dealing with an 18-year-old who went there in July. The teenager died subsequently.“The youth’s mother lodged a complaint saying he was taken to Midland... . Midland conducted a rapid test and said the teenager was Covid  positive. They asked the family to take him elsewhere,” said Banerjee.During Thursday’s hearing, Midland officials said the hospital was not equipped to treat Covid patients.“We told them they should have given him some treatment. We have asked the nursing home to file an affidavit explaining what med-ical aid they had extended to the patient. We have asked Midland to deposit Rs 5 lakh as an interim measure…. Prima facie, it seems they were negligent,” said Banerjee.An official of Midland, when contacted, said he was on medical leave and would not be able to speak.",2020-11-09 02:30:00
1872,Jhinuk Mazumdar,UK visa rule tweak to aid students - Telegraph India,"The UK has announced a new points-based immigration system that will replace the previous Tier 4 visa route and promises to make the process “more streamlined” and simplified for students and their institutes in that country.The new Student Route will open for international students on October 5, the British high commission in New Delhi said in a statement issued on Thursday.“Under the new system, students will require a total of 70 points to be granted a visa. They will achieve the required points if they can demonstrate that they have an offer from an approved educational institution, speak English and are able to support themselves during their studies in the UK,” the release said.Under the new system, students will also be able to make a visa application up to six months  before their course starts, unlike three months under Tier 4, and they will not be required to resubmit proof of academic qualifications with their visa application.The statement also mentions that the UK recognises that a section of overseas students is opting to defer their entry into courses in the UK till the spring semester of 2021 because of Covid-19 and says the new visa route will benefit them.The Graduate route for international students to allow them to work or look for work will open in summer 2021, the statement said. ""This will allow eligible international students... who have completed undergraduate and master's degree to stay for two years and those who have completed a PhD to stay for three years to work or look for work.”Jan Thompson, the UK’s acting high commissioner to India, said: “India accounts for one of the UK's largest groups of international students…. Now that we have left the EU, we can introduce this streamlined visa route and the Graduate Route in summer 2021, to ensure the brightest and the best students continue to pick the UK.”Barbara Wickham, director, British Council India, said: “The new Student route is a welcome announcement…. It offers greater flexibility and ease of immigration for applicants.”",2020-11-09 02:31:00
1873,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Kolkata school gives tech lessons to parents - Telegraph India,"Two schools on the city’s northern outskirts have been training parents on the basics of technology so that they can help their children with online learning.St Augustine’s Day School, which has branches in Barrackpore and Shyamnagar, have been explaining to parents the know-how of online classes, how to enter a class when a teacher shares a link or how to scan and upload assignments.The training programme is for parents whose children are in nursery and from classes I-VI. The school authorities realised that beyond that age students are “savvy enough online” and can handle online classes and assignments by themselves.Parents who want some help are coming to school for the sessions with the teachers because the school realised there were some parents who were struggling and that they required help.“While children were attending classes a lot of queries came from parents who sat with them. There are things they were unable to do online and needed help; so, we realised we should guide them,” Janet Gasper Chowdhury, the president of St Augustine’s Education Society, which runs the two schools, said. “It’s not that everybody has issues with technology but a large section does.”The Barrackpore school has a strength of 2,800 and the Shyamnagar one 1,500 up to Class VI.The sessions will be for an hour or two depending on the requirement and though it is open to both parents the school has noticed either the father or the mother has been opting for it.Schoolteachers, whether in the city or outside, have switched to the online mode of teaching during the pandemic. But it is also a challenge for parents to guide their children with the devices and how they are used when they themselves might not be comfortable with them.“I went to school yesterday and cleared my doubts about uploading assignments on the online platform. In fact, I was facing problems with links and once we got disconnected we were finding it difficult to rejoin,” Avijit Dey whose son is in the Shyamnagar school said on Thursday.Many parents said it was easier and comfortable to seek clarification from teachers in person rather than ask them during online classes.The pandemic and the subsequent online classes have been an eye-opener for both parents and schools when it came to handling smart devices.“It was a shock… we noticed many parents did not have smartphones and many were not savvy with their usage and applications apart from making phone calls,” Gasper Chowdhury said.On many occasions, the children who are adept at it will not help their parents because they are apprehensive that they will join social media platforms that children frequent.For the pre-primary, the school has been training parents on how they should teach their kids at home.“We train them in the Montessori method of teaching. We don’t want the child to get another set of instructions at home,” Gasper Chowdhury said.",2020-11-09 02:32:00
1874,Anasuya Basu,Virtual tour of Victoria Memorial Hall - Telegraph India,"A virtual tour of the Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH) garden, accompanied by notes on the various landmarks within the precincts, is available at the Google Arts and Culture website.Titled The Taj of the Raj: The Victoria Memorial Hall and its Gardens, the tour takes the virtual visitor through lush green surroundings of the memorial with a commentary on the architectural pieces and the history of the garden.1500“We will soon have a link of this virtual tour at our official VMH website. Google Arts and Culture will also do a virtual tour of our galleries,” said Jayanta Sengupta, curator, VMH.The marble monument and the garden have been off limits to visitors since March 15 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. On March 15, the most visited museum in the country had recorded a footfall of 11,000.Not just tourists from outside, the VMH with its 57-acre garden attracts even the Calcuttan for a daily stroll amidst its greens. But how many really know the various landmarks on the campus and the stories behind them?Memorial enthusiasts keen to know the history of the landmarks can take the virtual tour. The tour informs the viewer, for instance, that the identical ornamental cast iron gates on the northern and southern sides were designed by Vincent Esch, who was the superintending architect of the Memorial, during its construction in 1921 and was “shipped in whole from England”.The garden scheme was drawn up in 1915 by landscape gardeners and architects, along with experts like David Prain (who was director of the Botanical Survey of India, Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, and he Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew Gardens, London) and the first Earl Redesdale (acknowledged as one of the greatest amateur authorities on the subject at the time).The 57-acre Memorial campus includes the garden, the museum, six water bodies, nearly 2,800 trees, shrubs and hedges representing 80 species and a nursery garden.The tour focuses on the King Edward VII Memorial Arch with a bronze equestrian statue of the king, the eldest son of Queen Victoria, the marble statue of Lord Curzon right in front of the southern façade of the building and the bronze statue of Queen Victoria on the northern side of the campus.Sculpted by Sir George Frampton, a renowned sculptor of his time, Victoria’s statue was installed in 1901 on Red Road but was subsequently moved in front of the VMH building in 1921.Lord Curzon, who was the viceroy of British India from 1899 to 1905, played a key role in the making of the memorial. Views of the chhatri style pavilions on the four corner turrets exemplify the Indo-Saracenic architecture in India.A black-and white marble floored terrace runs around the building above the basement and provides access to two colonnaded areas, the Eastern and Western Quadrangles, which are popular spaces used for public programmes. The front lobby in the northern (main) entrance of the Hall, is also on view.A 360-degree view of each of these spots is provided and a virtual visitor can amble along a few paces at each of these spots that provide a real-time feel and view.",2020-11-09 02:33:00
1875,Kinsuk Basu,Scramble for milk dries up Kolkata stock - Telegraph India,"The supply of milk was way short of the demand across the city on Thursday morning as people tried to stock up for Friday and Saturday, the two total lockdown days.By evening, the government had called off the total lockdown on Saturday (September 12).The government hasn’t kept milk on the list of essential commodities that enjoy relaxation during days of total lockdown and so the rush to stock up.A shop owner at Gariahat who stocks multiple brands of milk said the demand was almost three times the normal. “Regular customers who usually buy four packets of milk in the morning asked for 12 packets. Some called up and placed their orders in advance,” he said.Every morning, Calcutta and its adjoining areas require around 1.5 million litres of milk. Amul with close to 700,000 litres is the market leader followed by Red Cow with close to 200,000 litres. Mother Dairy and Metro Dairy supply about 170,000 litres each.Officials of various dairies quoted distributors as saying retailers had possibly not realised the extent of the demand.Besides, what contributed to the spike was Jitiya Puja, which is observed by people hailing from parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.Many distributors said they did not place full orders because retailers were unsure if they could store the unsold milk. Two days of lockdown would have posed a challenge in storing unsold packets of milk in the right temperature.“Milk is a perishable item that reaches outlets from the plants and it needs to be stored at eight degrees centigrade or below,” Abhijit Maity of Amul said.The company has 450 distributors catering to more than 17,000 outlets across the state.Some retail chains like Spencers have a cold chain mechanism wherein they can preserve milk almost at the same temperature as that of the plants where it is produced. But even these outlets ran short of supply on Thursday evening.“We only have Tetra Paks. Milk packets are sold out,” an executive of Spencers at Acropolis Mall said in the evening.Large parts of Ballygunge, Gariahat, Kasba, Tollygunge, and Behala in the south and Maniktala, Phoolbagan, Kankurgachhi, Lake Town, and Kalinidi in the north ran out of milk by 11am on Thursday.There is another problem as well.“It is difficult to meet a sudden surge in demand. Every plant has a maximum capacity of production and that can’t be increased overnight,” Sushmita Mukherjee, the chief general manager of Mother Dairy, said.The company has close to 200 outlets of its own and 150 kiosks.",2020-11-09 02:35:00
1876,Subhajoy Roy,Covid waste finds its way to yellow bins in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Yellow bins on Calcutta’s roads are now being put to better use. About 70 per cent of the waste in them is Covid or biomedical waste, the agency that cleans the bins on the civic body’s behalf has said.The bins have labels saying they are meant for Covid waste. Other biomedical waste, too, can also be dumped in the bins, an official of the agency said. Discarded masks, gloves, PPEs, syringes, cottons, sanitary napkins, used medicine strips and bandages can be dumped in these bins.Metro had on August 22 reported that the bins had been filled with food and kitchen waste and construction and demolition waste, none of which is meant to be dumped in them.“The Calcutta Municipal Corporation ran awareness campaigns in several places about what to dump in these bins. Besides, media reports helped in making people more aware,” Ramakant Burman, an official of GreenTech Environ, the agency, said.“We are now getting nearly 70 per cent biomedical waste in the bins. Some people, though, still dump kitchen waste and construction and demolition waste.”The agency clears the bins once every week. The CMC has installed 200 bins across the city for people to dump Covid waste, Burman said.After the yellow bins were installed across the city, the collection of waste from Covid positive people in home isolation has gone down, the official of the agency said. “Earlier, we used to collect Covid waste from 200-odd homes every day. Now, we are collecting waste from 50 homes in a day. It seems most people are dumping Covid waste in the yellow bins.”The agency now receives fewer calls from civic officials asking its officials to collect PPEs lying on the road. “We are collecting plenty of PPEs from the bins. It seems a lot of private practitioners and other people who wear PPEs are dumping them in the bins,” the official said.Apart from Covid waste, people can dump any biomedical waste in the bins, Burman said. “Any waste that is contaminated with body fluid is considered as biomedical waste.”The waste collected from the bins is taken to a plant belonging to the agency and burnt. The residual ash is sent to an engineered landfill in Haldia, he said.",2020-11-09 02:37:00
1877,Subhankar Chowdhury,Jadavpur University teacher files police complaint - Telegraph India,"A Jadavpur University teacher who was identified by her “Adivasi” background by a student of another institution and told that she was not qualified to comment on exams has written to Jadavpur police station what she has been facing on social media.The associate professor’s writing on Facebook that an academic year could not be more important than a student’s life was the trigger.Maroona Murmu told Metro that the experience was “dehumanising and amounting to harassment”.She lodged a formal complaint with the police station eight days after she had faced the student’s rant because she continues to be trolled and the student had defended whatever she had said in a post on social media, Murmu said on Thursday.The complaint, running into four pages, was mailed to the officer in charge of Jadavpur police station early on Thursday.“In the complaint I have narrated the chronology of what I experienced on my Facebook wall, starting from September 2 when the student — whom I did not know — posted comments identifying me by my ‘Adivasi’ background and said in various ways that I was not qualified to comment on examinations given my background. These comments are dehumanising and amount to harassment. I have asked the police to do what they deem fit based on the complaint,” she said.The associate professor of JU's history department said the post the student had put out on social media on Monday night virtually defending what she had earlier said “was another round of humiliation”. “Following legal advice, I decided to lodge the complaint.”She has said in her complaint that the actions of the student of a government college in the city fall under the SC/ST atrocities prevention act, Murmu, who has been teaching at JU for over a decade, said.“In the complaint I have written, it also falls under sections of the IPC, which describe offences about promoting enmity in different groups on grounds of religion, race, creed, place of birth. I want the police administration to take it up,” Murmu said.The teacher said 1,900 comments in support of the student had flooded her comment box when she sent the complaint.She told this newspaper: “I feel that certain rights of mine, both as an individual and also as a person belonging to a particular ethnic background, have been violated.”Murmu said someone sent her a screenshot suggesting that hashtags like #stopreservation and #shameeonmurmu has been created to express support for the accused. “Presently Murmu Ji is spewing hatred against… (she has named the student). Our first order of business would be to stall her. Plz friends report against her profile in every social media platform,” says one purported post from this group. An officer at Lalbazar said cops had taken cognisance of the complaint and an FIR would be lodged. “We are in touch with Jadavpur police station,” the officer said.The exchange between Murmu and the student had taken place on September 2 when most people in the country were debating the central government’s decision to conduct exams despite the pandemic.Commenting on a friend’s post, the JU teacher had written on Facebook: “One year in this long life cannot be bigger than life itself, no exams this time.”The student responded saying: “Maroona Murmu, that’s what surprised me…. How could a professor of JU think like that…. I am astonished…. I don’t want to belittle you, but this is the difference between quota and unquota…. You don’t need to be a so-called professor to understand that life is more important than life’s one year…. The problem is not about missing a year…. It is about progress because of caste and being disadvantaged for life despite having the ability….”After she found a battery of takers, the student had posted on September 3: “This morning, just reminded one ‘Murmu’ Santhali in restrained language that she is an Adivasi…. But some uncles and aunts of her age reminded me that some so-called professors sitting at home have grown a thicker layer of fat.”",2020-11-09 02:38:00

She walked twice during the day in her cabin, said an official of Ruby General Hospital, where the 48-year-old woman is undergoing treatment.“She responded very well to doctor’s instructions. Doctors are satisfied with the way her wound is healing,” the official said. She will be made to walk in her cabin on Friday, too. If the progress is satisfactory, doctors will try to make her walk in the corridor on Saturday.“If everything goes according to plan, we may discharge her on Sunday,” the official said.Nilanjana was returning home with her husband in their car when she heard screams of a woman inside another car. Her husband stopped their car blocking the way of the other car, a Honda City. The woman, who was screaming, was then allegedly thrown out of the car.When Nilanjana reached out to the woman, the man at the wheel of the Honda City, identified as Abhishek Kumar Pandey, pressed the accelerator and fled. The car ran over Nilanjana’s left leg. She suffered fractures in the tibia and fibula of her left leg. Pandey has been arrested.The woman who was allegedly beaten and thrown off the Honda City got her statement recorded before a magistrate in the Alipore court on Thursday.The statement can be considered as primary evidence in court as it has been recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC.Nilanjana’s husband Deep Satpati, who was a witness to the incident, also got his statement recorded before the magistrate on Thursday.The police carried out a reconstruction of Saturday night’s incident by taking the accused with them to the spot on Wednesday night.",2020-11-09 02:45:00
1879,Brinda Sarkar,Coronavirus effect on education: When school goes online - Telegraph India,"Who would have thought class would one day be disrupted by pets? “This student has five pet dogs and they climb over and under her whenever she performs asanas,” laughs Mousumi Mukherjee, an FE Block resident who teaches yoga and history to students of Our Lady Queen of the Missions, Salt Lake. “The dogs’ wagging tails have knocked the student’s phone off the table too.”Indira Mukherjee, a CD Block resident and tutor of arts subjects, has to compete with TV stars to vie for her students’ attention. “What else to do if their grannies sit next to them watching Star Jalsha all evening?” she asks.Another English tutor from Salt Lake Sector I says she can hear a maths tutor teaching when her student “unmutes” herself to ask a question over Zoom. “Two sisters share the room at home and both have tuitions simultaneously. What can they to do?”Like work-from-home, study-from-home is the new normal. Living rooms have replaced classrooms, phones have replaced blackboards and teachers no longer shout: “Stop talking!” They now say: “Mute yourselves!” The world of teachers has undergone a sea change since the lockdown.

Speaking to a black screenThe most obvious problem is that of not being able to see the students. “It’s odd addressing a screen without faces. One can neither judge from their expressions nor hear their response. So sometimes I have to tell them to switch on their video and audio feed but when the microphones are on for too many students, it creates an echo,” complains Madhurima Sen, who teaches English at Bidhannagar Government High School.Then there is the deluge of scanned documents sent on her WhatsApp. “My phone is ready to crash every day as students send their home tasks,” adds Sen, a resident of CE Block.The appeal of chemistry is in watching the chemicals change colour, says Purnendu Chakraborty, chemistry teacher at StFrancis Xavier school. “Students used to wait for practical sessions. So now along with theory, I’m showing them YouTube videos of the reactions,” he says.Indira has a trying time teaching geography students maps and topography. “I’m sharing my screen and asking them to do as I do and to send me their scanned copies to check,” she says.Ditto with biology teacher Rima Mitra Ghosh, who used to draw diagrams extensively on the board. “I’m now drawing on a notebook and holding it up before the phone,” says the BK Block resident.Not to mention the strain teachers are undergoing. “My eyes start watering after reading the answers sent by students over WhatsApp. The glare is too much,” says Sagarika Ghosh of AC Block, who has retired from a school and now imparts tuition.Sumana Bagchi of BF Block is taking print-outs of her students’ answers, marking them with red ink pen and mailing them back. “I’m deducting marks for poor handwriting and encouraging them to send typed out answers as this is clearly the future,” says the English tutor.Perhaps no teachers have it tougher than those dealing with pre-school students, who refuse to sit still. “To teach A for apple, we are asking parents beforehand to hide an apple somewhere around the house and the kids are to go find that apple,” says Sneha Mukherjee of Little Laureates in Kestopur.“While the kids are happy at home now they may have separation anxiety once the lockdown is over. Maybe we’ll ask parents to sit outside class for a few days and reduce the duration of classes initially,” says Sneha.Eurokids in BB Block has been grooming tots for online admission tests into primary schools. “It’s not easy but we are using props, colourful videos, story-telling techniques. Initially the kids would eat or lie down during class but now they look forward to class, even asking to put on hairbands and deodorant,” says Soma Chandra.Then there is of course the ultimate challenge this season — Covid. “The mother of one of my students got infected while for another both his parents were infected. The situation was tough at home yet they tried their best to attend classes,” said a Bangur Avenue resident who teaches at a south Calcutta school.Mischief managedAs if technology wasn’t enough, teachers now have to deal with students determined to stir trouble even during online classes.Puloma Sen of Hariyana Vidya Mandir removes anyone chatting on the chatbox during class. “Remove” is the digital equivalent of asking a student to leave a classroom.Teachers mention how some students log in during roll call and then walk off, of how they share their screen, thereby distracting others. Mousumi once had to remove a Class X student who was being fed by her mother during class!“Another time I removed a primary school girl from yoga class as she would just not respond. She wouldn’t turn on her audio or video feed either. Later the child confessed she had dozed off on her yoga mat before class began,” laughed Mousumi.Madhurima says that while using the “white board” feature on Zoom once, a student scribbled and drew pictures on it while she spoke. “And it was not possible to make out who did it,” she says.

When parents attend classPompa Banerjee, a primary school teacher at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, has found parents prompting or even doing classwork for the kids. “It’s evident when I see the child looking around aimlessly. And when I ask to see his work he drags his copy from outside the frame and shows me,” says the GC Block resident. “I ask the parents to let the kids be independent.Bagchi knows of colleagues who have parents sitting in during class, as if testing the teachers. “It’s counter-productive,” she says.Mousumi talks about bare-chested, pot-bellied fathers, walking into the frame and pulling off underwear from clotheslines behind students. “In other homes, mothers shout at younger siblings while the elder one is attending class. Some dads have even tried to click photos of young teachers! Many parents are uncouth and it is they who need training before their kids,” the lady shakes her head.

Full attendanceIf there’s one upside to online classes it’s attendance. “Never before have I had 100 per cent attendance for such a long stretch of time. Noone is late for class and new students have joined from south and north Calcutta and even Mumbai for my English tuitions! One student was travelling during class one day and he attended the session sitting in his car,” says Sumana. The irony is that even Sumana, a BF Block resident, is in Delhi at the moment but most of her students don’t even know it. “While lazy students can while away their time on online classes, this is a fantastic set up for sincere students.”Puloma is delighted with attendance too. “I’ve even had ill students attending class lying in bed, dressed in uniform,” she says.Mousumi feels students who were timid in school have blossomed during online classes as they are in their own lair now.“They are more interactive, showing me their pets, plants, balconies and even baby brothers and sisters,” she says.
Honesty test“When students cheat in broad daylight under the noses of their teachers at school, how will we stop them from doing so in the sanctuary of their homes?” asks Sagarika, who feels open-book exams may be the only way out.  
Puloma has been holding oral tests for primary school kids, ensuring they look straight into the camera while answering and straining her ears to ensure there is no prompting from behind.When Purnendu sat to check online chemistry test papers he found the answers rather bookish. “They must have been Googled,” he says. “Henceforth I asked parents to invigilate during tests.”But Rahul Mojumder, primary school teacher of St. Francis Xavier School, has had unbelievable response. “I told the kids these questions were a test  of honesty. And I was overwhelmed to see many had left questions blank instead of copying them off. I praised their integrity and they loved it. Now when I mention their upcoming half-yearly exams, they tell me it’s not ‘half-yearly’ but ‘honesty’ exams,” he laughs.

Neither online nor offNetwork issues seem like First World problems compared to the hardships faced by certain students. “Parents of our students are coming to school once a month to pick up their mid-day meal ration of rice and lentils. It’s ridiculous to expect them to have smartphones,” says Bipasa Das Biswas, head teacher of Bidyadhari Vidyalaya in Duttabad.The school has been distributing worksheets to the parents when they come for rations but after Amphan many of families left for the Sundarbans to salvage what they could of their ancestral homes there. “When their roofs have blown away can we expect them to retain their homework?” asks the resident of Karunamoyee. “Besides, the chief minister has announced that this year all students will be promoted and so they are laid back.”Despite this order, Suparna Bose and other teachers of Krishnapur Chanchal Kumari Balika Vidyalay between Sector V and New Town, have been telling students they must hand in assignments to get promoted.

Why pay for online classWhile teachers felt appreciated when showered with cards and videos of songs and dances on Teachers’ Day last week, they have mixed feelings for parents.“Many parents have not paid me in months,” says Indira. “All my tutor friends are facing the same problem. I find it demeaning to ask payment for a vocation that is sacred to me but parents are taking advantage of the situation and simply ignoring the issue. It cannot be financial constraints either since these families are celebrating birthdays and anniversaries without a worry amidst lockdown.”Purnendu’s colleagues in other schools are suffering too. “Many parents feel fees are to be paid for sending children to school. They don’t regard online classes as education,” he says.This when the teachers say they are slogging harder than ever before. “It has taken hours of technical assistance and training sessions, topped with continuous pressure to prepare online teaching aids, an area of expertise we were expected to master overnight. We have been working 12 to 14 hours a day to help keep kids engaged,” says the teacher of Bangur Avenue.Suparna has been working as hard as she had to in the initial years of her career. “If it wasn’t hard enough teaching Anton Chekhov to first generation learners, I’m doing it over the phone now, sending them word meaning and notes over voice message. I’m calling each of my 52 students and urging them to do their assignments,” says the resident of Eastern High in New Town.“Some parents are claiming that since only one teacher teaches their child online they should not have to pay for the school’s operational costs. It’s painful,” says Soma of Eurokids.  Rima, however, feels for both sides. “I’m working very hard for the students but I wish I could do more. In school, I’d haul them up and discipline them for putting a toe out of line but now I can’t even see them. The students’ motivation and dedication have fallen and we have to push them harder than ever to work.”The Sector I tutor however shares how some of her colleagues are taking it easy now. “They are sending video links instead of slogging it out one-on-one, they are feigning network problems whenever it rains and cutting short their classes. It’s a sham!”The teacher from Bangur Avenue, who teaches in Class II, feels most classes are being held to justify salaries. “The children probably don’t need an online class or an online test as much as their teacher needs it to keep receiving his or her salary at the end of the month,” she says.",2020-11-09 18:23:00
1880,Snehal Sengupta,Covid transmission rate dips - Telegraph India,"There has been a major dip in the transmission rate of Covid-19 in areas falling under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, particularly in Salt Lake, health officials of the corporation are claiming.Transmission rate is the rate of increase of new Covid cases over a 14-day period.“The rate of transmission in Salt Lake, Teghoria, Baguiati and parts of Rajarhat was highest in the month of April,” said a health official. “It had peaked at 5.7 but since then the curve has flattened and there has been a decline in the curve of Covid transmission rate, especially in Salt Lake.”The reduced transmission rate, along with the dipping rate of active cases, shows a reverse of the trend prevailing in the rest of North 24-Parganas. The district has recorded more Covid cases than Calcutta in the later half of August.In May, the rate within the corporation area had dipped to 2.1 and then further to 1.2. In August, it had gone up to 1.7 but in September it has once again dipped to 1.4, the official added.Mayor Krishna Chakraborty said that a combined effort of raising awareness levels, constant disinfection drives and strict implementation of the total lockdowns, especially in Salt Lake, has resulted in the fall in the number of residents testing positive.“During Unlock-1, the cases rose as most people joined their workplaces or went to their businesses in crowded places like Burrabazar, that reported a high number of cases. But now, the figures are not rising drastically. People too have become more aware,” said Chakraborty.Residents, however, feel it’s too early to rejoice. “Only the other day, a neighbour tested positive,” said Preeti Agarwal, an FD Block resident.Buddhadeb Basu, a DB Block resident, said that a restaurant opposite their block had been shut for long as several of its employees had got Covid. “The restaurant has opened up now but new cases got reported in our block in August too,” said Basu.Deputy mayor infectedDeputy mayor of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Tapas Chatterjee tested positive earlier this week. Chatterjee had been organising Covid testing camps in Rajarhat and arranging for people to be sent to safe houses and quarantine centres. On Wednesday, he told The Telegraph Salt Lake that he was feeling better at a hospital off EM Bypass. ",2020-11-09 18:29:00
1881,Sudeshna Banerjee,"Woman delivers on road, treated and sent home - Telegraph India","A woman was reunited with her family over 60km away last Friday along with her newborn son after more than a fortnight of being adrift.On August 17 around 1am, the Techno City police station was alerted about a vagrant woman writhing in labour pain in front of a milk booth near Tata Memorial Center. When a team with a woman constable visited the spot, they found the woman had already delivered the baby which was still tied to her umbilical cord. She was also bleeding profusely.When an ambulance could not be arranged, the police flagged down a taxi and took her to Bidhannagar Subdivisional Hospital. “We arranged for the umbilical cord to be snapped but realised that she was suffering from puerperal psychosis (a mental health illness that can affect a woman soon after she has a baby). She could neither give her address nor was she willing to nurse the newborn. Other new mothers in the ward helped out but the milk was not enough. We had to make arrangements for food,” said Partha Pratim Guha, hospital superintendant.Things got further complicated when the baby developed jaundice two days later. By then, the mother had accepted the baby and refused to part with him. “We needed to give the baby phototherapy. My colleagues suggested referring him to another hospital. But I decided to keep him with us and manage the treatment.”Once the woman responded to treatment, she could give her address — a refugee colony under Basanti police station in South 24-Parganas. Police got in touch with the family but no one was coming to take her. “The family, we learnt, was too poor to hire a car and come all the way. So I arranged for an ambulance while Techno City police station inspector in charge Partha Sikdar provided an escort to take mother and child home.” The woman, identified as Abeda Sardar, was handed over to her parents.",2020-11-09 18:29:00
1882,Brinda Sarkar,Bee-keeping class in Eco Park - Telegraph India,"At a time when unemployment is on the rise, an initiative has been introduced in New Town to help people earn on the side.It has to do with rearing bees and will also help increase greenery.On September 4, residents of nearby villages had been invited to Eco Park to be familiarised with beekeeping. Arijit Das, an expert in the field, explained the stakes. “Besides honey, bees produce wax that has a huge demand in the pharmaceutical industry. It forms the base of medicines, moisturisers and lipsticks,” he said.Debashis Sen encouraged the villagers to seize the opportunity. Sen is chairman of New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) and chairman cum managing director of Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), that runs Eco Park. “We are not asking you to quit your day job but to add beekeeping to your portfolio for some additional income. You have an expert trainer for guidance and the whole project will be good for the environment.”The outreach programme is an initiative of Schoppen Solutions, of which Das is the founder. Last year, the bee corridor project had won a start-up contest and was incubated by Webel-BCC&I Tech Incubation Centre. Das then got a chance to build a prototype of his project at Eco Park, which was formally launched in March 2020, at the Banglar Gram enclosure.“Once you understand the basics, two hours of effort a day is enough to maintain bee colonies,” Das explained to the villagers. “But the most important factor is environment. Bees need lots of flowers nearby to suck nectar from. This is what they convert into honey and store in honeycombs that they create using beeswax. The excess honey is extracted by humans.”The villagers expressed curiosity about the project. “I don’t know anything about bees but I’m a farmer growing pumpkins, bitter gourd and jhinge in Rajarhat. If my neighbours start keeping bees I shall too,” said Sudhangsu Mondal.  Tapas Biswas may be a labourer but he grew up in the Sundarbans, a region renowned for honey. “My father would head to the forest to get honey. This is a lucrative profession and I might take it up,” he said.Das encouraged the individuals to form a self-help group. “If an entire neighbourhood joins the cause everyone will grow flowering plants for the bees. It will be more conducive than a single person growing plants on his terrace,” he explained.
Bees at homeDas has two separate designs of bee boxes for rural and urban folk.  While the former, explained above, is targeted at maximum honey production, the one for urban folk is more aesthetic and meant for self-consumption of honey.The box, to be launched later this month, can be mounted on a wall and has transparent exteriors for enthusiasts to watch the bees at work inside.“It is linked to an app that will inform the user whenever anything is amiss or give estimates about the production of honey,” says Das. It costs about Rs 5,000, including the app and some 1,500 bees. It should produce about 3l of honey a year,” says Das.  Any home in New Town or Salt Lake can practise apiculture successfully, provided there are flowers around — mustard, calendula, litchi, and mango are most suitable.As for the fear of stings, Das promised to teach handling bees in a way they do not find threatening. “Besides, bees die after stinging so they only sting as a last resort. They won’t harm you unless you’re out to destroy their colony,” he says. ",2020-11-09 19:53:00

1884,Sudeshna Banerjee,Artistes back on stage for Rabindra-Nazrul shows in New Town - Telegraph India,"There were barely 15 people off stage and they were all involved with the programme — be it as technician, as official or as participant waiting for his or her turn.This year, the death anniversary observations of Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam by Hidco in New Town were special for both the audience and the artistes. As is customary, Rabindra Tirtha hosted the former and Nazrul Tirtha hosted the latter programme. But the venues are where the similarity ended with what happens in other years.“We are used to celebrating every occasion. But this year, because of the total lockdown in April, we had to let Nava Varsha go by. Only artistes of Dakshinee recorded some performances from home for us which we posted online. On Tagore’s birth anniversary in May, the Hidco chairman and the Rabindra Tirtha curator spoke on stage and we repeated last year’s 25 Baisakh programme on our Facebook page. When things started opening up in the Unlock phase, we thought of holding programmes at the venue but of course without an audience. The programmes were recorded on stage a couple of days in advance and uploaded on the Facebook pages of the respective venues and on the WBHidco YouTube page,” said an official.The occasion turned out to be memorable for the artistes for it was the first time almost all of them were taking the stage in months. “We are born to the stage. We experience an adrenaline rush while stepping on one. While I was thrilled to get on a stage after four and a half months, I had mixed feelings about the experience as there was no audience,” recalled elocutionist Pranati Tagore, who had a special word for the way the stage was beautifully decorated.The scent of tuberoses and jasmine is what struck another elocutionist, Shovansundar Bosu, as he took his place next to musicians in masks. He savoured the feeling of being part of a concert so much that even after recording was over for his performance, he stayed back till the end to watch others. “We were all in a relaxed mood which is never the case as we are always rushing to finish off and head for the next show during peak season,” said the Kestopur resident. Seeing Pranati Tagore wait as he took the stage, he asked her if she wanted to perform ahead of him. “She smilingly asked me to carry on.”Pranati smiled wistfully at the mention of how such days would be spent in other years. “Baishe Sravan would start early in the morning with a programme at Nimtala Ghat, where Kaviguru was cremated. About eight to nine shows would be lined up for the rest of the day,” she recalled, adding that she was not thinking of taking part in live concerts with audience any time soon, even if such gatherings were allowed.All the artistes rued the lack of audience reaction. “After a song, you can make out if the audience liked it. Here there was no one to react. It was a strange test to get used to,” said Prabuddha Raha, who has gone online with his weekly classes that took place in DB and CK blocks.Iman Chakraborty, whose performance opened the online show, felt the experience was more like a studio shoot. “But it felt great to sit on a stage after months. My last show before this was on March 10.” So excited was she to meet other performers that on seeing Srikanta Acharya, she took out her sanitiser bottle, applied some to her palm and extended her arm for a handshake. “He also did the same. We did that in jest to accept the new normal,” said Iman.Nazrul’s 44th death anniversary on August 29 also went the online way, with performances of four artistes from Chhayanat being recorded at Nazrul Tirtha the day before. “We deal round the year with Kazi Nazrul Islam’s work. We had prepared a documentary film titled Nazruler Churulia, by visiting the poet’s birthplace near Asansol and interviewing his nephew Rezaul Karim, the current president of Nazrul Academy, which is located where his house stood. It was to have been screened at Nazrul Tirtha on this occasion but that was cancelled in this pandemic situation,” said Somerita Mallik, president of Chhayanat.Speaking at the Baishey Srabon show, Hidco chairman Debashis Sen said though conventional concerts could not be held, the “online window has opened”. “We are getting an opportunity to reach our programme across the world,” he said, welcoming the artistes who “have conquered fear to come and perform” at Rabindra Tirtha, which he described as the “Santiniketan of Calcutta”.The two programmes can still be viewed on the WBHidco YouTube page.",2020-11-09 20:09:00

Indian Psychiatric Society and Kshema Trust, Shimoga, Karnataka, has launched an essay competition on “Minding our minds during the lockdown” for students of classes VIII to XII. “Students are stuck at home. This can have an impact on them and writing about it might help express their anxieties and fears,” said Gautam Saha, vice-president-cum-president (elect) of Indian Psychiatric Society. “In counselling, we often use creative tools such as painting or writing to bring out what is in the unconscious mind.

1887,A Staff Reporter,Coronavirus Lockdown: Calcutta puja committee turns lockdown Samaritan - Telegraph India,"A puja committee in Salt Lake has started distributing a week’s ration to the needy and senior citizens who live alone in the township.A majority of the beneficiaries are rickshaw-pullers, sweepers, labourers and cooks and workers of fast-food outlets that are closed because of the lockdown.The ED Block Abashikbrindo puja committee has raised funds from residents over the past several days and started distributing food on Sunday.The committee is not only raising funds to buy food but is also using it to buy clothes for distribution among underprivileged children during Durga Puja, Ranjan Poddar, a member of the puja committee, said.“The lockdown has hit the poor the hardest. Most are running terribly short of funds… we were thinking of ways to help them when a member came up with the idea,” Poddar said.The committee created a WhatsApp group of residents and appealed for help. Several residents responded — some donated money while many gave bags of rice, pulses and cereals, he said.The committee has formed a group of volunteers, some of whom are going around the block distributing the packets. Each packet contains 2kg each of rice and potato, 1kg onion, 1kg daal, and a 500gm bottle of cooking oil, Poddar said.The volunteers have done a detailed profiling of those in need of help in adjoining blocks and come up with a list of close to 1,000 men and women.The committee has also been distributing packets of food among several elderly residents who live alone and find it difficult to go to the market for essential items, another member said.“There are many elderly couples in our block whose children are working outside the state. We have been giving them these packets. Many are reluctant to accept, though, and some have even offered us money,” the member said.Till late on Sunday, the committee had distributed food packets among more than 200 people while following social distancing norms, Poddar said.Several other puja committees in the township are thinking of distributing food to the needy.Banibrata Banerjee, a member of the FD Block puja committee, said a videoconference had been planned to discuss how to go about the matter.Rudradeb Mukherjee, a member of the EC Block puja committee, said members had held a teleconference to discuss how to distribute free ration among rickshaw-pullers, labourers and sweepers in the block.“These people have lost their livelihood and we need to do everything we can to help them tide over this crisis,' Mukherjee said.",2020-12-04 20:06:00
1888,Snehal Sengupta,Coronavirus Lockdown: Vets on call for sick pets in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Pet parents worried about medical care during the lockdown can call for an ambulance or a vet through a helpline launched by the government and Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation.Residents across the city can dial 9604010035 for pet-related  emergencies, an official of the Salt Lake civic body said. People can also use the helpline to get help for wounded or ill stray animals, the official said.The 24X7 helpline will have qualified vets on call.At least two vehicles have been earmarked as animal ambulances. They are connected with communication systems to respond to distress calls on the helpline, the official said. The animal ambulances will have people trained in handling animals apart from vets.The team will try to prescribe and administer medicines on the spot and, if needed, transport an animal to a veterinary hospital, the official said. The focus will be on treating animals on the spot, the official said.The initiative was taken keeping in mind that several animal clinics and pet stores with attending doctors are shut because of the lockdown, Krishna Chakraborty, the Bidhannagar mayor, said.  “We started this keeping in mind that there are hundreds of Calcuttans who have pets at home. We had received several calls from residents seeking help for their sick pets,” she said.Apart from requesting an ambulance, people can seek advice over the helpline, Chakraborty said.",2020-12-04 20:06:00
1889,Chandreyee Ghose,Ration and help for transgender people in Calcutta - Telegraph India,"Fifty members  of the transgender community  collected dry ration on Friday as part of an initiative to help them during the lockdown.The members from across south Calcutta came to Amra Odbhut Cafe — an eatery run by the queer community — in 12 batches to maintain physical distance.  A similar drive is scheduled for the community members in north Calcutta next week.NGO Amitie Trust drew up a list of around 375 members of the transgender community in the state and shared it. “We handed the list to (minister) Shashi Panja,” said Aparna Banerjee of the NGO and a former member of the Transgender Development Board. A majority of the 4,000-5,000 trans-community members in the city works as sex workers or earn by visiting homes after childbirth.  “Many of them have no bank accounts. The prospect of losing out on livelihood for months has left them on the brink of a mental breakdown,” Banerjee said.On Day I of the distribution, 50 transgender persons were given 5kg rice, 1kg dal, potatoes, soap, cooking oil, biscuits and spices each. “It is enough to last at least two weeks. Most live in clusters with community members so they can share resources,” Banerjee said.Panja, the minister of state for women and child development and social welfare, was part of the  ration distribution. “We were asked by the chief minister to help the distressed,” she said.Minister of state for health and family welfare Chandrima Bhattacharya, who was also at the programme, said: “We will continue the drive as long as required.”The members of the transgender community are also being given free mental health counselling and doctor’s advice over the phone. “Many of them require  hormonal treatment. Their health issues are getting neglected. So a Hooghly-based unit, Samarth Community Clinic, is offering advice over phone. We are also trying to educate our community members on how to take precautions in future through WhatsApp messages,” Banerjee said.",2020-12-04 20:06:00
1890,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus Lockdown: Kids log on for play dates and birthday parties - Telegraph India,"A five-year-old dressed up as a vampire stood in front of a laptop screen. On the other side was her friend in another part of the town dressed as a fairy. The two girls were pretend playing.In another home, a six- year-old sat in front of a computer, jotting down a new word she had just heard as her grandmother narrated a story from her home.The play dates in game zones and at parks have gone online during the lockdown. Technology has been a saviour in many homes as children remain cooped up, unable to go even next door, and parents looking for ways to keep them engaged.When a three-year-old said she missed playing with her friends in the same building or going out with her grandfather every evening, her mother set up a video call over WhatsApp and the two friends played with their favourite doctor set. “Children are missing their friends and play dates are a complete no. Now is the time to let children use virtual play. Parents can help them connect with friends online through video calls or group calls,” said Suman Sood, director, BD Memorial, and mentor of the Calcutta, Odisha and Kerala territories of Early Childhood Association, a forum of preschools.Sood suggested that play dates could be set up through apps where children could play board games and take turns virtually on the board, read aloud together or create art together. “They will make up their own games, share experiences, laugh and play together,” she said. Parents are also hosting virtual birthday parties to beat the lockdown blues. “We could not host a party because of the lockdown but when it was time for my two-year-old daughter to cut the cake, we connected online with some of her older cousins and it made all the kids happy and stay connected,” said T. Dasgupta, who stays in Salt Lake.But it’s not all play and no work for the kids. Some schools are sending out material to parents to keep the little ones occupied. Bubble Blue Montessori, which has seven schools, will have a storytelling session for children once or twice a week. “We have spun small stories around vegetable or fruit vendors and those who are collecting garbage and how they are coming to work and making it easier for us while we stay at home,” said principal Nabonita Bose Mukherjee. Bose Mukherjee has also shared some tips with parents to keep their children occupied while they work from home and simultaneously set boundaries with children.“All parents do not have a designated office space while working from home and so setting clear boundaries with children can help. A parent can have a thumbs up, thumbs down or whatever works as a signal when one cannot  be disturbed. In most homes it is double the work and one has to set a routine,” Bose Mukherjee said.Some preschools feel it is important  for children to be connected with their teachers and friends during the lockdown. Leap Years preschool in Bhowanipore is setting up a meeting with children aged two to four once a day for half an hour. The kids interact with friends and teachers and also say rhymes. “It is important to stay connected with their teachers and friends because once the lockdown is over there is a possibility of separation anxiety and it might mean starting all over again with the children,” said Pooja Dugar, director of the school.",2020-12-04 20:08:00
1891,Our Special Correspondent,Rain and hail in north Calcutta - Telegraph India,"A brief but sharp spell of rain, accompanied by hailstorm in a few places, came down in the city’s northern parts and fringes on Sunday evening. A local cluster of tall thunderclouds, “shell” in meteorological parlance, over the city brought the showers, a Met official said. Cossipore and Ultadanga received around 4mm of rain, according to the pumping stations of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Shyambazar experienced a spell of hailstorm around 5.30pm. “A white sheet covered the empty roads in minutes,” a resident of the area said.Netizens were quick to attribute the hailstorm to the “reduced pollution and cleansing of nature” because of the lockdown. But the Met office was not so certain. The formation of hail could be because of the larger-than-usual volume of thunderclouds that, in places, touched the freezing troposphere, a weather official said. In some parts of the city, the cloud columns were over 12km high from the surface, he said.“The rain-bearing clouds were formed because of overheating and moisture incursion from Bay of Bengal. There is a cyclonic circulation off the Bangladesh coast,” he added. “The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 36 degrees over the next two days,” said G.K. Das, director of the India Meteorological Centre, Calcutta.",2020-12-04 20:08:00
1892,Our Special Correspondent,"Coronavirus Lockdown: Be firm but polite, Anuj Sharma tells team - Telegraph India","Calcutta police commissioner Anuj Sharma has asked officers to be “very firm but polite” with citizens to ensure they stay indoors during the lockdown, police said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had on Saturday announced an extension of the lockdown till April 30.Drones will be used to keep a bird’s-eye view on densely populated areas in the city to ensure social distancing rules are followed, the police said on Sunday. Drones will act as a “deterrent” to lockdown violators, Sharma is learnt to have said.“We should strictly maintain lockdown in all areas, especially in places that have reported positive cases. Unnecessary movement of people and vehicles should not be allowed,” an officer quoted the commissioner as saying.“But access to essential commodities by the general public is to be ensured. OCs should facilitate home delivery of essential goods and medicines… that  will ensure people do not leave their homes unnecessarily.”The officer said: “We were told to be very firm but polite. Unnecessary harassment of public has to be avoided.”There have been several complaints across the state of police excesses on people who had stepped out of their homes to buy medicines or essential supplies. The police have been accused of stopping essential service providers from joining duty.At least 12 cops in the Bengal police’s jurisdiction have been “closed” (a type of punishment) and departmental proceedings initiated against four of them.There has been no such allegation in the city police’s area but it is the duty of the force to maintain restraint despite being firm on lockdown rules, a city police officer said. City cops have been prosecuting people who fail to justify why they stepped out of their homes. The officer, however, said the biggest challenge lay in controlling people’s movement in lanes.The drones are expected to play a vital role in monitoring densely populated pockets. There have been instances of residents of such pockets stepping out of their homes the moment a police patrol leaves the place.“We can prevent such situations by keeping a close watch with the help of drones. The live feed will be monitored at Lalbazar. The moment such a thing is seen, the nearest police patrol will be sent to the spot,” an officer in Lalbazar said. “People will have a fair idea that we can see them even when they cannot see us.”On Sunday evening, cops on loudhailers asked residents of housing complexes along the Bypass not to loiter on the campus.“We have been getting reports that residents of housing complexes have been stepping out of their homes. They are loitering on the complex premises without any restrictions,” an officer in Lalbazar said.The number of checkpoints on roads will be increased in the next phase of the lockdown to ensure stricter prosecution of violators, the officer said.",2020-12-04 20:08:00
1893,Subhajoy Roy,"Coronavirus pandemic: Door-to-door check on in Calcutta, long way to go - Telegraph India","Corporation officials are going door to door to seek out people with symptoms of Covid-19.Nearly 1 lakh homes in the city have been covered since the door-to-door surveillance began on Thursday, corporation officials said.The first round of surveillance is expected to  be wrapped up in about 20 days, followed by a second round.Some officials are, however, worried about the 20-day gap between the two visits since the incubation period or the duration within which symptoms of Covid-19 emerge is 14 days. Shortage of manpower makes it impossible to increase the frequency of visits, they said.The corporation team, will, however, not visit apartments. The civic body has requested the residents’ associations of gated communities to complete the survey on their behalf. The surveillance work is being carried out by 600 honorary health workers engaged by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s (CMC) health department. Each of the 144 wards in the city has four to five such health workers. “We have asked each honorary health worker to visit 50 homes a day. It is not possible for one person to cover more,” the official said. The health workers have been asked to take down details of all residents of a home and also ask if they had any symptoms of Covid-19 — fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If a health worker comes across an individual suffering from fever or other Covid-19 symptoms, the surveillance in the immediate neighbourhood will be intensified and the focus will be on finding out if  anyone else in the locality is suffering from fever or other symptoms.“The time taken to complete the first round of home surveillance would vary. In a ward with fewer people and lesser expanse, it may be completed in eight to nine days. But in larger wards with more people, the first round may take 17-18 days or even more,” a doctor in charge of surveillance in a CMC borough said. Several residents of Kasba and Behala told Metro civic officials had not yet visited their homes. A public health specialist praised the initiative but added that health workers should communicate with all residents clearly on the first visit itself so that there is no need for a second visit. “While the effort to go to each home in Calcutta is a good one, why is the civic body even thinking about a second visit?” asked Shahid Jameel, the CEO of The Wellcome Trust-DBT India Alliance. “The personnel visiting homes should speak a language people understand. They should be clearly instructed to remain patient and answer all questions of the residents. The corporation must own people’s trust. It is then that people will themselves report in case they develop any symptom. The communication from the civic body should make it clear where to inform and when,” Jameel said.India Alliance works in biomedical, clinical and public health research and is funded by the Centre’s department of biotechnology and the Wellcome Trust of the UK.The civic body’s health department also has 3,000 field workers who are part of the efforts to prevent vector-borne diseases. “We are mulling whether we can use their services as well. Then the work would become easier. But since dengue prevention work has also begun, we have to see how much their services can be used,” the official said. There are also 1,400 civic personnel engaged in work related to information, education and communication on various diseases. But training them immediately to collect health data during door-to-door surveillance may not be easy, civic sources said. Civic doctors were asked to intensify the surveillance at a meeting with state officials and local representatives of WHO on Tuesday. “Community surveillance will help in early detection and isolation and thus prevent the spread,” said a public health specialist.",2020-12-04 20:08:00
1894,Sanjay Mandal,Fear the biggest block in coronavirus fight in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Reluctance to report to doctors primary symptoms of Covid-19 because of apprehensions of getting quarantined and fear of being ostracised are two major challenges in the state’s battle against the coronavirus, senior health officials have said. The government is also worried about the alleged fear of the disease among some healthcare providers, including doctors, as it could seriously affect treatment of coronavirus patients if a large number of people start getting admitted to hospitals.“We have evidence of many people, especially in rural areas, not visiting the fever clinics at government hospitals even though they have fever, cough or cold. This makes early detection difficult,” a senior health official said on Sunday. “If we can identify patients when they are manifesting mild symptoms, then the management of the disease becomes easier. Also it may help check the spread of the disease,” he said.The Telegraph takes a look at the challenges:Fear of quarantine: Many people are scared of being sent to quarantine centres, public health experts said.“They are afraid of leaving their own homes and staying in an unfamiliar place. Also, they are scared of possible medical interventions. A large section of the population needs to be made aware that quarantine centres are not prions,” said a public health expert working with the state government.Fear of ostracisation: Another fear is social stigma. Across India, there have been reports of neighbours not allowing health workers and suspected coronavirus patients to stay in their localities. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has also appealed several times to people not to ostracise anyone with coronavirus symptoms or those treating such patients.The problem is more acute in the suburbs and rural areas, videoconferences with district administrations and health officials and visits by members of the health task force formed by chief minister Mamata Banerjee have revealed.“We were trying to track down the contacts of a person who had tested positive for Covid-19. After about four days, we traced one person who had come in direct contact with that patient. We found a family member of this contact had been suffering from fever for three days but she had not gone to the hospital. Instead, she was getting treated by a quack,” said a health official.Accredited social health activists (ASHA) and auxiliary nurse midwifery (ANM) workers have been put on surveillance duty in the districts. For every 1,000 people, there is one ASHA worker and  for every 5,000-6,000 people, there is one ANM worker, health officials said. “So, it’s not practically possible to check the temperature of each and every person. The ASHA and ANM workers can only ask if anyone in the house has fever,” a health official said. Another problem, he said, was that an ASHA worker can visit a household once a week. If the day after the visit, someone has fever, then he or she needs to report it.Fear among health workers: A large section of health workers, including doctors, are afraid of being infected and also wary of social stigma.“We received reports that health workers at a Covid-19 designated hospital in Calcutta were just placing food from a distance for patients in isolation. This makes a patient feel completely left out by society,” said an official. A crucial part of coronavirus treatment is checking the vital parameters of a patient. “If doctors and nurses are reluctant to go near a patient, surveillance will not be proper,” said the official. “Reports of doctors and nurses getting affected has also spread panic. But we are motivating them.”",2020-12-04 20:09:00
1895,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus Lockdown: Trucks to enter fruit hub of Kolkata for a short while - Telegraph India,"Trucks from other states will be allowed to enter Mechhua fruit market as usual but would be expected to leave immediately after unloading.Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, said on Tuesday that fruit traders have been asked to ensure that the drivers and helpers of the trucks do not step out of the vehicle and roam around the market when the fruits are unloaded. This will minimise their contact with local traders and their staff.The same rule would apply to other wholesale markets in Burrabazar such as Posta and Dalpatti, he said.The Jorasanko and Burrabazar areas have reported several cases of Covid-19. Civic doctors suspect that those carrying fruits in trucks could have spread the disease while interacting with local traders in Mechhua. Traders had said on Monday that they had been asked to collect fruits coming from outside the state at Kona truck terminal as the trucks would not be allowed to enter Mechhua.“The fruit traders do not want to go all the way to Kona to collect consignments. So we told them to ensure that the trucks leave within two-three hours of their arrival. The trucks should not stay back in the market for long,” Hakim told The Telegraph.The traders met Hakim at the civic headquarters on Tuesday. “We will meet all traders on Wednesday and tell everyone what Hakim told us and what we have promised the corporation. Hakim also promised us that the police will help us rein in rulebreakers,” said Mohammad Iftakhar Alam, the secretary of the Calcutta Fruit Merchants’ Association.",2020-12-05 21:07:00
1897,Anasuya Basu,Coronavirus: Post-lockdown tips to beat car blues - Telegraph India,"As parts of the city prepares to get back to work, albeit in a graded manner, many of the parked vehicles in garages and underground parkings will not really spring back to life at the touch of ignition.With lockdowns having been enforced for nearly two months, many of the private vehicles had been parked for that many days without any maintenance. The first casualty of such prolonged non-use is the battery. Most city dealerships are preparing to stock up spare batteries as they feel there will be a deluge of calls complaining of “dead batteries or partially discharged batteries”.“The vehicle will not start when the ignition is turned on. If the engine does not make a sound at all… the best thing will be to call up the workshop or the battery company,” said a workshop mechanic. “We will send a spare battery to our customers and bring the dead battery back for recharging. Or, we can also send jumper cables to start the car,” said a spokesperson for a Honda dealership in the city.Explaining what causes the battery to die over prolonged non-use, the mechanic said: “A fully charged battery has lead plates suspended in a solution of water and sulphuric acid. As the battery discharges, sulphur is drawn out of the battery acid and the lead plates become coated in lead sulfate. This is a reversible process. When you connect a charger to a battery or when the alternator provides current to it when the engine is running, most of the lead sulfate coating on the lead plates return to the liquid electrolyte.”While the process is reversible, the number of charge and discharge cycles is limited. “So you may find that a battery that has been jump-started or charged from dead more than a handful of times will have to be replaced anyway,” said the mechanic.For hybrid cars, which have two batteries in the vehicle — auxiliary and hybrid — it is the auxiliary one, which starts the engine, that can drain out if not in use for a prolonged period, said Topsel Toyota service manager Subhashish Ganguly. The other issue with cars that have not been in use will be the wheels. Jammed wheels are a common problem with stalled cars. However, jammed wheels can be fixed by sudden release of clutch and driving the car with force. “If that doesn’t help, the workshop needs to be alerted,” said the mechanic.“We are keeping a team ready to attend to such service calls from customers. We are going to provide on-site service. Even if the lockdown is lifted, we may not be able to operate the workshop in full because of norms of social distancing,” said Neelmani Sharma of the sole Mercedes dealership in the city, Benchmark Interkrafts.",2020-12-05 21:21:00
1898,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus Lockdown: Testing time for small traders across Kolkata in what was peak season - Telegraph India,"Mohammad Johar Ali would sell garments during Ramazan every year.The money Johar earned, along with a friend, from a makeshift stall they put up on Market Street was enough for the family’s Id shopping.Ali, who works in a garments store, would take leave to set up shop as it would fetch him more than his monthly salary.This Ramazan, Ali remains locked up at home. Market Street, which would be buzzing with shoppers in other years, lies silent.Ali is not even thinking of buying new clothes, he is worried how to feed his family. “I know I will not be able to buy new clothes. We  need to eat first,” he said.Mohammad Bilal Khan, a fruit trader at Mechhua, sold 10 tonnes of apples every day during Ramazan last year. This year, he has been able to sell 20 tonnes in a week. A well-to-do wholesaler, Khan said he would manage with his savings but is not so sure about the hundreds of small retailers who buy from him. The lockdown has robbed several small traders and day labourers of the opportunity of earning anything during Ramazan, considered peak season. Community elders say there is a frustration, especially among the poor. “This is the time when the very poor sell odd things and make money. Besides, there are many small and medium-sized shops for whom the Ramazan month sales account for nearly half the year,” said one of them.Zakaria Street, Colootala Street and the entire Chitpore area would be teeming with buyers and sellers every Ramazan. But the shopping centre is now shut. So is New Market.Hundreds of small traders set up shop on Zakaria Street and Colootala Street every Ramazan, selling everything from fried items, sewai, fruits and dates to jewellery and clothes and sundry other things. Most of these traders do not have permanent shops.A community elder said many of these people are now completely dependent on food being provided by the government or help from NGOs or benevolent individuals. Maidul Islam, an assistant professor at the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences in Patuli, said the immediate impact is on small seasonal traders who used to sell dates, fruits or delicacies. As the shopping centre in Chitpore is closed, these small traders have not been able to put up stalls. “Fruits and dates are consumed while breaking fast. These businesses were the first to be hit. As the month progressed, the garment shops started feeling the pinch,” said Islam. “The buying of new clothes usually starts about a fortnight before Id.” The impact is also telling on hotels that dot the New Market area. They have lost out on the stream of Bangladeshis, who come to the city every year to shop during Ramazan. “The Bangladeshis come before Id and shop. And they come for vacation in large numbers after Id, stay in hotels in New Market and buy clothes and jewellery. That seems impossible this year,” said Taher Faizullahbhoy, a member of the Oriental Chamber of Commerce.The food stalls at Chitpore that sell delicacies like haleem only at this time of the year have not been set up this time. The majestic Nakhoda Masjid, in the heart of Chitpore, would receive faithfuls from near and far. This year, the mosque doors are shut. A member of its governing body said the prayers are read aloud on loudspeakers. “Every year we would announce the time of the next prayer at regular intervals so that people could join the prayers. This year, we have stopped announcements to prevent anyone from coming to the mosque,” he said. Only the mosque staff are praying inside.Maulana Mohammad Shafique, one of the imams of Nakhoda Masjid, said people have been asked to maintain distance during Friday prayers. “We are asking everyone to follow the rules set by the government, asking them not to congregate anywhere,” he said. Shafique urged everyone to feed and clothe the needy near their homes. Across the city, the picture is the same. In Kidderpore, too, the small garment stores spring up at this time of the year are absent. Shaikh Sohail, a resident of Kidderpore, said he would buy haleem once or twice a month for his family from local stores. “There is a store outside Fancy Market that makes very good haleem. I bought from them frequently. The big names may be selling haleem through delivery platforms but it is these small but good stores that are suffering,” he said. The lockdown has also had its impact on zakat or the act of charity. Abdul Quadir, who runs a jewellery business in the Canning Street area, said the beneficiaries usually include madarsas in rural areas. The caretakers of the madarsas come to cities to collect donations during Ramazan. Zakat is usually calculated as 2.5 per cent of one’s liquid assets. That amount of money is used for charity, said Quadir. “Because of the lockdown, maulanas and caretakers of madarsas are not able to come. Some of the bigger and established ones might get money via electronic transfers but a majority of them depend on small cash donations from individuals. They have to wait till the lockdown is lifted to be able to come,” said Quadir. No business for almost two months and an uncertain future has meant that other donations have also been impacted. “If someone donated Rs 10,000 earlier because of good business, this year the person would donate less because there is no guarantee when businesses would resume,” said an elderly community member.",2020-12-05 21:32:00
1899,Pranesh Sarkar,Red zone to be split and eased: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on coronavirus lockdown - Telegraph India,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said her government would allow some activities in Covid red zones by splitting such districts into three zones  as the state wanted to strike a balance between life and livelihood.“Red zones will be divided into three categories — A, B and C. The police would finalise the divisions and submit a report by May 15. Once we receive the report, we will take decisions,” the chief minister told a news conference at Nabanna.The relaxations are scheduled to come into force from May 21.In Red Zone A, nothing will be allowed. In Red Zone B, activities which would not aggravate the situation will be allowed. Social distancing and other protocols would be mandatory at the facilities that would be allowed to operate in the areas, said the chief minister.“In Red Zone C, which is outside the containment zones and outside the barricade, some activities will be allowed,” Mamata said.Ten Bengal districts — Calcutta, Howrah, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, West Midnapore, East Midnapore, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Malda — currently fall in the red zone categorised by the Centre.Restaurants — confined to takeaway services —  jewellery stores and film-related technical functions might be allowed in the red zones.The chief minister said the relaxations in the red zones would be allowed after ensuring that they would not aggravate the situation in the sensitive areas.On April 27, Mamata had said her government was preparing a plan to continue with “special measures” in the containment zones till May 21.Although the chief minister did not specify the criteria for  each segment in the red zones, government officials said that would depend on the number of Covid-19 positive cases reported from a particular area.“If positive cases are being reported on a regular basis from a containment zone, it would fall in the A category. If a containment zone does not report any positive case for a certain period, say two weeks, it would fall in the B category. The rest of the district would fall in the C category,” said an official.“It has been noticed that the majority of the positive cases are being reported from containment zones already identified. If some activities are allowed outside the areas, it would help people earn their livelihood,” said an official.Mamata explained why she was set to take such a decision.“Corona was there, it is there and it will be there. The Prime Minister also said yesterday that we would not get rid of this quickly. In the coming days we have to work with Corona. It does not seem that it would go away right now,” said the chief minister.The chief minister said restaurants could be allowed to run takeaway services in red zones, in addition to establishments like jewellery shops. The facilities could be allowed to operate between 12 noon and 6pm.Some other activities, she said, like editing, dubbing and mixing for film and television activities could be allowed. Activities in the ports could also be allowed, she said.“Nothing is finalised. Everything would be finalised once the police submit their report. The chief minister outlined some activities that could be allowed as social distancing and other Covid-19 protocols could be maintained in the facilities,” said an official.The state government has already allowed standalone shops across the state that sell electrical goods, mobile phones, paint, hardware and other non-essential items to function.",2020-12-05 21:35:00
1900,Kinsuk Basu,Coronavirus pandemic: Protocol to rationalise PPE use by state government - Telegraph India,"The state government has prepared a protocol on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by doctors, nurses and other personnel working in hospitals.Health department officials said the protocol was prepared after protests by doctors and healthcare workers who alleged shortage of protective gear and also overuse of PPE.The protocol elaborates who all in a hospital should wear full-set PPE, who can do with only gloves and N-95 masks and who should have their faces covered with a triple-layer medical mask. The directives have been listed in “Management Protocol for Covid-19”, where different categories of healthcare workers and other employees of hospitals have been identified along with their risk levels. The protocol also contained a detailed directive on the right technique of wearing and taking off the PPE. According to the protocol, doctors, nurses and technicians working in pathological laboratories will have to wear full-set PPE, including a head cover, shoe covers, an N-95 mask, gloves, a clean non-sterile cover-all and a long-sleeve gown.The protocol states that persons operating lifts carrying patients and sanitary staff need not wear full PPE gear. They will only have to wear N-95 masks and gloves. Doctors and nurses attending to patients with severe acute respiratory infection will have to wear full PPE. Same for doctors, nurses and technicians in critical care units.For outpatient departments, the protocol says doctors, nurses and technicians will only have to wear N-95 masks and gloves. OPD patients and relatives will have to wear “triple-layer medical mask”.Healthcare workers handling bodies in mortuaries will have to wear N-95 masks and gloves.The health department has also issued a set of advisories to private hospitals spelling out that only patients from red zones will have to undergo a Covid-19 test for planned surgeries. Health officials said the advisory was issued because many patients' relatives were alleging that despite testing negative for Covid-19, healthcare workers were wearing PPE while attending to such patients, leading to a spike in expenses. The new management protocol will help rationalise the use of PPE around a time when there is shortage of these equipment not just in Bengal but across the country, health officials said.Many, including doctors, have been making social media posts about the alleged shortage of PPE in Bengal.  Over the past few weeks, several doctors, nurses, technicians and other healthcare workers have tested positive for Covid-19, disrupting services at many medical colleges and hospitals. Doctors and other healthcare workers have alleged that lack of protective gear was responsible for so many of them getting infected with the novel coronavirus. “The protocol is clear. A doctor treating a patient without severe acute respiratory infection at the emergency ward will not have to wear a full-set PPE,” said an official of the health department. “But if he has to see a patient with the infection (severe acute respiratory infection), he will have to use a full PPE.” Health department officials expressed the hope that the directive issued to private hospitals would prompt them to refrain from overcharging patients for PPE.",2020-12-05 21:56:00
1901,Mita Mukherjee,Coronavirus Lockdown: Tech final exam to be computer-based in Bengal - Telegraph India,"Private engineering colleges in Bengal will have the undergraduate final semester exams through a computer-based process to avoid answer scripts and question papers.Students will have to go to their colleges and use the computer laboratories to write the exams on computers.The Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology is developing a software for colleges to conduct the exams. The university will install the software in the computers of its 200-odd colleges.The new computer-based exam system will expedite the process of evaluation, the university has said.“The university will take less time to prepare the results as well,” vice-chancellor Saikat Maitra said. Close to 30,000 students  are slated to take the undergraduate final semester exams.The exams will be held a month after colleges reopen. As of now all educational institutions in the state are closed till June 10.The university decided not to conduct the exams through a centralised online system to avoid disruption because of connectivity problems.Some of the colleges are in the districts where Net connectivity is poor.",2020-12-05 22:11:00
1903,Subhajoy Roy,Coronavirus pandemic: Sample collection goes mobile in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Mobile swab sample collection started in Calcutta on Tuesday. A retrofitted ambulance collected samples in the Chetla and New Alipore areas, Calcutta Municipal Corporation officials have said.The move is aimed at going deep inside a place to collect samples and reduce the time gap between identifying a  Covid-19 suspect and testing his/her swab sample, a CMC official said.“This will help us isolate a positive patient quickly and contain the spread,” a CMC doctor said.Public health professionals have said more tests are needed to identify Covid-19 positive people and then isolate them to prevent the spread of the infection.Many people who were asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of Covid-19 are reluctant to visit hospitals to get their swab samples tested, another CMC official said.CMC doctors give referral slips to those identified as contacts of Covid-19 positive people or those with symptoms to visit a hospital and get themselves checked. Tests can be done only if prescribed by a doctor .On Tuesday, the sample collection started near Durgapur bridge in Chetla and continued in two other locations. All three locations are part of Ward 82, from where Firhad Hakim has been elected as a councillor.“The vehicle collected swab samples near Durgapur bridge, on Rakhal Auddy Road and on Alipore Road,” Ratan Malakar, the former chairman of CMC’s Borough IX, said.Five more vehicles will be retrofitted by this week to turn them into mobile swab sample collection centres, a CMC official said.“We conducted over 400 tests on Tuesday. If the state health department wants, we can scale up the number of tests. We are training medical technologists in sample collection,” the official said.",2020-12-05 22:19:00

1906,Subhankar Chowdhury,Coronavirus lockdown: IIT Kharagpur asks students to vacate hostels by June 20 - Telegraph India,"IIT Kharagpur has asked its students to vacate their hostels by June 20 as the mess staff and ward boys who had been working without a break through the lockdown want to go home, said an official of the institute.More than 3,000 students are now on the campus as the institute — unlike IISc, IIEST and some NITs — did not ask them to move out before the lockdown was imposed.The order to vacate the hostels comes at a time institutes like IISc have asked their students to return to the campus. IISER, Kalyani, is working on a plan to bring students back.An IIT Kharagpur teacher said the authorities had failed to foresee the magnitude of the problem and was now asking the students to go home at a time “the outbreak appears to be peaking”.“Besides, means of transport are inadequate now. Normal train services have not yet resumed. So, the students either have to travel on buses or hire cabs,” said the teacher.A student said they had been petitioning the hostel superintendents to let them go home before the start of the lockdown, but their pleas were allegedly turned down.“When the other IITs, such as the ones in Kanpur and Guwahati, were vacating their hostels in March, we had requested the authorities that we be allowed to go home. At that time there were a few Covid cases. But our pleas were declined. Now, I wonder how people in my neighbourhood would react after knowing that I have travelled a long distance to reach home at a time the pandemic is raging. Would they accept me easily?” asked a PhD student.An MTech student said: “IISc Bangalore appears to be acting on a plan. Here, the authorities are absolutely clueless.” A notice issued by IIT registrar B.N. Singh on June 10 read: “Since the academic session 2019-20 has been closed and all academic activities will be completed within June 15 and the normal academic activities may only start from September, we request the students (UG, PG, research scholars) and project staff who are staying in the hostels/ halls to proceed for their home now. The institute will close mess facilities in all hostels/halls with effect from June 20.”Repeated calls to registrar Singh went unanswered. He did not respond to text messages either.An official said the mess staff and ward boys were forced to stay on as they had to take care of the students. “As there was no summer vacation this year, the 500-odd mess staff could not go home. Now, they want to go home,” he said.",2020-12-06 19:37:00
1907,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus pandemic: Nine KPC Medical College and Hospital Kolkata doctors quit over fear of putting aged kin at risk - Telegraph India,"Nine doctors have resigned from a private medical college and hospital in the city, reportedly in the apprehension that their aged relatives at home could be at risk if they treated Covid-19 patients, officials of the health department as well as the facility said on Friday.KPC Medical College and Hospital, which lost the nine doctors, filled the vacancies with newly recruited doctors.“Some doctors from the obstetrics and gynaecology department have resigned because they were apprehensive about treating Covid-19 patients. They have elderly people at home. We have resolved the issue by recruiting new doctors immediately,” Joydip Mitra, CEO of KPC Medical College and Hospital, said.He said the doctors who had resigned were from all age groups, “not just the elderly”.Asymptomatic pregnant women have tested positive for Covid-19 at several Calcutta hospitals, which may have frightened some gynaecologists, public health experts said.Sources said a couple of weeks ago, the doctors who later resigned had sought more clarity from the hospital authorities on which patients had tested positive for Covid-19. The hospital denied any lack of clarity. “There is a clear demarcation for Covid and non-Covid patients. There is no lack of transparency on our part,” said a KPC official. Last month, a wing of the hospital in Jadavpur was turned into a designated Covid-19 treatment centre by the Bengal government. KPC officials said a five-storey building with 206 beds, including 13 in the intensive care unit, had been turned into a Covid-19 wing. The hospital has 750 beds overall.Several senior doctors at some private hospitals in Calcutta are largely avoiding seeing patients for fear of contracting Covid-19, their authorities said. Officials at AMRI Hospitals said many elderly doctors were refusing to see more than five or six patients at the outpatient department.“Today, I had a discussion with some of these doctors and requested them to see more patients. Only a few patients are coming to the hospital now for treatment, and if we refuse them too, it is unfortunate,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. Public health experts said the fear of Covid-19 was influencing the way some segments of society were treating the patients.“The fear of Covid is there across society and not only among doctors. The fear is affecting the outcome of Covid management in India,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health expert. People in home isolation are often hounded by their neighbours, and many doctors are refusing to see patients. Some local politicians have been accused of falsely demonising people who had tested positive for Covid-19.Many other doctors are, however, treating patients after taking precautions. “Two pregnant women whom I was treating had tested positive for Covid-19. But I’m taking precautions and treating patients. I’m getting myself tested for Covid at regular intervals so that I know whether I have been infected,” said gynaecologist Bikash Banerjee.",2020-12-06 20:43:00
1909,Monalisa Chaudhuri,Crime too took lockdown break in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The lockdown has left several Calcuttans in financial crisis, including petty criminals.According to Lalbazar sources, the average number of daily offences came down from 450 to around 100 during the lockdown period till May.“The crime rate under different heads came down significantly in April and May, when the majority of people were staying indoors. Quite possible the criminals, too, were at home fearing infection,” said an officer at Lalbazar.Another possible reason for the dip could be visibility of policemen on the roads – all focusing on implementation of the lockdown. Calcutta police prosecuted hundreds of men and women on the roads for alleged violation of the lockdown without any valid reason.In one such case, a man found loitering on a road in New Alipore was found to be fleeing after stealing a mobile phone in Behala. He was among the 3,000-odd jail inmates who had been released to avoid crowding in correctional homes, a step taken to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.An officer said as roads were empty and so many cops were around, it was difficult to commit an offence and flee undetected.No dacoity cases were recorded in Calcutta in April and May. On an average, at least one or two cases are usually reported every month, a source said.Officers could not recall the last time the central lock-up at Lalbazar was empty, as it was for a few days in April.The average number of cases of two-wheelers being stolen came down from 16 between January and March to five a month in April and May.“It was practically impossible for anyone to steal a motorcycle during that period because almost no one was leaving their vehicles parked on roads,” said an officer.An officer said as the majority of the citizens were forced to stay indoors during the lockdown, the number of thefts committed by domestic help had gone down, according to the crime records at Lalbazar. Between January and March, on an average, 11 cases of “servant theft” were reported every month.The figures came down to two a month in April and May. “Many families anyway granted leave to their help. And those who were working must have found the houses too crowded to make an attempt,” the officer said.",2020-12-06 21:06:00
1910,Subhajoy Roy,Paucity of pulses in Kolkata results in price hike - Telegraph India,"Difficulty in procuring pulses from other states owing to transportation problems and poor harvest because of shortage of agricultural labourers — both results of the lockdown — have together led to a paucity of the items in Calcutta, resulting in a sharp price hike. Bengal produces less than one-fourth of the pulses it consumes and has to depend on Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, among other states, to meet the shortfall. After the lockdown was imposed on March 25, many traders found it difficult to bring in vehicles carrying pulses and spices from various states. Rabindranath Koley, a member of the state government-appointed task force that monitors prices in various markets, said the traders told them that though the Union government had said that there would be no restrictions on the movement of vehicles carrying essential commodities during the lockdown, the reality was different. “There was no problem if the truck carrying pulses were only moving between the originating state and our state. But when the truck had to pass through one or two other states, the authorities were often not allowing their movement,” said Koley. “The traders told us about this when we were probing the rise in the prices of pulses.”The result is a 20 to 40 per cent hike in prices of pulses in most places. “I bought masoor dal for Rs 100 a kilo in May. This month it is Rs 140 a kilo. Moong dal was selling at Rs 130 a kilo in May. The price has shot up to Rs 160 a kilo in June,” said a Behala resident, who buys the entire month’s pulses and spices together at the beginning of the month.Debayan Basu, a resident of Maniktala, talked about a similar experience. “I have noticed that the prices of almost all pulses and spices have gone up,” he said.Agricultural scientists said Bengal had to depend on other states for pulses and spices. “The demand for pulses in Bengal is 17-18 lakh tonnes a year and the state can produce only about 4 lakh tonnes a year, which is less than one-fourth of the demand. Naturally, transportation hazards during the lockdown disrupted the supply chain,” said Rajib Nath, a professor of agronomy at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya in Nadia.The spike did not happen uniformly across the city. In some places, it happened a few weeks back and in some other pockets, the effect is being felt now. At some places, the prices shot up within a couple of weeks of the start of the lockdown.Traders said there were multiple reasons for the hike taking effect at different times across the city. “Every wholesaler or retailer has some stock. It took some time to clear the old stock. The local produce filled in the void in many places. But as time passed, the effect of the supply shortage from other states was felt,” said a trader.Nath said the prices were unlikely to go down any time soon. The Union government, he said, is yet to assess the effect of the lockdown on farm produce, something he said would be huge.Shortage of labour also had an impact on the prices. “The government had said the movement restrictions would not apply on essential commodities, but there was no plan to allow movement of people working in agricultural fields. In many places, farm labourers could not work in the fields, resulting in poor harvesting in states that grow pulses. We are feeling the pinch now,” he said.Koley said the task force would report the reasons for the price rise to the state government when it would next meet its officials. The task force and state government officials would meet twice a month but no meeting has held since the lockdown was imposed on March 25, Koley said.",2020-12-06 21:13:00
1912,Debraj Mitra,Weather update: Monsoons arrive with a bang in Bengal - Telegraph India,"The monsoon set foot in Calcutta on Friday, bringing formidable rain along with it, unlike the meek entries over the past few years.The strong monsoon currents were attributed to a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal. The Met office recorded around 39mm of rain in Alipore since Friday morning.  “The monsoon has set in over most parts of Bengal, including Calcutta. Conditions are favourable for its advancement into the remaining parts over the next 24 hours,” said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, deputy director general, India Meteorological Department, Calcutta.Between 5.30pm on Thursday and 5.30pm on Friday, New Market received around 50mm of rain, Cossipore 35mm and Joka 30mm, according to pumping stations of the civic body.For the past few years, the monsoon's arrival in Calcutta had been timid. Met officials said a low-pressure area over the Bay was behind the widespread rain. “The monsoon winds are strong because of a low-pressure area over the Odisha and Andhra coast. The system is expected to trigger light to moderate rain in Gangetic Bengal, including Calcutta, over the next 48 hours,” said a Met official.The monsoon entered south Bengal and north Bengal the same day. The usual onset date for north Bengal is June 5 and south Bengal June 8.The maximum temperature on Friday was 31.2 degrees, three notches below normal. “Saturday’s maximum will be around 30 degrees. Once the low-pressure area dissipates, the temperature will rise,” said a Met official.",2020-12-06 21:16:00
1914,Subhajoy Roy,Cyclone Amphan: Choked pits test monsoon-readiness in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"The monsoon’s first rain on Friday led to waterlogging along the kerbs on several roads, triggering questions whether the accumulated debris inside the rainwater catch pits have been cleaned for a seamless flow. Waterlogging was witnessed on stretches of Park Street, MG Road, Central Avenue, Sarat Bose Road and Raja Basanta Roy Road, among others. Along P Majumdar Road in Kasba, residents of an apartment block found water flowing back through the drainage line and flooding the driveway. “We cleaned the drainage line in our compound after Amphan. So, it cannot be that the line is choked. It seems there is some sort of block in the pit in the lane outside the apartment block, with which the internal drainage line is connected,” said a resident. The weather office said the rain was spread out across the city. Calcuttans residing in various parts of the city said the rain was not very intense for a long duration but it came in spells. Between 5.30pm on Thursday and 5.30pm on Friday, New Market received around 50mm of rain, Cossipore got 35mm and Joka 30mm, according to pumping stations of the civic body. Tarak Singh, a member of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation’s board of administrators, who is in charge of drainage, admitted that cleaning of the catch pits could not be done like in other years because of the lockdown and the consequent staff shortage. “We have fallen behind by two to three months because of the lockdown. Our personnel are now working day and night but the volume of work is huge and it is taking time,” said Singh. He added the civic personnel first desilted the manholes and catch pits/gully pits in the waterlogging-prone areas. Next, they are focussing on places from where complaints of waterlogging are coming.Another Kasba resident said he had seen bubbles forming on the manhole lid on a stretch of BB Chatterjee Road. An engineer explained that this could happen if there was a block in the drainage line. Residents of parts of south Calcutta said they had not seen any civic worker clean the catch pits or manholes in the last two or three months. Engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said removing the sludge that accumulated in the sump of catch pits and manholes was one of the most important tasks of the civic body before the monsoon.An architect acquainted with the design of Calcutta’s underground drainage network said the branches dumped by the kerbside after trees were uprooted by Cyclone Amphan had also contributed to accumulation of sludge in catch pits. “The foliage of the trees blocked the catch pits in several places. In some places, some of the foliage even slipped through the lid of catch pits and went inside the sump, blocking a part of it,” he said. The catch pits — bigger ones are called gully pits — have lids that can be seen along the kerbs of a road. Under the lid, there is a sump or a container that is connected to a channel linking the sump with the main drainage line under that road. The rain water from the sump flows into the main drainage line through this channel. The mouth of the channel is located on the upper half of the sump. This is done so that dust and debris flowing into the sump from the road settles down and only the water flows through the channel. “If foliage settles in the sump, it could partially block the mouth of the channel.

1915,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Coronavirus pandemic: Churches under Church of North India to allow 25 worshippers - Telegraph India,"Churches under the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) will allow a maximum of 25 people to enter at a time, but not without a mask, the bishop said in a letter addressed to the presbyters on Friday.The letter was sent in keeping with the state government order that has permitted a maximum of 25 people — instead of 10, as decided earlier — to enter a place of worship.The CNI cited a state government order dated June 8 that permits up to 25 persons to enter at a time. “You are advised to act accordingly while allowing persons to enter inside church for prayer and meditation (maintaining proper social distancing). You also need to follow strictly all other mandatory precautions at the point of entry, like thermal screening, hand sanitisation and not allowing anyone without mask,” Reverend Paritosh Canning, bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI, said in a letter to presbyters-in-charge and presbyters of all pastorates.The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta, however, will continue to allow only 10 people in the church, the archdiocese said on Friday.“There has been no change in the archdiocese position regarding the number of worshippers allowed in the church. This remains at 10 persons, regardless of any relaxation by the civic authorities,” said Father Dominic Gomes, the vicar-general of the archdiocese of Calcutta.The update was sent to all 65-odd Roman Catholic churches under the archdiocese on Thursday so that there is no ambiguity in the number of people who are allowed in the church.The archdiocese had given permission to resume services from June 1.The 107 churches in the Barrackpore diocese will also allow 25 people each.The Calcutta diocese of the CNI has 34 churches, where services are yet to resume.Reverend Canning has also called for all arrangements and preparations, particularly “sanitising and disinfecting the church premises” for services to start in July with adequate social distancing.There has to be preparations for having two/three services on Sundays and whenever necessary. “...If you are adequately prepared in all respects, then you may start the same from the last week of June with the approval of the bishop,” Reverend Canning wrote.",2020-12-06 21:38:00
1917,Jhinuk Mazumdar,Lockdown: South Point trusts students with integrity pledge - Telegraph India,"South Point High School students have to pledge to uphold the school’s and their teachers’ faith in them and take a set of tests without the direct supervision of teachers.The school has sent the “code of honour” expected of students and a detailed plan to parents on the way the school will assess how much each student has learnt so far.Parents have been requested to invigilate the tests, which will be held in the pen-and-paper mode.Many schools in the city have been using technology to monitor students during exams but some have rested the responsibility on parents and students.It is time to inculcate a sense of integrity in students as well, a teacher of a city school said.“I do understand that I will be taking a set of tests to assess the learning outcome without the direct supervision of my teachers and my school. I promise that I will uphold my teachers’ faith in me and shall conduct myself with honesty.... I hope to live up to my teachers’ and parents’ expectations, now and always,” reads the code of honour sent to each student of Classes VI to XII.They will have to read it out before the start of the tests.The principal said in a note to parents on Tuesday: “Under these unusual and unpredictable circumstances, the collaboration between the parents and us teachers has taken a more meaningful turn, and based on that strength we hope to make... the process a complete success. Any outside help the child gets during this assessment process will only harm his or her academic progress.”Several other city schools are relying on the cooperation of parents to conduct tests during the pandemic.Some schools such as Modern High School for Girls and Calcutta Girls’ High School have worked out the modalities to conduct the terminal exams in September.The exams of both these schools will be held under the supervision of parents at home. In Modern High, students will have to download the question papers, write the answers and upload the answer scripts. “Parents have to supervise the exams and create a secure environment at home. We have been speaking to our girls… if they do something academically dishonest ultimately they will harm themselves,” Damayanti Mukherjee, principal of Modern High, said.Calcutta Girls’ High School has decided to split a question paper into sets of three and students will have to take the tests during online classes.The school will send out a note to parents to invigilate the exams. “It will be an appeal to parents to invigilate the exams at home. We have to teach the child to be honest and responsible,” principal Basanti Biswas said.Several teachers said the pandemic had presented an opportunity to teach children life’s lessons like discipline, responsibility and integrity.“It is part of self-discipline and teaching students to take full responsibility of their thoughts and actions. No matter whatever circumstances or disadvantages are one will not compromise if the person considers it to be wrong,” Mukherjee said.South Point has decided to award grades instead of marks and there will be no ranks. “While we expect students to follow what we have said, we have strategised the entire process… to take away from students any incentive to indulge in any unfair means,” Krishna Damani, trustee of South Point, said.Apeejay Schools will follow the same principle and teachers will have to frame questions that do not have direct answers. “If parents assist their children they should know they are throwing up their children’s future,” administrator Reeta Chatterjee said.",2020-12-08 01:44:00
1918,Sanjay Mandal,Covid: Kolkata hospitals contest panel’s deposit logic - Telegraph India,"The Bengal health regulatory commission’s view that its permission to private hospitals to take deposits during admission was aimed at striking a balance between patients’ convenience and keeping hospitals viable does not hold good, officials of several healthcare units said on Tuesday.The officials also described as impractical another part of the commission’s advisory, which states that hospitals can ask for removal of a patient if the family fails to pay the deposit within a stipulated time.The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission had on Saturday issued an advisory allowing private hospitals to take up to Rs 50,000 or 20 per cent of the estimated treatment cost, whichever is less, as advance during admission.Private hospitals cannot refuse admission if a patient cannot pay the sum immediately, but the money has to be paid within 12 hours. If a patient fails to pay up within that time, the hospital can ask that the bed be vacated within an hour, the advisory said.A senior official of a private hospital said taking the deposit during admission and viability were not connected.“It’s true that if the hospital cannot recover the entire cost of treatment from a patient, its viability is affected. But I don’t think that paying the deposit during admission is a guarantee that the patient or his or her relatives would pay the entire remaining cost at the time of discharge,” said Sudipta Mitra, the chief executive of Peerless Hospital. He said many elderly people are brought to hospital for admission by a relative, neighbour or some other person because their children live elsewhere. The person accompanying such a patient usually does not pay any deposit during admission.“Elderly people living in housing complexes are often accompanied by guards. There is no question that a guard will pay the deposit. But the patient’s son or daughter, who stays elsewhere, sends the money in a day or two or the patient makes arrangement himself or herself. At the time of discharge the bill is paid in full,” said Mitra.In many other cases, however, the initial deposit is paid, but the patient’s family throws up their hands when the treatment cost goes up. “In such situations we have to forgo a substantial part of the treatment cost. All private hospitals face such situations,” Mitra said.Relatives of a patient on Tuesday alleged that Desun Hospital, off EM Bypass, had taken a deposit of nearly Rs 3 lakh but did not treat the patient, who died in an ambulance.Retired judge Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairperson of the regulatory commission, said the panel would look into the matter if a relative of the patient lodged a complaint. “Earlier, too, there were allegations against the hospital,” said Banerjee.Tapas Mukherjee, a senior official of Desun, did not take calls from Metro on Tuesday evening.The commission chairperson said the new advisory on deposit was aimed at striking a balance. “Many hospitals were taking huge amounts as deposits. We tried to cap the amount. At the same time, hospitals need to stay viable,” he said. Officials of several private hospitals said the advisory to admit a patient provisionally for 12 hours and then discharge within an hour if relatives fail to pay the deposit was “impractical”.“Treating a patient gets priority over money. If a patient is admitted, then treatment continues irrespective of whether the payment is made at that point in time or not,” said Rupak Barua, the Group CEO of AMRI Hospitals and the president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, an organisation of private hospitals in Bengal.“To discharge a patient undergoing treatment, we need relatives to sign a discharge-against-medical advice form. Unless the form is signed with proper justification, we cannot discharge a patient undergoing treatment, irrespective of the payment status,” said Barua.The CEO of another private hospital said that a patient could not be discharged without the clearance of the doctor treating him or her. “On many occasions, when the treatment cost shoots up and family members say they cannot pay the amount, we counsel them to shift the person to a government faci-lity. It can take more than two days to shift such patients. It can’t be done in an hour,” he said.The commission’s advisory also says that for any inves-tigation above Rs 2,000, a hospital has to take the consent of a patient’s family. This was because the commission found that many expensive investigations were repeated, which was pushing up the cost.“Most investigations for a Covid patient cost more than Rs 2,000. Is it possible to take consent for every test over the phone?” the CEO of a private hospital asked. “My hospital has around 600 beds. It’s not possible to take consent for so many patients.”",2020-12-08 01:52:00
1919,Sanjay Mandal,Lockdown: Travel agents write to Bengal government for flight resumption - Telegraph India,"Travel agents’ associations on Tuesday have written to the state government requesting it to resume flights between Calcutta and six cities and also international repatriation flights.Flights to Calcutta from Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur Chennai and Ahmedabad — the cities that have high Covid prevalence — have remained suspended since July 6  following a request from the state government. The ban was to end on August 15 but has been extended till August 31.“We seek your support to reconsider this suspension so that the residents of West Bengal who are stranded in these cities and also the business travellers who could bring in business engagements/revenue to Bengal, can avail (of) these direct services,” reads a letter from the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) and the Travel Agents’ Association of India (TAAI) to Bengal home secretary Alapan Bandyopdhyay.“We seek your approval to restart the Bubble flights/ Repatriation flights /operations from /by the International Carriers (subject to the approval from our State Government as per our State Government’s SOP) (Not just the charter flights).... We need your support towards restarting, restructuring and restoring the travel and tourism industry.”Anil Punjabi, chairman, east, TAFI, said they had recommended safety measures such as making all arriving passengers undergo the rapid antigen test for Covid-19 at the Calcutta airport.“If a passenger refuses to undergo the test, he or she will have to undergo 14 days’ home quarantine. The health department counter at the airport will issue quarantine documents, copies of which will be given to the local municipal corporation/panchayat office and the local police station for intimation and close monitoring,” he said.“We have decided to write the letter together to make our voices heard. Resuming flights is vital for our business,” said Manav Soni, the chairman of TAAI’s eastern region.Representatives of airlines said they, too, would write a similar letter to the state government shortly, pleading for resumption of flights between Calcutta and the six cities as well as repatriation flights.The state had stopped repatriation flights after many passengers, most of them medical students, refused institutional quarantine after arriving in the city.The government has recently allowed chartered evacuation flights with passengers testing negative for Covid-19 within 96 hours before the departure. “Special operating protocol can be put in place to ensure that,” said a senior official at the airport.",2020-12-08 01:57:00

1921,Snehal Sengupta,Hawkers trigger VIP Road snarls in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Hawkers selling fish, vegetables and poultry products have taken over multiple stretches of VIP Road resulting in traffic chaos almost every day.A 100m stretch in front of the Baguiati bus stop on the airport-bound and the Bypass-bound flanks, a 50m stretch in front of Kestopur and a 150m stretch in front of Kaikhali are the worst hit.Every morning and evening, hawkers set up stalls by laying plastic sheets on the road or park their vans and carts on the road eating into its space. People, too, park their vehicles at random and continue to shop. Also, shoppers headed to Baguiati market park their vehicles along VIP Road. The result: traffic snarls on both flanks of the road.These stalls and parked vehicles have been creating bottlenecks on an important road that connects the city with the airport, an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said. “We conduct regular drives and ask hawkers to move away. The problem is the moment they see cops or a police vehicle approaching, they pack up and leave only to return the moment cops are gone.”Bangshagopal Dolui, who sells fruits on a van, said he had switched to selling fruits after losing his driver’s job during the lockdown. “I was asked to leave as Covid-19 kicked in. From earning Rs 12,000 a month I was staring at no earnings… I started selling fruits.”Dolui said he chose VIP Road as many motorists and two-wheeler riders stop to buy fruits from him before continuing on their journey.On a Monday evening, Metro saw at least 60 cars parked on VIP Road in a haphazard manner. Almost all of them were locked and had no drivers. A few drivers leaned against the vehicles and chatted.“Babu bazaar-e gechen. Ekhanei gari rakhi (Sir has gone to the market. I usually park here),” the driver of an SUV parked in front a “No Parking” board said.There was not a single traffic cop in sight.“No Parking” boards are spread all across the road but absence of cops make it easy for motorists and two-wheeler riders flout signage all over the road motorists and two-wheeler riders to flout the rule.Vehicles and hawkers occupy the road space daily, several residents Metro spoke to said. Also, many go for parallel parking and it adds to the chaos, some said.The service lane in front of the PWD office is almost filled with hawkers selling snacks on carts.There are hardly any cops and snarls are regular with buses, autos, cycles and rickshaws fighting for space on the road, Subhrojyoti Mukherjee, a resident of Baguiati, said.“Hawkers just set up their stalls on the road. As it is footpaths are with them, now they have started encroaching on roads as well. Mornings and evenings are a nightmare on the road,” Mukherjee said. “Most of the people who park here are residents of the area. They often ask officers to find them alternative parking spots when they cops try to prosecute them or their drivers,” an officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate said.",2020-12-08 02:18:00
1922,"Subhajoy Roy, Snehal Sengupta",Craters on Kolkata roads blamed on Covid - Telegraph India,"The Covid-19 pandemic, apparently, has hit the city’s roads, too.Engineers of several state government agencies are blaming the battered state of so many roads in Calcutta on the lack of repairs ahead of the monsoon because of curbs imposed to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus.Every year, roads in the city are repaired twice — before the monsoon and again before Durga Puja. This year, the pre-monsoon repairs could not be taken up in most places as the country was in lockdown in April and May, the crucial period for repairs, said engineers from the public works department (PWD), Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). These three agencies are custodians of most roads of Calcutta.Even after the “complete lockdown” was lifted, getting skilled hands proved to be a challenge, a hurdle the agencies are yet to overcome. On top of that, the government is having a tough time arranging for funds for repairs because of a sharp drop in revenues following the pandemic, a CMDA official said.“We have to now answer a much longer list of questions, compared with the pre-Covid times, before funds are sanctioned,” the official said.“The situation this year is quite bad. All agencies repair broken roads during summer. Still the road surface wears out during the monsoon. This year there was no repair. So, imagine how bad the condition will be,” said an engineer of the CMC.The result is evident for commuters. A resident of Gariahat had last week experienced a bone-rattling ride down Garia Main Road, which he said was riddled with potholes and giant craters.Multiple stretches of EM Bypass are in a sorry state, too. The stretch near the Ruby crossing is particularly bad, said a regular commuter. A 150-metre stretch leading to the crossing on the Ruby-bound flank of the Bypass has multiple craters and potholes.Puddles have formed on the undulating road here and there, making it more difficult for motorists to gauge the depth of a pothole. “I was about to fall off my two-wheeler when it hit a deep pothole while I was returning from office on Monday evening,” said Chandan Banerjee, a resident of New Garia.Metro spotted cops filling a pothole with crushed bricks at the New Alipore rotary crossing on Sunday. “Vehicles are skirting the pothole, resulting in long snarls. So we are filling it up,” an officer at the spot said.The police have also put up a guardrail to steer motorists away from a crater on Deshapran Sashmal Road, near its crossing at Tollygunge Phari.Several main roads in Salt Lake are also riddled with craters and potholes. The road leading to the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre complex, on Broadway, from the Tank number 13 bus stop in IA Block is filled with craters, some of which are spread across the width of the flank.On Tuesday, Metro saw several two-wheelers, cars and autorickshaws switch flanks and drive down the wrong lane to avoid the pothole-ridden stretch. Driving down roads adjacent to the City Centre, near the P&T Housing Complex, that cut through the DC Block, is a nightmare. Namrata Agarwal, a resident of DC Block, said roads in the block had not been repaired over the past six months.An official of the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation said they had conducted a survey of the bad roads in the township and would carry out patchwork repairs for the time being.",2020-12-08 02:54:00

1924,Kinsuk Basu,Extortionist in bank fraud net in Kolkata - Telegraph India,"Sheikh Vinod, an extortionist with several cases pending against him, was arrested in the Regent Park area early on Tuesday in connection with a bank fraud, police said.The fraud came to light after officials of a nationalised bank in Purba Putiari unearthed “suspicious transactions” in an account, the police said.Vinod was trying to set up a network to call up unsuspecting account holders and dupe them into making payments. He has been booked for cheating, the police said.“We started investigating the matter after the bank’s branch manager filed an FIR claiming a Patna resident had complained to the bank saying money from his account had been siphoned off online,” an officer of Regent Park police station said.While investigating the complaint filed by Kumar Anand, cops stumbled upon Chaman Singh’s account, which showed “unusual transactions”.“On August 7, when Singh turned up at the branch to withdraw a hefty amount, bank officials questioned him about the sudden spurt in transactions in his account. When he failed to explain, the officials alerted us,” the officer said.Singh turned out to be Vinod’s driver.Cops later found Vinod had received money from eight similar accounts but he could not offer any satisfactory explanation regarding its source, the police said.The Telegraph  had recently reported how several people in Calcutta have been cheated on the phone by the Jamtara gang.“We are trying to find out if Vinod tried to replicate the Jamtara model here,” an officer said. “Vinod was out on bail and we thought he would mend his ways. It appears he hasn’t.”Having lived in and out of jails for over a decade now, Vinod’s name had cropped up recently in connection with an extortion complaint. The owner of a dhaba on Syed Amir Ali Avenue near Quest Mall had alleged that Vinod had demanded Rs 5 lakh as “goonda tax”.A car hit multiple barricades along Kidderpore Road and Mayo Road minutes before the Independence Day parade rehearsals were about to start on Red Road around 6.30am on Tuesday, police said. A 20-year-old college student, who was at the wheel, was arrested and later released on bail. He is a resident of Bondel Road in Ballygunge.",2020-12-08 05:05:00

The areas are spread over Hingalganj in North 24-Parganas and Gosaba in South 24-Parganas.The fruits are taken to nurseries — under Gobindokathi, Kalitala and Gosaba village panchayats. The seeds are planted in the soil and sand mixture kept inside polythene packs.The base with the sapling is then replanted on the riverbank. Over 150 acres of land has been allocated by two village panchayats — Gobindokathi and Gosba — for replanting the saplings.According to government estimates, Cyclone Amphan ravaged 1,600sq km of the 4,200sq km of the Sunderbans forests.The project by Kolkata Society for Cultural Heritage is aimed at preserving the ecology as well as generating income for people of the area.Mangroves are known for viviparous germination where seeds germinate and develop into saplings while still attached to the parent tree. “If they get favourable conditions, they can form a colony,” said Sugata Hazra, director, School of Oceanographic Sciences, Jadavpur University.The replantation drive started in the middle of June. “Over 800,000 fruits have been collected to date. Around 272,000 saplings have been planted,” said Sourav Mukherjee, the founder of the NGO.The NGO requests companies and individuals to adopt a bunch of trees.“Till now 60,000 trees have been adopted, each for Rs 50 on average,” said Arpita Mukherjee, the coordinator of the project.Tens of thousands of people have returned to the Sunderbans from other cities because of the pandemic.“Mangrove plantation is helping us economically and shielding the environment as well,” said Binodini Mondal, who has been working on the project.",2020-12-08 05:20:00

The tests will rev-eal whether the vehicle had any snag that led to the accident.The mangled remains of the Scorpio had to be separated from the truck with a Wrecker before the three bodies could be extracted. Chatterjee was sitting in the middle seat, while her guard was sitting next to the driver.Chatterjee, who earlier served as an assistant commissioner and a deputy commissioner (women) in the Calcutta police, was the first woman in the force to have been assigned the responsibility to lead a police station, a job usually handled by men.A graduate in geography, Chatterjee had joined the city police force in 1988.

The students have been attending online classes from home since April.The letter to Kulkarni says: “You would be aware that recently IIT Kharagpur had to decide to vacate its hostels due to continuing spread of COVID-19. According to recent news reports, a student of the PGPX programme at IIM Ahmedabad who had been allowed to come into campus has tested positive for COVID-19. News like this has caused considerable anxiety to different stakeholders — campus residents, other faculty and staff who regularly visit campus for official work — who would be impacted by this decision.”Raising questions about the absence of consultations on the matter, the teachers ask: “What steps did our institute take to ensure that stakeholders were consulted before taking this decision with potentially grave consequences for their health and safety?”Metro contacted Kulkarni but he said he could not talk because he was busy at a meeting. He did not respond to text messages.Repeated calls to director Anju Seth went unanswered.

1930,Kinsuk Basu ,1400 tonnes of Bangladeshi Hilsa for Bengal - Telegraph India,"Bangladesh will export more than 1,400 tonnes of Hilsa to Bengal, the largest consignment in recent times, according to several fish exporters in Dhaka.The Bangladesh government’s permission to Hilsa exporters (order dated September 10, 2020) says the allowance is for Durga Puja and will remain valid till October 10.The fish, packed in styrofoam boxes, will start reaching Calcutta from next week and will be delivered in phases by trucks crossing over the Petrapole border outpost near Bongaon in North 24-Parganas.“Last year, the Bangladesh government had sent 500 tonnes of Hilsa as a goodwill gesture to Bengal ahead of Durga Puja. This time the volume is nearly three times that,” Syed Anwar Maqsood, secretary of the West Bengal Fish Importers’ Association. “Apart from markets in Calcutta, Howrah and adjoining areas, we will distribute this Hilsa to the wholesale fish markets in North Bengal as well.”“This has been a good season for the Padma Hilsa in Bangladesh,” Kazi Abdul Manna, director of Seven Star Fish Processing Limited in Bangladesh, told Metro from Pabna. “The government has allowed nine fish merchants to export Hilsa this time against one last year. The size of the fish will vary between 900g and 1.2kg. We hope you enjoy the taste.”Despite a flicker of hope, this year has been somewhat frustrating for fishermen in parts of Patharpratima, Kultali, and Frasergunge in South 24-Parganas and in Digha and Sankarpur in East Midnapore who have been venturing into the seas for their catch of Hilsa.“Fishermen couldn’t venture into the seas like previous years because of inclement weather and the lockdown,” Chandranath Sinha, the state fisheries minister, said.The production of Hilsa in Bengal has dwindled from around 80,000 tonnes in 2001 to close to 15,000 tonnes in 2013 to around 10,000 tonnes in 2017 largely because of excess fishing in the Bay of Bengal.The Bengal government has now banned the catching of Hilsa between April 15 and June 14, the breeding season of the fish.Bangladesh, in comparison, has been able to check the declining Hilsa population by banning fishing during the breeding period and establishing sanctuaries for the fish.",2020-12-09 02:46:00
1931,Subhajoy Roy,Kolkata Parkomat repairs for full use - Telegraph India,"Parkomat, a multi-storey car park at the intersection of Rawdon Street and Park Street, will undergo repairs to make it fully operational. Half the capacity of the facility has been lying unused for years, while cars found it difficult to get a parking space on and around Park Street.Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), which manages the car park, said a company had been hired to repair the faults in the hydraulic system in the third and half of the second tier of the three-tier facility. The repairs will allow about 70 more cars to be parked at Parkomat, said an official.Parkomat can accommodate 165 cars but it has been operating at half its capacity for years. A fully functional Parkomat will benefit many people who drive to their offices located on Park Street or some of the roads running perpendicular to it and have to struggle every day to find a parking spot.The CMC official said he had received many letters from such people who spoke about difficulties they faced in parking their cars.“Once all slots are functional, patients and their families visiting Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre will find it easier to parktheir cars. Now they have a harrowing time scouting for space,” said a traffic police officer.“We have selected a company to do the repairs. The repairs will be completed within a month after they start. We are waiting for funds to be allotted for the repairs before we ask the company to start work,” said a CMC official.The tender for the repair project was floated before the pandemic struck in India. Since April, no work could be done. Recently, there has again been some progress and the CMC officials hope repairs will start soon. “The pandemic will end one day. We want to make the facility fully operational before things become normal again, which is why we are pushing ahead with the project,” an official said.“In the pre-pandemic period, many cars would park along the sides of Rawdon Street, especially near Bhagirathi Neotia hospital. The cars mostly belonged to patients visiting the hospital. Many of them were pregnant women and babies. The cars would eat up the road space at the junction of Rawdon Street and Park Street. If the capacity of the Parkomat is increased, the road will hopefully be free,” said a police officer.The Parkomat was built as a joint venture between the CMC and Simplex Infrastructures Limited. It began operation in 2000. An official of Simpark Infrastructure, a group company of Simplex that ran Parkomat, said that even when the hydraulic system was fully operational, the upper tiers remained empty mostly. “Cars used to park along the roads and police did not force them to enter Parkomat,” he said.The parking charges at Parkomat are higher than what one has to pay to park a car on a road. The Parkomat rates for four-wheelers and two-wheelers are Rs 35 and Rs 11 an hour, respectively. The corresponding rates for road parking are Rs 10 and Rs 5.According to the CMC’s website, owners of four-wheelers can book monthly parking slots at Parkomat for Rs 3,450 (24 hours daily), Rs 2,300 (12 hours during day time) and Rs 1,725 (12 hours at night).Another hydraulic parking facility in the city, outside New Market, has been functioning at around half its capacity for years. The facility can accommodate over 200 cars but now has slots for only 100-odd cars.",2020-12-09 02:48:00
1932,Sudeshna Banerjee,"Coronavirus lockdown: Durga reaches home, 40 days before schedule - Telegraph India","The goddess Durga has arrived in a house near Entally, 40 days before she steps into pandals or thakurdalans, while organisers wait for the government’s instructions on Durga Puja.The Das family in Seal Lane follows the longest of the seven prescribed periods of worship, starting on the ninth day of the new moon fortnight before Devipaksha or the divine full moon fortnight. And this year, because of the mala mash (a lunar month with two new moons when no auspicious rituals can take place) the gap with the schedule followed by most pujas has got even bigger.This year, because of the pandemic and the lockdown, attendance was thin on Day 1 of the puja. “None of our relatives could come. Because of the situation, we have not pressured them to come, too,” said Prosenjit Das, who does the puja himself since the inception in 2008.Two priests, in masks and sitting apart, are assisting him. They are the only outsiders allowed.The family has taken other precautions, too. “We are offering only whole fruits as naibedya. The duration of the daily rituals will be shortened. The surfaces are being periodically sanitised. Nor will bhog be offered to 200-300 people as is our custom on Mahanavami,” said Das.They are unsure of calling a dhaki. “Usually we have one on duty from Panchami. But we may have to make do with a digital recording this year,” he said.During the mala mash from September 18 to October 18, only nitya puja, done for any household deity, will take place. “As puja will be such a long-drawn affair this year, we had to start preparing a lot in advance,” Prosenjit ’s wife Reema said.Though relatives, including Prosenjit’s sister Moumita who had trained with him on conducting the rituals, could not attend, Das has found an assistant in his six-year-old son Ayush who has insisted on getting his own mini set of conchshell, bell, koshakushi and chamor, and is ready to imitate every move of his father during arati, clad in his little dhoti.“No pandemic can dent his enthusiasm. He says he is a brave boy who does not fear the coronavirus demon,” Reema laughed.",2020-12-09 02:52:00

1934,"Fr. J. Felix Raj, SJ","Swami Agnivesh believed ‘the world is one family’, writes Fr. J. Felix Raj  - Telegraph India","Swami Agnivesh, who was hospitalised due to liver cirrhosis at the Institute of Liver and Billary Sciences (ILBS) in Delhi, passed away on Friday evening. I had spoken to him on Tuesday.The 80-year-old former professor of St Xavier’s College (1963-69) and friend of St. Xavier’s University, Calcutta, and a social activist was an advocate for dialogue between religions. He was involved in various areas of social activism, including campaigns against female feticide and the emancipation of women. He was a prominent associate of Anna Hazare during the India Against Corruption campaign in 2011 to implement the Jan Lokpal Bill.Swami Agnivesh was truly “a man for others”….A sanyasi in the Arya Samaj order, he stood tall, both on the national and international stage, as an educationist, a philanthropist, a philosopher, a spiritualist, most of all as a humanist. The sublime words of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit Order, applies to him perfectly… “He was contemplative in action, finding God in all things”. And also important to me, Swamiji and I were close associates and friends.I met Swami Agnivesh 34 years ago in Delhi, although I had heard of him three years prior to that, while I was a lecturer at St Xavier’s College. He was known for his revolutionary ideas, oratory skills and the bold stand he often took for the liberation of the disadvantaged people.A 14-year-old Sri Lankan girl had been arrested for unlawfully entering India. She was housed in Tihar jail in 1987. My Sri Lankan friends had requested my help for the child. I met Swami Agnivesh seeking his guidance and advice.Both Swamiji and I were at the court when the case came up, we modestly sat in the last row.When the judge entered, he happened to notice Swamiji and questioned his presence. Swamiji explained the context and that he hoped for the smooth release of the minor.Since then our friendship blossomed. We worked on several issues, social and religious.Thereafter I often invited him to visit Xavier institutions, be it the Jesuit College of theology in Delhi, Vidyajothi, St Xavier’s College or St Xavier’s University, Kolkata. He also figures amongst one of the most notable and prominent former faculty members of St Xavier’s College.Vepa Syam Rao was born into a Brahmin Telegu family. He completed his Masters from Calcutta University. He taught at St Xavier’s College from 1963 to 1969. At 24, young Rao was inquisitive and curious to know the inner workings of the Belgian Jesuits. One day he sneaked into the Jesuit residence known as cloister and peeped in. The austerity and simplicity of the Jesuit living quarters astounded him... only a table, two chairs, a bed and a wooden almirah.It was unbelievable…. “The Jesuits lived a life of high thinking and simple living,” this made a deep impact on him. While coming out of the Jesuit cloister, Rao met a senior Belgian Jesuit in the corridor. He asked the priest as to what had motivated him to come to the distant shores of India leaving behind his home and the comforts he had had there.The Jesuit answered him: “I am here like my fellow Jesuit Fathers. Our mission is to serve the people of India, particularly of Bengal, mainly to impart quality education to Indian students; this is the humble contribution we hope to make.”Swamiji was deeply impressed and he has often reiterated that this response by the Jesuit priest had an influence on his future life and missionary zeal. He said: “It made me ponder. What is MY mission for India?”Swamiji has always stressed his strong faith in spirituality. He insists that spirituality ought to be social spirituality. This spirituality should not be an individualistic or escapist type. He insists that it should be one that would keep the interest of the society intact; which would depend on the respect for individual interest. These are inextricably linked. They are complimentary… religion must be a thrust for social awakening and revolution.Swamji has written a number of books on this subject to promote and share his views and ideas. He was a bridge between religions, respecting the differences.... “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you,” was his golden rule. He further advocated, if we want life, let us give life to others; if we want opportunities, let us provide these opportunities to others. God’s love is the same for all, no matter what one’s religion or nationality is.He was against the throwaway culture, where people not only throw junk but also the poor, the refugees and the downtrodden. He promoted through his work an education in fraternity for real solidarity. This in fact was the essence of Swamiji’s conviction and work.Swamiji was termed an anti-national, Christian sympathiser. It is forgotten that he believes the world is one family: “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”. God enjoins us to stay united as one family. Swamiji was a messenger of God. He was a giant among men. India is blessed to have him.He was a relentless fighter for the downtrodden, not caring for personal attacks or even results… just fight till something positive emerges was his firm belief. As Shakespeare said, reiterated by Justice V.R Krishna Iyer: “What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god, never at rest but ever in meditative communication with God.”Swamiji was diamond hard in his convictions, honeybee in his sweet collectivism for all suffering humans, a defender of the Constitution and a humanist, aware of the religious pluralism of Bharat. Anything that might destroy the fabric of this country or threaten its development was the recipient of his ire.Swami Agnivesh was indeed a man among men…. A prophet for all seasons on the side of truth and justice with a deep-seated spiritual perspective. A true inspiration. A Karma Yogi.Champion of the socially challenged... A true Arya Samaji.Fr. J. Felix Raj is the vice-chancellor of St Xavier’s University, Calcutta",2020-12-09 03:02:00
1935,Sanjay Mandal,Coronavirus outbreak: Covid surveyors see healthy change - Telegraph India,"The response to the survey to identify comorbidities among Calcuttans, which started four days ago, suggests the city has started taking public health issues more seriously than it did before Covid-19 had struck, those connected with the survey said.Volunteers and health workers who are visiting houses as part of the survey said the resistance they would face during the anti-dengue or polio vaccination drive was missing when they were asking residents about their comorbidities. The survey on comorbidities is being undertaken to make Covid response in the city more focussed.Public health experts and civic officials said the overwhelming death toll of Covid-19  - which till September 11 claimed 3,828 lives in Bengal, including 1,449 in Calcutta - had changed the way people think and act. According to the state health department, 85.9 per cent of those who died after testing positive for the disease had comorbidities, a fact that serves as a pointer to the importance of such a survey.“The change in Calcuttans’ thinking on public health matters reveals how deep an impact Covid has created and the fear it has instilled in our minds,” said a public health expert.  The comorbidity surveillance programme, which started on September 7, targets to cover 10 lakh households across the 144 wards of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). A form is being handed over to residents which asks whether a person is above 60 or has conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiac ailments, kidney ailment, liver disease, cancer, respiratory problems and tuberculosis.    The state health department, CMC and Covid Care Network (a voluntary organisation comprising health officials, doctors and those who have recovered from Covid) are jointly conducting the survey. The CMC has deployed 2,880 workers to collect data from residents. There are 288 supervisors, one for 10 data collectors. The target is to complete the survey in 14 days.Several CMC workers taking part in the survey said they were observing a change in people’s behaviour. “Many would not allow us to enter their premises to find out whether fresh water had accumulated, where dengue mosquitoes breed. We face such problems in highrises and housing complexes... our workers were shooed away from the gates,” said a data collector who did not want to be named.“For the comorbidity survey, we have not yet faced any such problem. Most people are interested to know what this survey is about. Once convinced about it’s need, they are giving all details,” he said.Abhijit Chowdhury, a public health expert and member of the chief minister’s expert team on Covid, had visited several houses in Tollygunge and Kalighat a couple of days ago with data collectors.“In Tollygunge, we went to a house where a middle-aged man came out and asked why we were there. The man listened patiently to the volunteers. Then he asked how a person would benefit from the survey,” Chowdhury recounted.“When he was told that those with comorbidities could get priorities when vaccines for Covid-19 are available, he said there was a person in his family with diabetes.” The experience was the same in Kalighat, too.“I asked the volunteers whether they were facing the resistance they used to face while taking part in dengue prevention programmes. They said there was hardly any resistance. At places where they are not allowed inside, the forms are being distributed through security personnel,” said Chowdhury, who is also the mentor of Covid Care Network.“The volunteers told me that more than 80 to 90 per cent households are actively taking part in the survey. People are getting tuned to the need of the hour and the change is for the better.”When the authorities were planning the comorbidity survey, there were apprehensions about how residents of housing complexes and other pockets would react. Officials had also thought that the fear of catching Covid would make volunteers and health workers reluctant to visit houses.But at least till Friday, officials said, the enthusiasm among volunteers and health workers was high. “Through this challenging period of four or five months, people’s psyche has matured. They are now welcoming surveyors without any inhibitions,” said Subrata Roy Chowdhury, officer on special duty, health, and deputy chief municipal health officer of the CMC. He is the nodal officer for the programme.  He said that unlike dengue or pulse polio, no campaign had been launched for the comorbidity survey. “Despite that, the response is good. People have come to understand that if the comorbidity issue can be addressed, the risk of a Covid patient can be reduced,” he said.A resident of south Calcutta welcomed the way the comorbidity survey was being conducted but had one complaint: the form was only in Bengali. Officials said forms in Hindi and English would soon be distributed.",2020-12-09 03:10:00
1936,Ayanendranath Basu,The man who grasped statistics and its untapped potential - Telegraph India,"In 1981, I was a young man in my late teens, about to make the transition from school to college. My mother was a professor of economics and I was veering towards making a career in economics as well. When our higher secondary results were declared, I went to Presidency College to pick up a form to apply for the honours course in economics. At that time, I was told that each candidate could apply for two subjects. After some thought I picked up another form for statistics. Although I had studied statistics in plus+2, I had not developed a liking for the subject as our statistics teachers in high school could not provide enough motivation for us to develop an appreciation for the topic. Hence, while I may have filled in applications for both subjects, I was not seriously thinking about majoring in statistics at that point of time. Being successful in both admission tests, I then had to decide. Economics or statistics honours? Although I was still overwhelmingly in favour of joining the economics course, I met Prof Atindra Mohan Gun, with whom my father was  acquainted, for advice. I knew that being the head of the department of statistics, his opinion was likely to be biased towards his subject, but I considered myself mature enough to be able to weigh his advice rationally. That meeting changed the course of my life.Of course, Prof Gun explained to me why somebody should study statistics, and what options a well-trained statistician had. He also told me that the discipline was yet to attain its full potential, a statement which seems prophetic today with the emergence of analytics and data science. To some extent, I was expecting to hear such things. But to a greater extent, it was the force of his personality which convinced me. By the time I left his chamber, I had made up my mind. I joined the statistics honours course in Presidency College, and since then, never for a single day in my life have I regretted my decision.It is debatable whether Presidency College in the 1980s was qualitatively at par with the Presidency College of 1950s and 60s. But there is no doubt that it was still the best college of the state. And Prof Gun was prominent among the handful of teachers whose dedication allowed the college to retain this distinction. As a teacher his effectiveness was beyond question. Within the classroom he was a perfectionist. His class-notes were complete in every respect, and simply compiling them was enough to produce a complete textbook. He was also a strict disciplinarian. If a group of students would bunk a certain class, he would send the non-teaching staff to look for them, and, if found, haul them back to class. Occasionally he would wander in the classrooms of younger teachers and observe, sometimes for long durations, how they fared in class. Yet, he was a classic old school professor, who cared not only about students’ education but also about their complete well-being. There was an aura about him, which all teachers and professors hope to attain, but very few actually do. He was an institution by himself.Prof Gun was extremely protective of the status and stature of Presidency College. He strongly resented any move to dilute the elite status of the college. This led him to several conflicts with the state’s higher education authorities of the time which continued for almost the entire second half of his tenure at the college. He was a very vocal proponent of autonomy for Presidency College but that did not happen during his tenure, although the institution has now been converted into a university. It is also widely believed that he was passed over for several appointments and positions because he did not see eye-to-eye with the authorities controlling the education system.It is to our great pleasure and satisfaction that in 2012, on Teacher’s Day (September 5), we could felicitate Prof Gun, together with his contemporaries Prof Milan K. Gupta and Prof Bhagbat Dasgupta, at Presidency University on their attaining the milestone of 80 years. And although we did not realise it at the time, it was later pointed out that the year 2012 also marked the 50th year of the publication of the famous book, Fundamentals of Statistics, co-authored by these three legendary professors. And this year, 2020, marks the 50th year of their other famous book, An Outline of Statistical Theory. One is amazed to think that over the last five-six decades no other textbook has come to the market which could effectively replace these epic texts; and that too in a modern subject like statistics which is constantly evolving. Generations of statisticians, many of whom have never seen Prof Gun, or professors Gupta and Dasgupta, have learnt the subject through these textbooks, and the same may happen for many generations in future.  The entire community should be grateful to them for leaving behind such valuable resources for us.It is also my great personal satisfaction that I got to dedicate one of my own books to him. In 2016, I wrote a book on predictive analytics with my wife Srabashi, who was also a student of Prof Gun and my classmate at Presidency College. We were very happy to pay our intellectual debt to him through the dedication, and he was also very happy when we visited him at his residence to present him a copy of the book. That was in 2016, and it was my last meeting with him.The demise of Prof Gun signals the end of an era. I consider myself to be fortunate to have him as my first statistics mentor.(Ayanendranath Basu is a professor at Indian Statistical Institute)",2020-12-09 21:43:00

1939,Calcutta,Focus on New Town - Telegraph India,"We are very lucky that from our housing complex we can get a bird’s eye view of all the prominent landmarks of New Town, from Biswa Bangla Gate, Convention Centre, Hanuman temple, Seven Wonders in Eco Park... I wanted to document the landscape of New Town as it is now before all of the empty spaces get filled up.It was a cloudy evening. The towers of Rosedale Garden could be seen afar. Dark clouds were looming in the horizon. I clicked the black and white frame to highlight a big city under turbulence. It was clicked before the pandemic came upon us, but it did turn out to be prophetic.Last September, I was passing by when I spotted kashphul waving in the wind. I realised they would make for a great shot during sunset when I would get the perfect backlight. So I drove back later with camera. I love landscape and astro photography. Mobile photographyI may be staying in the US now since 2018 but my heart is still back in New Town. I had clicked this picture at the Cafe Ajante side of Eco Park, This boy was staring at the water for long. It struck me that there is an Apu of Pather Panchali in each of us, who finds wonderment and joy in sights of nature.I clicked this picture just the other day in August. The towers of our complex were visible atop and I lay in wait for a flight to pass. When one did, I clicked and there it was. When I heard of contest a few days later, I had the entry ready in hand.This is the first time I am taking part in a contest. The picture was clicked in Eco Park last December during sunset. New Town by itself is a scenic township. Eco Park and Biswa Bangla Gate are my favourite spots. There is also scope for bird photography.JudgespeakThis contest received so many great entries that I spent sleepless nights judging them. For two nights in a row, I sat from 10.30pm till 3.30 or 4am marking them. We used parameters like uniqueness, story-telling ability, composition and framing to make our choices. The contest allowed DSLR as well as mobile phone clicks and the ratio of the two would be 15:85. New Town residents are blessed with picturesque locales nearby and we received lots of pictures of Biswa Bangla Gate, Eco Park and the sunset in the wetlands. It helps, of course, that the air pollution here is relatively less than in the rest of the city.

1949,Calcutta,Cyclone Amphan: Raw wounds of Red Road - Telegraph India,"Uprooted trees pockmark one flank of Red Road, one of the most picturesque and historical stretches of Calcutta, on Friday.  Even three days after Cyclone Amphan struck, during which some of the debris has been cleared, the margins of the road bear the marks of the merciless assault. On Thursday, the morning after Amphan struck, the trail of destruction along Red Road captured the calamity that befell south Bengal. The unbroken chain of twisted trees made the belt, facing Fort William,  resemble a battlefield. In the Second World War, the majestic stretch was the landing ground for British fighter planes defending Calcutta.The British fighter squadrons were called Hurricanes, a name that sounds ironical nearly 78 years later when Amphan launched little else but a devastating bombing run on a city Red Road had once helped protect. Among the targets on Wednesday evening were the famed balustrades that flank Red Road. Parts of the balustrades were crushed by the trees that fell on Wednesday evening. In 1942, the ornamental balustrades had posed a challenge to the landing skills of the pilots. Occasional mishaps were reported but none similar to the consequences brought about by the cyclone now. The long, hard road to normality",

2027,Calcutta,Coronavirus lockdown: After 74 days malls reopen in Kolkata  - Telegraph India,"The long and hard trek back to everyday business began on Monday. It cannot be a one-day affair but meet some of the Calcuttans who stepped out and spent money to rediscover some of the joys of life that we once took for granted.The familiar hum and the sprint to grab a just-vacated seat was missing but the food court at South City mall had several diners on Monday afternoon. The functional eatery was suddenly an elegant dining option where people sat unhurried. Once people took the seats, it was apparent that keeping distance was not always very difficult if there was a will. South City Group vice-president Man Mohan Bagree travelled back in time to 2008. “It was giving me a feeling of actually launching a new property... the same experience that we had in January 16, 2008,” he said, referring to the reopening of the mall on Monday after the  lockdown. “We were very excited and looking for a good footfall but we faced a lot of challenges also... we hope the mall to be fully operational by tomorrow (Tuesday) or the day after,” said Bagree. “The food court is open and restaurants will open in a phased manner. Almost all shops are open. It is a learning time for all of us. Apart from managing a mall, it is also about managing corona. You cannot frisk people also, which is a major concern. We have kept it cool and casual,” he said. For Saket Mohta, MD, Merlin Group and developer of Acropolis, it was “a wow feeling” to see Acropolis back to its hang-out avatar after 80 days. “I really felt suffocated when the lockdown was announced as normal life was paralysed but it was for the welfare of people. I love to go to the mall and am a regular at Starbucks coffee shop and Ozora (the rooftop hang-out spot). We at Acropolis mall asked all brands to open and almost 60 per cent brands opened today,” he said. A shopper does not a revival make but a beginning was made on Monday when lifestyle hangouts opened in Calcutta after 74 days and some Calcuttans made it a point to make a purchase or grab a bite.",
